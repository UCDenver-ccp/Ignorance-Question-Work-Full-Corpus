"Headliners: Maternal Nutrition and Child Cancer: Mother’s Pre-pregnancy Diet May Influence Child Cancer Risk\nJensen CD, Block G, Buffler P, Ma X, Selvin S, Month S. 2004.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer (with 2,400 cases diagnosed each year in those under age 20) and the second most common cause of mortality in children aged 1–14.",0
Recent research has confirmed that ALL can originate in utero .,0
New findings from the NIEHS-funded Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study (NCCLS) show that the disease may originate even earlier—in the foods a woman eats before she even becomes pregnant.,0
"The effect of maternal diet on child leukemia risk has not been rigorously studied; the few studies that have been done have focused on specific dietary factors, and the results have been mixed.",0
It is the first study to capture mothers’ overall dietary patterns and relate them to child leukemia.,0
"The researchers found that the more vegetables, fruits, and proteins a woman ate, the lower the risk of her child having leukemia.",0
"Of the vegetables and fruits, carrots and cantaloupe showed the highest inverse effect, perhaps because of these foods’ high carotenoid content.",0
String beans and peas also correlated inversely with ALL risk.,0
"Among the proteins, beef and beans—both sources of the antioxidant glutathione—showed the highest inverse effect.",0
"The authors stress that dietary factors work together, and no one food should be singled out in attributing risk or benefit.",0
"Further, a cause-and-effect relationship can not be concluded from this study.",0
"However, they write, it remains prudent for women who are pregnant or think they may become pregnant to eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables.",0
Lesions of testis and epididymis associated with prenatal diethylstilbestrol exposure.,0
The main aim was to study factors identified in a previous study as potentially causally related to cancer of the oesophagus.,0
"Other tumours (lung, stomach, breast, large bowel, larynx and pharynx) were included to distinguish findings specific for oesophageal cancer from general characteristics of cancer patients, due for example to ascertainment bias, and to verify that expected associations, such as between lung cancer and cigarette smoking, would emerge under the prevailing field conditions.",0
"The use of opium, bread and tea could not be assessed in the retrospective framework.",0
Strongly associated with risk of oesophageal cancer were low socio-economic status and low intake of fresh fruit and vegetables.,0
"The two factors each had an independent effect, and were more marked for oesophageal cancer than for the other tumours.",0
Recent nationwide shortages of low-calcium formula (LCF) suggest this problem may be widespread.,0
CYP24A1 mutations have been identified as a potential cause of IIH.,0
"To determine if IIH is occurring more commonly, de-identified, first-measured serum calcium from all infants <6 months (n=5796) measured in our laboratory, were grouped by years 2005-2007 (n=1516), 2008-2010 (n=1945) and 2011-2013 (n=2335).",0
"PTH was not elevated (median 1.0pmol/L [<0.3-3.1]), urinary calcium: creatinine ratio not suppressed (median 2.3, [0.4-9]), 25OHVitD low-normal (median 44nmol/L [17-218]) and 1,25(OH)2VitD elevated (median 232pmol/L [64-720]), in keeping with an abnormality in CYP24A1.",0
"In 7/10 infants with data available, treated with LCF for median 95 days (range 25-310), median PTH rose to 17.1pmol/L ([8.2-49.3], P=0.02) with a trend to lower 25OHVit D (median 23nmol/L [<10-108], P=0.09) despite continued high-normal calcium levels (median 2.66mmol/L [2.11-2.75]).",0
Concurrent changes in rates of hyper and hypo-calcaemia suggest antenatal vitamin D3supplementation as an aetiological factor.,0
"IIH was associated with significant morbidity, including symptomatic hypercalcaemia and nephrocalcinosis.",0
"Treatment with LCF prevented further symptomatic hypercalcaemia, but resulted in elevated PTH.",0
The biochemistry of our patients with IIH raises variations in Vitamin D metabolism or calcium set-point as potential associated factors.,0
Nutrition for the primary care provider\nThis book focuses on the various nutritional aspects of the current needs of the society at large and for the health practitioners.,0
"It would have been worthwhile to include some more topics such as management of severely acute malnutrition, examples of high, low and moderate glycaemic index foods, how to read food labels (with examples), etc and also additional references for further reading would have been beneficial as the chapters are a quick guide to appraise the topic.",0
Visfatin as a predictor for growth of fetus and infant\n\nAbstract\n\nObjective:\nVisfatin is an adipocytokine that functions as an enzyme and a growth factor to investigate the relationship between serum visfatin and the fetus’s anthropometric markers up to a year after birth.,0
"In group A, there was a strong positive relationship between birth head circumference and the first (p1=0.054, r1=0.580) and second trimester visfatin levels (p2=0.051, r2=0.530).",0
"In group B, second trimester visfatin levels correlated negatively with birth length (p=0.015, r=-0.523) and infant’s head circumference (p2=0.050, r2=-0.392).",0
"In a separate study on group B, visfatin levels in the first and second trimesters showed a significant negative correlation with infant’s weight.",0
"A significant correlation was observed between the first and second trimesters visfatin level with infant’s height in both groups, such that this relationship was positive in group A and negative in group B.",0
Linear regression analysis revealed that first and second trimester visfatin levels were significant independent predictors of infant’s weight in group B and infant’s height in both groups.,0
Second trimester visfatin level was a significant predictor of birth height in group B.,0
"Conclusion:\nMaternal serum visfatin level shows a relationship with fetal and infant anthropometric indicators, with different effects in the two groups, suggesting visfatin dysfunction in the overweight group before pregnancy.",0
"PRECIS: We measured the serum visfatin level in pregnancy, and assess its relationship with the children’s anthropometric markers, to determine if it can be used as biomarker.",0
"Introduction\nBy releasing adipokines, adipose tissue has a major role in fertility, and physical and sexual maturation(1).",0
"Visfatin, a new 52KDa adipokine(2), was renamed to nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (Nampt) in 2002 after it was shown that it encodes an enzyme called Nampt, which is involved in the conversion of nicotinamide into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)(3).",0
"Yet, visfatin’s regulatory and release mechanisms in the fetus and neonate are still unclear(5).",0
"It is probably regulated by glucose and insulin(6), and increases with gradual degradation of B-cell and progress of insulin-resistance and maternal weight(7).",0
Many studies have shown that increased visfatin levels in maternal plasma are associated with small-for-gestantional-age births(8)and intrauterine growth restriction(9).,0
"Strong relationships have recently been reported between serum visfatin levels in the first trimester of pregnancy and insulin secretion in the fetus and final birth weight, which shows the role of visfatin secretion in early pregnancy in the later metabolic modeling of the fetus(11).",0
These results suggest that visfatin may play an important role in maternal-fetal metabolic interaction.,0
"However, due to the lack of sufficient information about the physiologic role of visfatin in adults, its source and regulation mechanism in fetal and neonatal stages cannot be argued absolutely.",0
"To investigate the role of visfatin in the growth of the fetus and up to a year after birth, we measured serum visfatin levels during 6-12 and 15-20 weeks of gestation in an Iranian population.",0
"The relationship between visfatin level and neonatal anthropometric indicators at birth\nIn group A, a strong positive relationship was observed between birth head circumference and the first (p1=0.05, r1=0.580) and second trimester visfatin levels (p2=0.051, r2=0.530).",0
"Spearman Rank correlation test showed a negative significant relationship between second trimester visfatin level and birth height (p=0.015, r=-0.523) in group B (Table 2).",0
Linear regression analysis revealed that the second trimester visfatin level was a significant predictor of birth height in group B (Table 3).,0
"Significant correlations were observed in both groups between first trimester visfatin (pa=0.002, ra=0.713, pb=0.005, rb=-0.540, in A and B group, respectively) and second trimester visfatin (pa=0.009, ra=0.628 and pb=0.008, rb=-0.518, in groups A and B, respectively) with infant’s height.",0
This correlation was positive in group A and negative in group B.,0
"According to the Lambda test, this correlation was significantly greater in group A than in group B (p<0.05).",0
"A negative and significant correlation was separately found between infant’s weight and the first (p1=0.024, r1=-0.450) and second trimester visfatin levels (p2=0.005, r2=-0.540) in group B.",0
"Generally, the relationship between visfatin and the infants’s growth indicators was positive in group A and negative in group B.",0
"A strong negative correlation was separately found between the second trimester visfatin level and infant’s head circumference (p2=0.05, r2=-0.392) in group B (Table 2).",0
Linear regression analysis revealed that first and second trimester visfatin levels were significant predictors of infant’s weight in group B and infant’s height in both groups (Table 3).,0
Discussion\nNo study has yet been conducted to assess the relationship between maternal serum visfatin and neonatal anthropometric indicators by categorizing mothers based on BMI.,0
The visfatin regulation mechanism in human fetal blood circulation is unknown(12).,0
"However, recent studies have proposed the presence of a relationship between maternal serum visfatin level and fetal growth.",0
"A strong relationship was found between maternal serum visfatin and neonatal anthropometric indicators in groups A and B, with a possible mechanism of maternal visfatin entering the fetal blood circulation through the placenta as a result of endocrine changes.",0
"Moreover, umbilical cord serum visfatin concentrations were found to have a positive relationship with insulin levels(13).",0
Mazaki-Tovi analyzed the relationship of increased maternal serum visfatin with gestational diabetes mellitus infection and the birth of LGA infants.,0
One of the reasons for a visfatin effect on fetal development is its effect on sirtuins (SIRT).,0
"SIRTs are a class of\xa0proteins\xa0that have a role in cellular processes associated with body metabolism such as cell differentiation, aging,\xa0transcription,\xa0apoptosis,\xa0inflammation,\xa0and stress resistance, as well as energy efficiency and alertness during\xa0low-calorie situations.",0
"SIRT 1 (SIRT1) affects chromatin modulation, and therefore suppresses transcription and interacts with transcription factors, and is capable of positive or negative regulation of gene expression(15).",0
"Through involvement in NAD+synthesis needed for SIRT activity, visfatin has a major role in the regulation of SIRT1-dependent transcription, and this leads to the metabolism of energy and differentiation of stem cells.",0
"This means that Nampt promotes osteocyte differentiation through a pathway mediated by SIRT1(16,17).",0
High levels of SIRT1 expression in the human brain have been revealed(18).,0
"SIRTs have an important role in the process of synapse promotion and modulation of their strength, which is important for memory formation.",0
"During neuronal development, SIRT1 has a important role in promoting xonal elongation, neurite outgrowth, and dendritic branching via several targets and mechanisms(19).",0
The NAD+dependent deacetylase SIRT1 is implicated in energy balance regulation by its effect on pro-opiomelanocortin and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamusthis(20).,0
Obesity is correlated with low NAD+/SIRT pathway expression in adipose tissue of BMI-discordant monozygotic twins(22).,0
"The selective knock-out of SIRT1 in hypothalamic AgRP neurons diminished response to hunger-inducing hormone ghrelin, reduced food intake, consequently causing decreased lean mass and body weight(23).",0
"The persistence of the relationship between postpartum maternal serum visfatin levels and anthropometric indicators can be attributed to excretion of visfatin in mother’s milk, which was confirmed by Bienertová-Vašků et al.(25).",0
"Based on maternal colostrum visfatin levels, the aurors were able to predict neonatal weight loss in the first three days of birth(25,26).",0
"Visfatin by effect on the production of SIRT1, consequently, interference in the development of the brain and energy balance regulation may be associated with head circumferences and weights of fetus and child.",0
"According to these results, visfatin can have a major role in regulating neonatal obesity after birth.",0
The above studies confirm the present study results.,0
"Generally, these results show that visfatin has a major role in maternal-fetal metabolic interaction.",0
"Our results further show different metabolic regulations in groups A and B, which may be due to differences in expression of SIRT1, glucose transfer or insulin resistance as a result of resistance to glucose entry to fetal tissues for unknown reasons, which require further studies.",0
It is likely that visfatin can be used in the future as a biomarker predicting fetal and neonatal growth.,0
Study Limitations\nThis study provides useful data of the relationship between serum visfatin and the children’s anthropometric markers up to a year after birth.,0
"However, the present study has some limitations.",0
"First, we know that it would be better to evaluate levels of cord plasma and breast milk concentrations of visfatin and assess their correlation with the children’s anthropometric in order to support our results.",0
"However, we could not do it, which is a limitation of our study.",0
We suggest the long-term fallow up of mothers and infants with more abundant sample.,0
"Conclusion\nAfter a careful review of previous studies on visfatin and pregnancy, we can claim the present study is the first in Iran to have specifically addressed the relationship between maternal visfatin levels and infant’s anthropometric indicators up to a year after birth.",0
Our study can be the basis for further and more precise studies.,0
"According to the present study results, mean serum visfatin levels were higher in the second trimester compared with the first.",0
"In the present study, the relationship between prenatal visfatin level and infant’s anthropometric indicators in the two years following childbirth was assessed.",0
"Serum visfatin level appears to be related to the fetus and infant’s anthropometric indicators (infant’s weight, height and birth height.",0
First and second trimester visfatin levels were significant independent predictors of infant’s weight in group B and infant’s height in both groups.,0
"The second trimester visfatin level was a significant predictor of birth height in group B. Visfatin has extensive effects on pregnancy physiology and pathology, maternal and especially neonatal outcomes, and its effect is different in normal weight and overweight women.",0
"Hence, pre-pregnancy BMI appears to be a determining factor in creating the difference and the amount of maternal plasma visfatin during pregnancy, which can predict maternal serum visfatin and neonatal and maternal outcomes.",0
It is recommended that future studies be conducted with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods.,0
Results from an international case-control study of childhood brain tumors: the role of prenatal vitamin supplementation.,0
"Although risk estimates varied by study center, combined results suggest that maternal supplementation for two trimesters may decrease risk of brain tumor (odds ratio [OR] 0.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5-0.9), with a trend of less risk with longer duration of use (p trend = 0.0007).",0
"These findings are largely driven by data from the United States, where most mothers took vitamins.",0
"Mothers also took individual micronutrient supplements (e.g., vitamin C tablets), but most mothers who took these also took multivitamins, making it impossible to determine potential independent effects of these micronutrients.",0
Reproductive Toxicity: Too Much of a Good Thing?,0
"Pregnant women are famously exhorted to faithfully take their daily prenatal vitamins, which often contain iron and other minerals.",0
But new research suggests that a weekly iron supplement coinciding with the renewal of the small intestine’s mucosal lining cells (where nutrient absorption occurs) works better than a daily supplement and prevents problems resulting from too much iron at the wrong times.,0
"None of the women were anemic at that point, but 66% had low levels of ferritin (the principal form of stored iron), suggesting low iron nutritional status.",0
"Ironically, both early gestational iron-deficiency anemia and hemoconcentration later in pregnancy increase the risk of premature birth and low birth weight.",0
"Thus, the researchers suggest that excess iron supplementation can cause the same problems it is supposed to correct.",0
"Animal studies suggest that excess iron can also trigger formation of free radicals in the intestinal mucosa and other tissues, and that both iron deficiency and iron overload can damage nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA.",0
This kind of damage has been implicated in cancer induction.,0
"The intestinal mucosa is renewed every 5 to 6 days and will absorb as much iron as necessary to maintain iron balance; however, mature cells will stop absorbing iron entirely if they are flooded with it, even if there is an iron deficit.",0
"A more subtly calibrated iron supplementation during pregnancy may be as effective as current public health recommendations, and perhaps safer.",0
The Beat\n\nSavory Relief for Arsenic Poisoning?,0
"In the February 2008 issue of Food and Chemical Toxicology , researchers from India report that aqueous garlic extract (AGE) fed to at-risk individuals may reduce the toxic effects of arsenic.",0
"The researchers believe the antioxidant properties of garlic, along with the chelating efficacy exhibited, led to the success of the treatment.",0
In Utero Cigarette Smoke Exposure and Age at Menopause\nIt is well documented that women who smoke cigarettes begin menopause earlier than nonsmokers.,0
"Moreover, previously noted associations between current smoking and age at menopause were not observed among these women.",0
"These birds, which lived in northeastern Siberia, northern Alaska, and northern Greenland, are believed to have had no contact with humans.",0
"The researchers proposed three possible explanations for their findings: the birds could have been exposed to the bacteria through contact with other species of birds migrating from other regions, or resistance could have developed either through spontaneous mutations or through horizontal gene transfer from other microbes.",0
"This rule, the first of its kind in the world, will apply mainly to personal care products but also could apply to other categories such as food and textiles.",0
The group cites insufficient evidence on the impact of nanomaterials on the environment and human health.,0
"China Begins National Survey of Pollution Sources\nAlthough China has set goals to cut emissions of major pollutants, emissions of sulfur dioxide and some indicators of poor water quality increased in 2006.",0
Experts have decried the lack of trustworthy statistics on the sources and extent of pollution and the number of remediation facilities.,0
Ancient Chinese Cancer Secret?,0
"In the clinical trials, compounds from the venom have proven beneficial and caused no apparent side effects in patients with advanced liver, pancreatic, or lung cancer.",0
"Cardiac glycosides in the venom are thought to inhibit proteins that promote cancer cell growth, thereby causing cancer cell death.",0
"Although potentially toxic at high doses, these glycosides are used to treat congestive heart failure.",0
"Currently, the venom-based treatment is administered by injection, but the Texas researchers hope to develop a pill form.",0
Respond\nIn response to Prasad’s constructive comments on our quantitative meta-analysis of the estrogen hypothesis and testicular dysgenesis syndrome (Martin et al.,0
"2008), we offer the following observations regarding the scope of our study and limitations of the methodology applied.",0
"It cannot, however, correct for potential bias and confounding of the studies included; we addressed this issue in our review (Martin et al.",0
"In previous work and a scoping study, we found that most of the research carried out in relation to impaired spermatogenesis had investigated time trends rather than association with specific risk factors (Martin et al.",0
"Further, our analysis was limited to prenatal exposure to estrogenic agents.",0
A number of studies have found associations between sperm motility or sperm DNA damage with levels of estrogenic chemicals measured either in urine or serum (Duty et al.,0
It would not be possible however to relate such levels to prenatal exposure.,0
This also illustrates the difficulty of selecting a suitable marker of impaired spermatotogenesis.,0
Our study was implicitly limited to congenital cryptorchidism because the literature search did not yield any case–control or cohort studies that addressed the question of prenatal exposure to estrogenic compounds and acquired cryptorchidism in humans.,0
"We concluded that the significant association between prenatal diethylstilbestrol exposure and all three end points considered conferred weight to the hypothesis of a common etiology for these disorders, and therefore to the existence of a testicular dysgenesis syndrome (Martin et al.",0
"Separate analyses were carried out for the three end points but the methodology applied did not allow us to explore the specific nature of causal relationships between congenital cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and testicular cancer.",0
"As gestational diabetes is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, and has long-term implications for both mother and child, it is important that it is recognized and appropriately managed.",0
"This review will examine the pharmacological options for the management of gestational diabetes, as well as the evidence for blood glucose monitoring, dietary and exercise therapy.",0
"The medical management of gestational diabetes is still evolving, and recent randomized controlled trials have added considerably to our knowledge in this area.",0
"As insulin therapy is effective and safe, it is considered the gold standard of pharmacotherapy for gestational diabetes, against which other treatments have been compared.",0
"The current experience is that the short acting insulin analogs lispro and aspart are safe, but there are only limited data to support the use of long acting insulin analogs.",0
There are randomized controlled trials which have demonstrated efficacy of the oral agents glyburide and metformin.,0
"Whilst short-term data have not demonstrated adverse effects of glyburide and metformin on the fetus, and they are increasingly being used in pregnancy, there remain long-term concerns regarding their potential for harm.",0
"Background\nGestational diabetes (GDM) is defined as “carbohydrate intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy”.1Large studies have found that GDM occurs in 2.2%–8.8% of pregnancies, depending on the ethnic mix of the population and the criteria used for diagnosis.2In some specific populations however, the incidence can be considerably higher.",0
"Essentially, women at risk of type 2 diabetes are at risk of GDM.",0
"The key factor which results in the development of gestational diabetes appears to be a failure to compensate with increased insulin secretion.3As the increase in insulin resistance is greatest in the third trimester, GDM usually develops going into this period.",0
"Therefore, screening for GDM usually occurs around 24–28 weeks into the pregnancy.",0
"The diagnosis is made with an oral glucose tolerance test, though the criteria vary around the world (Table 1).",0
"Risk factors for the development of GDM include obesity, older age, family history, previous history of GDM or poor obstetric outcomes, ethnicity, polycystic ovary syndrome and as more recently noted, hypertension.4,5\nThe major significance of GDM is that it is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.",0
"Macrosomia, shoulder dystocia with its attendant risks of brachial plexus injury and clavicle fracture, and neonatal hypoglycemia are the serious complications which most commonly occur.6–11Jaundice, polycythemia, respiratory distress, and hypocalcemia have also been reported.",0
"Additionally, there are some data that suggest an increase in fetal malformation and perinatal mortality.7,12–15The above risks can be minimized with good glycemic control and judicious obstetric care.",0
"Cesarean sections are also more common, and GDM is associated with a higher risk of pre-eclampsia.9–11\nExposure of the fetus to hyperglycemia may also predispose the child to a diabetes phenotype in later life.",0
"This has been elegantly demonstrated by the long-term follow-up of the offspring of Pima Indian mothers.16,17Offspring who were born to mothers who were already diabetic when pregnant had a 45% likelihood of type 2 diabetes by the age of 20–24, whereas it was 8.6% amongst those with mothers who only developed diabetes after pregnancy (ie, were prediabetic).",0
"Amongst sibships discordant for exposure to hyperglycemia, the sibling exposed to hyperglycemia had a considerably higher risk of subsequent diabetes, suggesting that genetic factors were not predominantly responsible for the difference in diabetes incidence.",0
"Since then, numerous other observational studies have shown that the offspring of diabetic pregnancies have a higher risk of developing a diabetes phenotype.18,19There is also concern that this leads to an intergenerational effect, with GDM promoting diabetes in the offspring, with perpetuation of the vicious cycle when the offspring herself develops GDM, thereby predisposing the grandchild to the development of diabetes as well.20It is unknown however, what degree of hyperglycemia, or indeed if it is related metabolic disturbances, which increases the risk of diabetes to the offspring.",0
Evidence from more contemporary populations is that the likelihood of subsequent diabetes may be substantially higher.22Women who have had GDM account for a significant burden of the population prevalence of diabetes.,0
"It has been estimated that up to one third of women with diabetes, had a GDM pregnancy earlier in their life,2though this was not evident in a recent survey of women with type 2 diabetes.23\nThis review will focus on the medical management of GDM, in particular self monitoring of blood glucose and diabetes education, dietary therapy and physical activity, pharmacotherapy, and post-partum management.",0
"For an excellent discussion of the obstetric management of GDM, I will refer the reader to the review by Conway.24\n\nDiabetes education, self-monitoring of blood glucose, dietary therapy, and exercise\nSelf-care is an important component of the management of GDM.",0
The involvement of a dietician and diabetes educator experienced in the care of women with GDM will facilitate these areas of management.,0
Blood glucose monitoring\nWomen with GDM should perform home blood glucose monitoring.,0
Treatment to post-prandial targets results in superior pregnancy outcomes compared to pre-prandial targets.25The recommended treatment targets vary from country to country (Table 2).,0
These are largely consensus-based as the risk of complications is continuous and there are no obvious thresholds above which the risk markedly increases.,0
Lifestyle measures can provide adequate control in the majority of cases.,0
"If glucose targets are not adequately met by lifestyle measures, and perhaps a review of dietary intake, then pharmacotherapy should be introduced.",0
"Rather than basing the need for insulin on glycemic parameters alone, some have advocated the combined use of ultrasound assessment of fetal abdominal circumference in combination with blood glucose levels.",0
Dietary therapy\nIt is generally accepted that dietary therapy is the cornerstone of treatment of GDM.,0
Therefore all women with GDM should receive counseling from a specialist dietitian.,0
The aim is to achieve normoglycemia whilst providing the required nutrients for normal fetal growth and maternal health.,0
"There are few trials examining the efficacy of dietary therapy for GDM, However, a cluster randomized controlled study has provided support for Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) for GDM, as recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (2004).",0
"In this study, 215 women with GDM were seen at sites randomized to deliver either MNT or standard care.27Fewer subjects in the MNT group required insulin (24.6% vs 31.7%, p = 0.05) and there was a trend to fewer women having a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) >6% (8.1% vs 13.6%, p = 0.25).",0
"The ADA states that all women should receive individualized counseling to provide adequate calories and nutrients to meet the needs of pregnancy and consistent with the blood glucose goals (fasting ≤105 mg/dl [5.8 mmol/L], 1 hr ≤155 mg/dl [8.6 mmol/L], and 2 hrs ≤130 mg/dl [7.2 mmol/L]).",0
"For obese women, a 30%–33% calorie restriction to approximately 25 kcal/kg actual weight per day is recommended.",0
Carbohydrate should be restricted to 35%–40% of calories.,0
"There are also data to support low carbohydrate diets in pregnancy, and for the carbohydrate to be of low glycemic index.",0
"In a nonrandomized study, women with GDM on a diet comprising less than 42% carbohydrate, had lower post-prandial glucose levels, were less likely to require insulin, and had a lower incidence of large for gestational age.28A small study which randomized pregnant women to low glycemic index (GI) or high GI diets found that the former resulted in lower glucose levels, a blunting of the pregnancy associated rise in insulin resistance, and lower birthweight.29In another study of GI, women assigned to a low GI diet during pregnancy gave birth to infants who were lighter (3408 ± 78 g vs 3644 ± 90 g) and had a lower incidence of large for gestational age, compared to women given a high GI diet.30Both diets comprised 55% carbohydrate.",0
"Whilst the latter studies were not specifically performed in women with GDM, they suggest that the concept of GI is valid in pregnancy, and it would be appropriate to recommend low GI carbohydrate to women with GDM.",0
Additional dietary measures are usually based upon the general recommendations for diabetes mellitus.,0
A reduction in simple carbohydrates and fat intake is advisable.,0
"Emphasis is given to spreading the dietary intake over six meals daily, with three main meals and three snacks, in order to avoid large carbohydrate loads at any time.",0
"Except for saccharin, which can cross the placenta and is therefore not recommended, other noncaloric sweeteners may be used in moderation.",0
"Physical activity\nIn people with type 2 diabetes, there is ample evidence that regular physical activity enhances insulin sensitivity, facilitates weight loss, and thereby improves glucose control.",0
"Several small studies have examined whether regular exercise is also beneficial in the management of GDM Jovanavic-Petersen randomized 19 women with GDM to a regime of diet alone, or diet with 20 minutes of supervised aerobic training three days per week for six weeks.31This modest amount of physical activity resulted in lower fasting glucose levels, lower glucose responses to a glucose challenge, and a lower HbA1c.",0
"Another study randomized 29 women with GDM to 30 minutes of exercise at 70% estimated maximal heart rate, 3–4 times per week, or control.32There was a trend to improved glucose levels in those who exercised, which did not reach significance.",0
"Measures of cardiorespiratory fitness however, improved.",0
"A study of 32 women randomized to circuit type exercise three times a week or control, found that resistance training resulted in lower postprandial glucose levels, and a delay in the requirement of insulin.33Amongst women with a prepregnancy BMI > 25, those who were in the exercise arm were less likely to require insulin.",0
"Therefore, it seems reasonable to recommend that when there is no medical or obstetric contraindication, women with GDM should maintain a sensible level of light and moderate intensity physical activity until the latter stages of the pregnancy.",0
"The above studies provide reassurance that moderate intensity activities such as walking for 20–30 minutes each day, and attendance at antenatal exercise classes can be safely encouraged, and that modest improvements in glycemic control might be achieved.",0
"Insulin therapy for gestational diabetes\nWhen treatment targets are not achieved by dietary means, then insulin is required.",0
"In some cases, an additional morning injection of basal insulin may further improve glycemic control.",0
"As the level of insulin resistance varies from person to person, it is common practice to commence the woman on small doses of insulin, and then to increase the doses at frequent intervals until target glucose levels are attained.",0
The required dosage of insulin usually increases gradually over the third trimester of pregnancy.,0
This may be an early indicator of placental insufficiency.,0
Frequent review and titration of the insulin dosage is recommended.,0
"Unlike the situation for women with pre-existing type 1 diabetes however, significant hypoglycemia is uncommon in women with insulin-treated GDM.",0
Nonetheless the woman should be advised regarding appropriate hypoglycemia prevention and management measures.,0
"For many years, fast-acting (regular) insulin, and intermediate-acting (isophane) insulin have been the preferred insulins for the treatment of GDM.",0
"Human insulin does not normally cross the placenta, though antibody bound animal insulin has been reported to do so.35However, it has been shown by36Jovanovic that it is maternal glucose control, rather than maternal anti-insulin antibody levels which influence birthweight.36Human insulin is considered safe in pregnancy as years of experience has not suggested an increase in fetal complications as a consequence of its use.",0
"There is now increasing evidence that the newer rapid acting insulin analogs lispro and aspart are also safe in pregnancy, and indeed, they are commonly used.",0
"Although there was an initial small uncontrolled report which suggested that Lispro may have teratogenic effects when used in type 1 diabetic pregnancy,37this has not been borne out in subsequent studies.",0
"No increase in pregnancy complications have been found in observational studies where lispro was used, in either women with GDM38,43or pre-existing diabetes.38–43There are few reports regarding the use of aspart in pregnancy.",0
"However, a large randomized controlled trial comparing aspart with regular human insulin in 322 pregnant women with type 1 diabetes has been performed.44Comparable birth outcomes were found between the two arms, suggesting that aspart is as safe and effective as human insulin.",0
"They have all demonstrated that the rapid acting analogues are as effective as regular insulin in the treatment of GDM, with comparable, if not favorable, outcomes (Table 3).",0
"In one study, aspart was detected in the cord blood for one subject.45However, as it was not detected in other subjects, the authors postulated that this was due to the disruption of the uterine-placental barrier during delivery, when the mother had been receiving an aspart infusion.",0
As yet there have been no reports of the use of glulisine in pregnancy.,0
Data regarding the long-acting insulin analogs are less clear than for rapid-acting analogs.,0
There are a number of case reports and small case series of glargine being utilized without the development of pregnancy complications.,0
The majority of these have been in patients with type 1 diabetes.,0
"There are also data from a total of 48 women with GDM.46,47To date no randomized controlled studies have been published.",0
"Concerns have been expressed about the use of glargine in pregnancy, because of its potential effect on mitogenesis, mediated by its high affinity to the IGF-1 receptor, which is six times that of natural insulin48,49Whilst insulin detemir has a lower binding affinity to the IGF-1 receptor than natural insulin, there is even less information regarding its use in pregnancy.",0
"Although their safety has not been proven, it is often rationalized that a change in the basal insulin will result in deterioration in glycemic control, and therefore the risk of continuing glargine is less than the risk from changing insulins.",0
"However, until their safety in pregnancy can be clearly established, the initiation of long-acting insulin analog therapy in women with GDM cannot be recommended.",0
Oral antidiabetic agents in gestational diabetes\nThere is controversy regarding the use of oral hypoglycemic agents during pregnancy.,0
"Most government drug agencies have not approved their use in pregnancy, and major specialty diabetes organizations recommend that oral agents be ceased if the woman had been taking them pre-pregnancy53–55There have now however, been randomized trials conducted with both glyburide and metformin which have not demonstrated short term harm to the pregnancy.",0
"Glyburide (Glibenclamide)\nAmerican authors have stated that glyburide has replaced insulin as first line pharmacological treatment of GDM in many practices.56This has largely occurred on the basis of a randomized controlled trial where 404 women with GDM were treated with glyburide (up to 20 mg/day) or insulin57In this study, the level of glycemic control achieved was the same in both groups (mean glucose concentration during treatment with glyburide 5.9 ± 0.9 mmol/L compared to 5.9 ± 1.0 mmol/L in insulin group).",0
Only 4% of women treated with glyburide achieved inadequate control and required a switch to insulin.,0
"Additionally, a number of nonrandomized or retrospective studies examining the treatment of GDM with glyburide have been reported (Table 4).",0
"In general, these indicate that glyburide is effective in achieving glycemic control in the majority of patients.",0
"Most, but not all, suggest that glyburide is as safe as insulin for the fetus.",0
"A meta-analysis which included the above studies as well as others examining women with pre-existing diabetes, with 745 glyburide exposed pregnancies and 637 treated with insulin, has been performed.65This study found that glyburide did not increase the risk of macrosomia, large for gestational age, or neonatal hypoglycemia, but did not examine more serious consequences such as perinatal mortality or congenital anomalies.",0
Several studies have examined factors which predict failure of glyburide to achieve adequate glycemic control.,0
"Higher glucose levels, either in the glucose tolerance test upon which GDM was diagnosed, or on self-monitoring, and early dietary failure have been found to be associated with glyburide failure.60,58These findings lead to the logical conclusion that subjects with more severe GDM are more likely to require insulin.",0
"Further evidence supporting the safety of glyburide for the fetus comes from a study using an in vitro perfusion, where it was not found to cross the placenta in significant amounts.66However, another in vitro study has found transplacental transfer of glyburide.67In the Langer randomized controlled trial, glyburide was not detected in the cord blood of the neonates and cord insulin levels were similar between the two groups.57\n\nMetformin\nA number of studies have provided conflicting information regarding the safety of metformin use in type 2 diabetic pregnancy.68–70There are studies which have used metformin during pregnancy in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, without any noticeable adverse effects on the fetus.71There are few publications of its use in GDM, and these are dominated by the Metformin in Gestational Diabetes (MiG) Study.",0
"Interestingly fetal death and malformations were not a component of the primary outcome; however, 19 events in the metformin group were classified as serious fetal or neonatal adverse events (including 11 congenital anomalies) compared to 23 events in the insulin arm (including 18 congenital anomalies and one fetal death).",0
None of these events were adjudged by the data and safety monitoring committee to be treatment related and there were no serious adverse events associated with the use of metformin.,0
"Additionally, more women using metformin indicated that their treatment was acceptable compared to those on insulin.",0
"From these results, the authors have suggested that metformin is a safe and effective treatment for GDM.",0
Several small studies comparing metformin to insulin for the treatment of GDM have also been performed (Table 5).,0
"Two have concluded that metformin is as effective as insulin for glycemic control in GDM, and that it is safe.",0
"However, one study, a randomised controlled trial, was underpowered to realistically address the effectiveness and safety of metformin in GDM.73In another study, a retrospective case control study, subjects treated with insulin had a greater degree of initial glucose intolerance, so the comparison was of limited validity.74A third study comprised a retrospective cohort which included a mixture of both GDM and women with Type 2 diabetes seen from 1966–1991.",0
"It found an increase in stillbirth and perinatal mortality, as well as pre-eclampsia amongst those treated with metformin, compared to women treated with insulin or sulphonylureas.",0
"However, as there was no evaluation of glycemic control early in pregnancy, and more women on metformin had pre-existing type 2 diabetes, the groups do not appear to be well matched.",0
It is quite possible that the adverse findings in this study are due to more women in the metformin group having a greater severity of hyperglycemia early in the pregnancy.,0
"Long-term concerns regarding glyburide and metformin therapy for GDM\nAlthough the above randomized trials have demonstrated non-inferiority of glyburide and metformin in achieving glycemic control, and satisfactory birth outcomes compared to insulin therapy, concerns must remain as long-term issues have not yet been addressed.",0
"Repeated episodes of GDM are associated with the earlier development of diabetes, and this has been postulated to be due to the increased stress that the β-cells are exposed to with each pregnancy.75By treating the mother with glyburide, it is possible that this accentuates β-cell stress and accelerates their decline, whereas insulin therapy would conversely provide a degree of relief to the β-cells.",0
"Therefore glyburide has the potential to result in earlier development of maternal diabetes, and long-term follow-up of the mothers are needed to alleviate this concern.",0
"In contradistinction, metformin reduces insulin resistance and hepatic gluconeogenesis, which theoretically would be beneficial for the preservation of β-cell function.",0
"In subjects with type 2 diabetes, the ADOPT Study has demonstrated that metformin is superior to glyburide in this regard.76As there is transplacental passage of metformin,77,78its effect on fetal insulin resistance might even provide further benefit in light of data of insulin resistance and insulin secretory defects in offspring of diabetic pregnancies.19However, any pharmacological agent which crosses the placenta must be viewed with caution as there always remains the possibility of unexpected long-term effects.",0
Metformin alters gene expression in mice livers and has been demonstrated to have an antiproliferative effect through reductions in cyclin D1 and activation of AMP kinase.79The programming and developmental effects of these on a fetus are unknown.,0
"Furthermore, metformin can promote the development of lactic acidosis, which surely must be a concern in situations of fetal distress.",0
"Whilst 18-month follow-up data on 126 offspring of women with polycystic ovary syndrome treated with metformin during pregnancy have not revealed any deficiencies in growth or motor-social development, this may be too short a time frame for potential programming effects of metformin to become evident.80\nIn view of the above concerns regarding the potential of glyburide and metformin to have long-term effects on the mother and child, I would recommend caution with their use in the treatment of GDM.",0
A subgroup of infants from the MIG Study are currently being followed up.72It may be circumspect to await the findings from this follow-up study before metformin can be considered safe for the routine treatment of GDM.,0
"Other oral antidiabetic agents for gestational diabetes\nThere is one study which randomized women with GDM to treatment with insulin, glyburide, or acarbose.61Forty two percent of the acarbose subjects failed to achieve adequate glycemic control and ultimately required insulin therapy.",0
"Whilst this study is inadequately powered to demonstrate safety of acarbose, it is not absorbed from the gut, and therefore would be unlikely to affect the fetus.",0
However it is of low potency and insulin therapy will often need to be introduced.,0
"Furthermore, the high frequency of gastrointestinal side effects experienced by people with type 2 diabetes suggests that any future role of acarbose, even if subsequent studies confirm safety, will be limited.",0
There are no studies using glitazones in pregnancy.,0
"Transplacental transfer occurs,67,81and until studies demonstrating safety are performed, they should be avoided in pregnancy.",0
"Evidence that treatment of gestational diabetes improves pregnancy outcomes\nThe strongest evidence that treatment of GDM is of benefit comes from the Australian Carbohydrate Intolerance Study (ACHOIS) in Pregnant Women.82In this randomized controlled trial, 1000 women fulfilling the 1985 WHO criteria for “gestational glucose intolerance” were recruited.",0
One other important finding of this study was that intensively treated women had better quality of life and lower rates of depression.,0
"Prior to ACHOIS, a large number of other studies had been performed to ascertain if treatment of GDM is of benefit.",0
"These studies were largely retrospective, unrandomized, or lacked power to detect differences in serious adverse perinatal outcomes and will not be listed here.",0
"However, one large retrospective cohort study of 116,303 pregnancies, merits discussion.",0
"It therefore seems likely that the decreased mortality rate was at least in part a consequence of treatment of GDM, rather than only to other improvements in obstetric outcome.",0
Post-partum management of gestational diabetes\nThe medical management of gestational diabetes should not conclude with the delivery of the fetus.,0
"Although hyperglycemia usually resolves with the conclusion of the pregnancy, women who have had GDM are at high risk of developing diabetes later in life.",0
"Apart from the development of diabetes, women who have had GDM have an adverse cardiac risk profile, including the metabolic syndrome.83,84A higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease that occurs at a younger age, independent of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes has also been demonstrated.83\nIn view of the above, it is important that the woman who has had GDM receive counseling and support to reduce her long-term risk of diabetes.",0
"Screening for diabetes, at regular intervals, is recommended by a number of diabetes societies.4,85This is important for the early diagnosis of diabetes, to facilitate the prevention of complications.",0
"Furthermore, if the woman is of reproductive age, the pre-pregnancy recognition of diabetes is vital so that early pregnancy conditions can be optimized to prevent diabetes fetopathy.",0
"Issues specific to pre-existing diabetes in pregnancy include tight glycemic control and adequate folate supplementation.53,54Additionally, post partum evaluation and management of reversible cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia should be undertaken.",0
"There is evidence that lifestyle modification, aiming for a 5%–7% reduction in body weight, is effective in preventing or delaying the development of diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance.",0
"Both the Diabetes Prevention Program86and the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study87demonstrated this, with an intensive intervention including lifestyle coaches, strict supervised exercise regimes and caloric restriction.",0
"As 15% of the women in the Diabetes Prevention Program and Diabetes Prevention Study had GDM, similar measures should be recommended to women after they have had GDM.",0
"However, it is unclear if less intensive interventions can be effective in this population.",0
"To date, small short-term studies focusing on dietary counseling alone, or a combination of behavioral strategies with weekly exercise classes, have not demonstrated an improvement in glucose tolerance.88,89In part, this is probably due to the real life challenges of maintaining motivation for healthy lifestyle change amongst young women at a time that they are having to deal with young children, return to work, and further education.",0
"Nonetheless, there are undisputed benefits to healthy eating and regular physical activity so these activities should be encouraged.",0
"Summary and conclusions\nGestational diabetes is a common disorder which in the majority of cases, should initially be managed by dietary measures.",0
Moderate physical activity should be encouraged.,0
Fasting and post-prandial glucose testing is necessary for monitoring and guidance of therapy.,0
"Where dietary measures are inadequate to achieve glycemic targets, insulin should be introduced.",0
"Insulin is still the mainstay of pharmacological treatment of GDM, and this is ideally administered in a basal bolus regimen.",0
"The rapid acting analogs lispro and aspart are considered safe, but the safety of the long-acting analogs are yet to be determined.",0
"Whilst there are studies demonstrating short-term safety of glyburide and metformin during pregnancy, I suggest that they be reserved for situations where implementation of insulin therapy is impractical or not possible.",0
"After all, we know that insulin therapy is safe and usually effective.",0
ACHOIS has shown that it is acceptable to the majority of women.,0
"By eschewing insulin, doctors may actually be treating their own perceived fear of injections, rather than providing the best therapy to the patient.",0
"Based on our current information, insulin is still the best option, with the least potential for long-term risk to the mother and child.",0
"With good medical and obstetric care, the risks to the pregnancy should be minimal.",0
"However, a woman with GDM is a woman at high risk of future diabetes.",0
"Therefore after the pregnancy, healthy lifestyle measures should be encouraged to minimize the likelihood of developing diabetes, and regular screening for diabetes should be undertaken.",0
"Early life nutrition, the developing immune system and subsequent allergic manifestations\nOver the last half-century, chronic disease incidence, including allergic manifestations (AM), has increased exponentially in developed nations and amongst the wealthy in developing nations.",0
"While diet can impact health at any life stage, it is likely to be most important during the fetal and infancy periods, when the immune system is immature.",0
"Based on an extensive review of the literature, we considered this hypothesis for the 3 nutritional progressions from fetal life through infancy: prenatal nutrition, breastfeeding and introduction of solid foods.",0
"While there is little conclusive evidence to support that a prudent diet is protective against AM especially after birth, modest evidence suggests that a prenatal maternal nutrition high in n-3 and micronutrients (e.g.",0
This indicates that there may be a window of opportunity during fetal development in which allergic manifestation risk may be altered.,0
The effect of breastfeeding on the prevention AM is unresolved.,0
"Despite this, exclusive breastfeeding to 4-6 months should be encouraged as human milk contains numerous immunological properties and is associated with other health benefits.",0
"If breastfeeding is not possible, hydrolyzed formulas seem to confer a greater protective effect than traditional formulas.",0
Solid foods should be introduced at age 4-6 months.,0
The order of introduction seems to have little effect on AM.,0
"At present, it is impossible to conclusively state that a particular dietary pattern or food will alter AM risk in infants.",0
"Dietary intake of fish, omega-3, omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin D and the prevalence of psychotic-like symptoms in a cohort of 33 000 women from the general population\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nLow intake of fish, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and vitamin D deficiency has been suggested to play a role in the development of schizophrenia.",0
"Our aim was to evaluate the association between the intake of different fish species, PUFA and vitamin D and the prevalence of psychotic-like symptoms in a population-based study among Swedish women.",0
The effect was most pronounced for omega-6 PUFAs.,0
The associations were J-shaped with the strongest reduced risk for an intermediate intake of fish or PUFA.,0
"For fatty fish (herring/mackerel, salmon-type fish), the strongest inverse association was found for an intermediate intake (RR: 0.81, 95% CI, 0.66-0.98), whereas a high intake of fatty fish was associated with an increased risk of psychotic-like symptoms (RR: 1.90, 95% CI, 1.34-2.70).",0
"Conclusion\nOur findings raise a possibility that adult women with a high intake of fish, omega-3 or omega-6 PUFA and vitamin D have a lower rate of psychotic-like symptoms.",0
"Background\nEven though psychoses are relatively rare, between 5-15% of the general population has been estimated to report single schizophrenia-like symptoms like delusions, magical thinking, and hearing internal voices at some point in their lifetime [1-3].",0
The biological mechanisms underlying the etiology of schizophrenia and psychotic symptoms are largely unknown.,0
"Genetic constitution is important [4], but environmental factors like an unhealthy lifestyle with a poor diet may be involved [5,6].",0
Schizophrenia in adulthood is often preceded by milder symptoms and delusions during adolescence.,0
Meta-analysis [8] and prospective follow-up studies indicates that up to 75-90% of developmental psychotic experiences are transitory.,0
Persistence and clinical relevant impairment may be related to a family history of schizophrenia and environmental risk factors that might interact with the genetic risk.,0
Self-reported psychotic experiences in the general population may represent the developmental expression of population genetic risk for psychosis [9].,0
"Low maternal fish and seafood consumption during pregnancy is reported to increase the risk for a low IQ and suboptimal neuro-developmental outcomes in childhood [10], factors that in turn are associated with an increased risk for adult mental disorders like schizophrenia [11].",0
A recent meta-analysis found a latitude related increase in schizophrenia prevalence that was greater for groups with low fish consumption [12].,0
"Fatty fish is a rich dietary source of essential fatty acids and vitamin D, both of which could be implicated in the development of schizophrenia.",0
"For instance, it has been proposed that aberration in metabolism of phospholipids could be a biochemical basis for psychiatric disorders [13].",0
"Although, only hypothesis generating, two ecological studies support the hypothesis by reporting the ratio of saturated fat to PUFA in the diet is a strong predictor of schizophrenia outcome, measured as according to either clinical or to social variables [6,14].",0
"Also, the dietary intake of PUFA was negatively correlated with the severity of psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia [15].",0
"Lower levels of PUFA have been found in brain content, red blood cells and skin fibroblast among patients with schizophrenia, compared with a healthy population [13,16].",0
"Results from a review of several randomized clinical trials of PUFA treatment of schizophrenia were inconclusive, although, it seems that supplementation of especially EPA to these patients may have a positive effect on their schizophrenic symptoms [17].",0
"Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that prenatal vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for schizophrenia, supported by the role of this vitamin in cell growth and differentiation, the excess of winter births in schizophrenia (a period when vitamin D levels are low), and increased births of pre-schizophrenic subjects in urban areas, where vitamin D deficiency is higher [12,18].",0
"However, to our knowledge, no study has investigated the association between dietary intake of fish, omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA or vitamin D and the risk of having positive psychotic symptoms in the general adult population.",0
"The main purpose of the present study was to evaluate the association between the dietary intake of different fish species, the dietary intake of PUFAs (omega-3 and omega-6) and vitamin D and the prevalence of positive psychotic-like symptoms in a population-based study among Swedish women.",0
"The CAPE tool has proven to be a stable, valid and reliable self-report instrument for the measurement of psychotic-like experiences in the general population based on cross-validation with interview-based data [24,25].",0
"We are aware that some arachidonic acid (AA) could be found in fish [27], however, we choose to include those fatty acids that are dominating in fatty fish into the variable ""marine fatty acids"".",0
"However, we were not able take environmental factors and geographic area into account, because the study questionnaire did not assess the origin of fish, such as the Baltic Sea or the Atlantic Ocean.",0
"The category ""low level symptoms group"" (no psychotic-like symptoms) was used as the reference group.",0
"Since, the outcome status (namely psychotic symptoms) among participants was unknown at study entry we cannot draw any conclusions about causality, only about the existence of associations (negative or positive).",0
"Based on the hypothesis under study we interpreted the RR<1 as a negative association (for simplicity we refer to it from now on ""decreased risk"") and RR>1 as a positive association (for simplicity we refer to it from now on as ""increased risk"").",0
The selection of covariates included in the final multivariate models was based on proportional (≥10%) change in β-coefficients and previous subject matter knowledge.,0
"We initially tested all covariates, and those included in the final models were considered to be important confounding factors for the relation between the main exposure and psychotic-like symptoms.",0
We decided not to include dietary Vitamin D estimates in the final multivariate models as fish is a rich source of vitamin D and could account for some of the effect of fish on our outcome.,0
"Additionally, there is a high correlation between vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids (correlation = 0.77).",0
"Women in the high level group were more likely to be never drinkers than women in the low level group, the multivariate RR, adjusted for smoking, BMI, education and country of birth, was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-1.8).",0
The remaining dietary intake of different food items and specific nutrients were similar among the three groups of women with different levels of positive psychotic-like symptoms (Table1).,0
"However, there was a J-shaped association between psychotic-like symptoms and fatty fish (herring/mackerel and salmon-type fish) with the strongest inverse association for intermediate dietary intake (RR: 0.81, 95% CI, 0.66-0.98), whereas a high intake (RR: 1.90, 95% CI, 1.34-2.70) of fatty fish was associated with an increased risk of high level psychotic-like symptoms.",0
"In the high level symptoms group compared with the low level symptoms group, the intake of shellfish 1-3 times per month was associated with a reduced risk, whereas the intake of shellfish more than three times per week was associated with an increased risk.",0
The latter result did not remain significant after multivariate adjustment (Table2).,0

"We found support for a protective effect regarding the risk of positive psychotic-like symptoms with high dietary intake of fish, omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA, as well as of vitamin D. The associations were J-shaped with the strongest reduced risk for an intermediate intake of fish or PUFA.",0
Our findings provide further support for the hypothesis that an aberration in lipid metabolism may be involved in the biochemical basis for psychiatric disorders [13].,0
"This suggestion has earlier been supported by ecological studies showing that variations in schizophrenia outcome between countries may be due to differences in the diet [6,14].",0
Further evidence for the hypothesis that PUFA is involved in the etiology of psychiatric disease has been put forward through the study by Stokes et al.,0
"showing a negative correlation between dietary PUFA intake and the severity of psychotic symptoms [15], as well as studies showing that patients with schizophrenia or depression have lower levels of PUFAs in brain tissue, red blood cells and skin fibroblasts and with a low intake of fish and PUFAs [16,29-31].",0
"Finally, supplementation of PUFA, especially EPA, has been reported to be of possible benefit for patients with schizophrenia [17].",0
No earlier studies that we are aware of have evaluated the relationship between adult vitamin D levels and psychotic symptoms.,0
Our findings indicated a protective effect of vitamin D for the risk of psychotic-like symptoms.,0
Prenatal vitamin D deficiency has been proposed to be a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia [12].,0
"Results from the Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort showed that vitamin D supplementation during the first year of life was associated with a reduced risk of schizophrenia in males, but not in women [32].",0
"However, a small pilot study of maternal vitamin D levels in archived prenatal sera, showed no decrease in prenatal vitamin D in subjects who later developed schizophrenia [33].",0
It has been hypothesised that vitamin D insufficiency could account for some of the increased risk of schizophrenia observed among dark-skinned immigrants moving to countries with less sun exposure [12].,0
"Our results of a protective effect of vitamin D intake must be considered as rough, since we only measure the dietary intake of vitamin D. A more complete picture of the vitamin D status could have been supplied through vitamin D levels in blood; however, no biological samples are available.",0
"The absorption of dietary vitamin D is generally high at all stages of life [34], but serum levels also depend on the endogenous production of vitamin D due to sun exposure which is subject to seasonal variations.",0
"Thus, the correlation between vitamin D intake and serum levels may vary.",0
"However, Burgaz et al.",0
recently reported that 2-3 weekly servings of fatty fish increased 25(OH)D by 45% in a population of Swedish women [35].,0
"Our results of the protective effect of fatty fish could in part be due to the content of vitamin D. While the epidemiological evidence linking low prenatal vitamin D and schizophrenia remains inconclusive, rodent models have provided compelling evidence about the role of vitamin D deficiency for brain development like larger lateral volumes [36], subtle memory dysfunction and altered attention processing [37] which have implications for neuropsychiatric disorders.",0
"Unexpectedly, the intake of fatty fish (salmon, herring and mackerel) or shellfish more than twice a week increased the risk of being in the group with the highest level of psychotic-like symptoms.",0
This puzzling finding may be due to unknown or known unhealthy constituents of fatty fish.,0
"For instance, environmental pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and dioxins are known to accumulate in fatty fish [38].",0
Another possible explanation may be that the frequent intake of fish and PUFA may be advantageous in lower doses but disadvantageous in higher doses.,0
and Peet & Horrobin suggest that there might be such a therapeutic window for DHA and EPA regarding their protective role for schizophrenia or depression [39-41].,0
Significant higher levels of DHA have been found in red cell membranes of un-medicated schizophrenic patients compared to healthy control subjects [42].,0
"Furthermore, our findings of a more pronounced protective effect of omega-6 fatty acids than for omega-3 fatty acid are in agreement with the results from an EPA supplementation study in schizophrenia presented by Horrobins et al.",0
"This study surprisingly found that the effect of intermediate doses of EPA increased the levels of AA (an omega-6 PUFA) in the membrane of red cells, whereas higher doses of EPA did not, and the EPA-induced rise in AA was associated with a clinical improvement.",0
The respective biological effects of omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids on the etiology of psychiatric symptoms could very well differ and the balance between the intakes of these fatty acids might be of importance.,0
"It has been proposed that the ratio of omega-3:omega-6 fatty acids might be more important in inhibiting the development of several diseases, including cancer, inflammatory and heart diseases [45,46].",0
"We find no support for this in our results, since, the effect of omega-3:omega-6 fatty acids on psychotic-like symptoms were almost similar to those of omega-3 fatty acids.",0
"However, the mechanisms of action and protective abilities of PUFA could differ between different diseases.",0
The non-linearity in the association might seemingly argue against a possible causal relationship.,0
"However, the associations with dietary components and health are often non-linear with advantageous effects of a balanced nutrition [47-50].",0
We have no baseline measure of symptom levels to further elucidate causality between different levels of intake of fatty fish or shellfish and the risk of positive psychotic-like symptoms.,0
"However, keeping the prevalence figures for psychotic disorders in mind, rather few participants in our population sample are likely to have a disorder, which may diminish the problem of reversed causality related to psychotic diagnosis or medication.",0
"In our study, the definition of psychotic-like symptoms was based on self-reported frequency of psychosis-like experiences.",0
"The classification of women into three groups with different levels of symptoms (low, middle and high) was based on predefined, but arbitrary cut-offs from the self-reported answers to the CAPE questionnaire.",0
We acknowledge the limitation that the scale have not been used earlier in Sweden and validated in the Swedish population.,0
These characteristics are often seen in patients with psychotic disorders [51-53].,0
"Based on the sum population prevalence of schizophrenia and other psychoses in middle-aged women [54], we might expect that 2-3% of the study participants would cross the boundaries to clinically valid syndromes.",0
"The CAPE measures of psychosis are strongly correlated with measures of general psychopathology, including depression.",0
"The association between the positive and the depressive dimension in CAPE, which we unfortunately could not include for practical reasons, is fairly low when distress associated with positive symptoms is held constant (r = 0.25; Stefanis et al., 2002 [1]).",0
"Thus, there are reasons to believe that the dimension of positive symptoms is an independent dimension.",0
In terms of generalisability of our results it is relevant to compare the levels of dietary intake of PUFAs and vitamin D in our cohort to other populations.,0
The contribution of dietary intakes of PUFAs to total dietary fat is comparable to other Western cohorts [55].,0
"The quotient omega-6 PUFA/omega-3 PUFA was 4:1 in this study, and this value is comparable to other European cohorts [56,57], but lower than that has been reported for US populations (Food and Nutrition Board.",0
The dietary intake of vitamin D in this cohort is comparable to several other European populations [58].,0
It is relevant to note that in Sweden low-fat dairy products and margarines are fortified with vitamin D. Otherwise the dietary intake of vitamin D would be lower.,0
"Furthermore, men were not included in the study and there is gender difference in the prevalence of psychosis [59].",0
However psychotic-like experiences in the general population might be more equally distributed among women and men [60].,0
The strengths of our study include its thorough diet data design and large sample size.,0
"The ethnic homogeneity of our study population reduces the risk of confounding by unmeasured factors, both genetic and environmental.",0
"We were able to adjust for smoking, BMI, migration, education and alcohol that could confound our associations between diet and psychotic-like symptoms.",0
"We had no information about socioeconomic status, but the adjustment for education, which is strongly associated with socioeconomic status, did not change the estimates.",0
"Still, we cannot rule out that there are unknown confounders that we have not been adjusted for, for example drugs influencing levels of serum lipids or family history of psychiatric illness.",0
"If the proportion of non-urbanized participants was high in the study population this could have confounded our results, nevertheless this is not the case in the Swedish population.",0
"Misclassification of fish and PUFA or vitamin D intake due to measurement error associated with the food frequency questionnaire is unavoidable, but given the study design likely non-differential, and thus attenuating any true association.",0
It is also relevant to note that Hibbeln et al.,0
"reported high correlations (r = 0.7) between the dietary intake of EPA and DHA and serum levels of EPA and DHA in subjects with schizophrenia [51], indicating a good ability to report dietary intake accurately.",0
"An important limitation of this study is that we measured dietary intake only once, involving misclassification among those who changed their dietary pattern during follow-up.",0
"However, again some misclassification of dietary intake cannot be ruled out, such a misclassification is likely to be non-differential, and attenuating any true association.",0
"Unfortunately, we do not have information about specific vitamin D supplementation.",0
"But, adjustment for multivitamin supplement intake, containing vitamin D, did not change the estimates.",0
"Unfortunately, we do not have any information about the use of such supplements during follow-up.",0
"However, according to national figures from the National Food Administration, a low number of Swedish women took fish oil supplements (1%) at the time of the study.",0
"The drop-outs had a slightly higher BMI, lower education and were more often smokers and born outside of the Nordic countries.",0
"However, our main exposure (fish/fatty acids) did not differ between those who participated and those who did not participate in the study.",0
"Conclusions\nIn conclusion, in this large-scale cohort of Swedish women we found that a frequent consumption of fish, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids appears to reduce the risk of positive psychotic-like symptoms.",0
"The associations for fatty fish or shellfish were J-shaped, with the strongest inverse association for an intermediate dietary intake, whereas a high intake was associated with a higher rate of high level psychotic-like symptoms.",0
"Interestingly, we found a lower rate of psychotic-like symptoms with increasing vitamin D intake.",0
Future studies are warranted for replication and should evaluate if this is a causal relationship.,0
There are no current studies that can give real good answers to the question if dietary deficiency interacts with genetic vulnerability for schizophrenia.,0
Schizophrenia is a multifactorial disorder with strong genetic vulnerability and the vulnerability might include metabolic aberrations.,0
"Further, it would be of interest to study if dietary aspects are associated with separable latent dimensions of positive psychotic-like symptoms and if the associations are valid for men and for other age groups.",0
"Season of Birth and Risk for Adult Onset Glioma\n\nAbstract\nAdult onset glioma is a rare cancer which occurs more frequently in Caucasians than African Americans, and in men than women.",0
The etiology of this disease is largely unknown.,0
"Exposure to ionizing radiation is the only well established environmental risk factor, and this factor explains only a small percentage of cases.",0
Several recent studies have reported an association between season of birth and glioma risk.,0
"This paper reviews the plausibility of evidence focusing on the seasonal interrelation of farming, allergies, viruses, vitamin D, diet, birth weight, and handedness.",0
"To date, a convincing explanation for the occurrence of adult gliomas decades after a seasonal exposure at birth remains elusive.",0
"Despite considerable efforts to unravel the etiologic basis for this cancer and attempts to find a cure, gliomas largely remain refractory to treatment.",0
"However, the attributable risk for these factors is small and can only explain a fraction of cases.",0
Evidence of an association between adult-onset glioma and date of birth suggests an etiologic role for a seasonally variable environmental exposure occurring prenatally around the time of birth.,0
"Similarly, exposure to asbestos 70 years prior to the development of mesothelioma [4], suggests a “one insult, co-carcinogenic model” of cancer development [5].",0
"Risk factors that may exhibit seasonal epidemicity include exposure to infectious agents, allergens, pesticides, indoor environmental tobacco smoke, and other sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., soot from fires for home heating), and use of antihistamines.",0
"Other putative candidates include harmonic variation in population mixing, diet, temperature, humidity, sunlight/photoperiod, levels of vitamin D3, and endogenous hormones [6,7].",0
The origins of many childhood and adult malignancies are believed to be determined during a finite perinatal window.,0
"During this period the brain and immune systems are less developed, undergoing greater cell growth and differentiation, and possibly more susceptible to DNA and epigenetic changes underlying cancer development in the near or distant future [5,8–13].",0
"In this model, environmental exposures and lifestyle changes that occur afterwards play a mainly secondary role to the programming or imprinting that occurs during pregnancy and/or early infancy [14,15].",0
"Review of Literature\nSeveral recent studies have explored season of birth as a risk factor for adult glioma, but results have been mixed (Table 1).",0
"Three independent reports have observed a peak risk for winter births [16–18], while no seasonal variation for risk was noted in two other epidemiologic studies [19,20].",0
"A multi-centered study of four Midwest states examining rural and farm exposures observed a statistically significant increased risk of adult gliomas for springtime births, but only among those born “off” a farm [21].",0
"Similarly, the study of childhood brain tumors and season of birth have yielded equivocal results [22–26].",0
Risk Factors Related To Season of Birth\nThe underlying rationale for the occurrence of a glioma decades after a seasonal exposure remains elusive.,0
No specific etiologic agent to date has been identified to support such a long induction period for this cancer.,0
"Several hypothetical arguments have been offered in explanation of a season of birth effect for adult gliomas, if such an association exists.",0
"Thus far, the major evidence in support of a seasonal effect involves farming, allergies/immunity, viruses, and vitamin D. Other possible factors related to seasonal birth are diet, birth weight, and handedness.",0
"Many farm chemicals are classified as probable or likely human carcinogens by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), most notably acephate, dichlorvos, dimethoate, lindane, parathion, phosmet, and tetrachlorvinphos [28].",0
"Household dust concentrations of azinphosmethyl, chlorpyrifos, parathion, and phosmet have been found to be significantly higher in farmer or farmworker homes than in referent homes [29].",0
"Homes with high pet activities have been shown to have greater levels of pesticide residues in sampled carpet dust than homes with low pet activities [31,32].",0
"In tandem with living on a farm, infants have unique vulnerabilities that may lead to higher levels of exposures in the same environment than adults [9].",0
"Dryness, rashes, and related skin conditions, to which infants may be particularly susceptible, serve to disrupt the protective barrier of the skin [36,38].",0
"(Pesticides also are used outside the farm in urban schools, homes, and day-care centers for control of roaches, rats, and other vermin, and conceivably their peak period of application may differ seasonally from that on farms [33,40].)",0
"While farmers live longer than the population-at-large [41], and die less frequently from cancer in general [42], several epidemiologic studies have found an increased risk for brain cancer in this group [43–50].",0
"Farmers represent a diverse group (e.g., with dairy, field crop, hog, beef cattle, poultry, fish, marijuana, cotton, and organic), and the heterogeneity of brain cancer risk for farmers could reflect differences in activities, as well as in the type, magnitude, and seasonality of exposures.",0
"Within this window the peak for immune system priming or susceptibility is believed to vary differentially in response to presenting antigens [53,54].",0
"Contact with allergens during early childhood may enhance the risk of developing allergies later in life, especially in individuals with a predisposition for atopic and allergic conditions [51,55].",0
"Efforts to reduce allergen exposure immediately after birth often only delay the onset of allergic conditions, rather than preventing it, suggesting that immunologic memory may predate birth [15].",0
"While genetics constitute a key determinant of immunologic memory and immune system maturation [56–58], environmental factors also are believed to play an important role in the development of allergies, as illustrated by the discordance of allergies in twin studies [59], the increasing prevalence of atopic diseases over time [15,60], and the different incidence of allergies in immigrant and country of origin populations [61].",0
"In a number of studies, season of birth has been associated with the development of allergic conditions later in life, such as asthma [61–65], atopic dermatitis [66], house dust mite allergy [60,61,65,67–69], cockroach allergy [70,71], grass/birch/hay and other pollen allergy [51,60,63,67,68,72–76], animal dander allergy [51,67], mold allergy [74], food allergy [51,55,67], allergic rhinitis [62,77], and otherwise unspecified atopy (NOS) [55,78].",0
"Factors known to influence the development of asthma include race [80,81], low yearly family income [81], less than a high school education [81], residence in high poverty areas [81], exposure to urban air pollution [64] and childhood viral infections [64,82].",0
"Asthma, allergies, and other atopic diseases have been inversely associated with adult glioma risk in several epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses [83–93], although some reports do not support this conclusion [94–98].",0
The exact biologic mechanisms underlying a protective effect are not clearly understood.,0
"It has been suggested that the inverse association may reflect increased immune surveillance on the part of the atopic individual [91,93].",0
"Glioma patients are known to suffer from an impaired immune system [99], and the reduced association with allergies alternatively could be due to immunosuppression induced by the tumor ( i.e ., reverse causality) [84].",0
Inflammatory responses also may favor tumor development [93].,0
"Being raised on a farm [102–114] or in a rural area [115] has been shown in some studies to protect against asthma, hay fever, and atopic sensitization.",0
"Although farm children are exposed to higher concentrations of airborne allergens, paradoxically they become sensitized less often and manifest a weaker sensitization response than non-farm controls [113].",0
Some researchers have hypothesized that the protective effect may be attributed to a form of “tolerance”.,0
"Such tolerance could conceivably develop early in life, following repeated exposure to high levels of allergens such as organic dusts, fungi, and endotoxins; this is perhaps the result of component lipopolysaccharides that excite Th1 responses and suppress the development of immunoglobulin-E (IgE)-antibodies [109,116].",0
Little is known about specific determinants of asthma and atopy in the farm setting.,0
"Any relationship with glioma risk is probably complex and must be interpreted in light of differences in farming practices and the protective ability of farming environments, especially with respect to microbial exposures [102,103,114].",0
"While farmers and their families have greater contact with seasonal elements, they may be less prone to “sick building syndrome” than residents of urban areas [117].",0
"Other mitigating factors may include a greater intake of saturated fat in the form of milk and butter, as well as a greater number of older siblings living at home in rural/farm communities [116].",0
"Furthermore, farmers usually are non-smokers and healthier than the population-at-large [43,116,118–120].",0
"By self-selection, those who manifest seasonal allergies may choose a career path other than farming (i.e., healthy worker effect) [116].",0
"Differences in the definition of atopy, a lack of objective measures of atopy, residual confounding, and bias (e.g., detection, selection, interview, recall) are important to consider when interpreting the above studies [92,121].",0
"Furthermore, regarding the role of allergies and immunity, there is no clear trend toward a decreasing risk for glioma with younger ages at onset of the allergic condition [121].",0
"Interestingly, increased risk for glioma has been observed in patients with AIDS-related immuno-suppression [122–124], but not in those with iatrogenic immuno-suppression [125].",0
"Viruses\nEnvironmental exposures to viruses, microbes and other pathogens generally tend to occur more often in particular seasons [25,126,127].",0
Polyomaviruses have been shown to induce brain tumors in animals [128–131] and have been detected in human gliomas [132].,0
Other neuro-oncogenic viruses implicated in gliomas under laboratory conditions include human adenovirus type 12 and Rous sarcoma virus [133].,0
"Some tumor viruses must be injected in animals on the first day of life to be effective, although they may not cause cancer until years later [7].",0
Epidemiologic evidence in support of a viral or pathogenic etiology for adult brain tumors remains controversial and the windows of interest of these studies have been outside the perinatal period.,0
"In adults, Toxoplasma gondii infection has been associated with a greater prevalence of astrocytomas [134], while decreased glioma risk has been associated with a history of infections/colds [88], and chicken pox [135,136].",0
"On the other hand, increased risk for childhood brain tumors has been associated in some studies with a history of chicken pox [137], influenza [138,139], measles [138], general viral infections [140,141], and neonatal urinary tract infections [141].",0
Bacterial urinary tract infections have been shown to follow a well defined seasonal pattern with a peak in August [127].,0
"Similarly, seasonal occurrence has been observed for chicken pox, measles, influenza and many other common childhood infectious diseases [7,142].",0
A seasonal infectious etiology for disease is complicated by many factors [126].,0
The same infectious agent may present a different pattern of incidence depending on the host location.,0
A seasonal peak evident in the general population may not behave uniformly within certain subpopulations.,0
"Temperature, humidity, precipitation, and indoor air quality are among the mitigating factors that may affect the survival and transmissibility of a pathogen and explain different seasonal peaks for a disease in different studies.",0
"Furthermore, seasonal variation in immune function may increase host susceptibility to infections at certain times of the year [143,144].",0
"Given the rarity of some infections and brain tumors, the interpretability of seasonal patterns, or the lack thereof, may be confounded by time- and/or space-dependent factors [126].",0
"Maternal serum vitamin D levels tend to be closely correlated with infant cord serum levels [146,147].",0
"This light synthesized steroid, resulting from the absorption of ultraviolet B photons by 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin [148], has been suggested as a possible factor underlying the season of birth risk for adult gliomas observed in some studies [145].",0
"Levels of vitamin D are known to fluctuate depending on sunlight exposure, which is highest in the summer for the northern hemisphere and tends to increase for latitudes nearer the equator [145,148–150].",0
"Antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity of vitamin D3 has been noted in model glioma cell lines and a primary culture, as well as tumor tissue experiments [145].",0
"Further, prenatal vitamin D3 depletion has been associated with altered brain development in rodent studies [151].",0
"Vitamin D receptors are present in most cells and tissues in the body [152], including the brain [148], so this hormone is believed to play an important role in disease management and cancer prevention as a modulator of immune system activity [148,153–155].",0
"Children who live in polluted, inner city environments and who are deprived of regular sunlight exposure have been shown to suffer a higher prevalence of rickets (due to vitamin D deficiency) than children in rural areas [148].",0
"Seasonal variation in vitamin D levels also has been suggested as a factor differentially affecting newborn growth plate width, and this may explain why babies born in Australia around October (spring) are relatively heavier than those born at other times [156].",0
Diet\nThe “developmental plasticity hypothesis” refers to the critical developmental period in utero when the fetus is plastic and adaptively imprints to its environment.,0
"In utero adaptation may lead to lifelong changes in the body’s metabolism, hormone regulation, and the number of cells present in key organs [14,157,158].",0
"If this is the case, adult health outcomes may reflect season of birth if food intake is seasonal, and if exposure occurs at a critical stage of fetal development.",0
Foods high in N-nitroso compounds have been associated with an increased risk for brain tumors in some studies [162–165].,0
These compounds may be present in foods through their use as preservatives or in fertilizers [166].,0
"An 18-fold greater risk of primary adult brain tumors has been found among individuals who consumed large amounts of processed meats (high in N-nitroso content) and drank orange/grapefruit juice once per week or less, than among those who consumed less processed meat and drank orange/grapefruit juice more often [164].",0
"However, a recent multi-centered international case-control study of adult diet and brain tumor risk found no evidence of confounding or effect modification by vitamin supplementation, especially in the association between consumption of cured meats (containing high levels of nitrates) and gliomas [167].",0
"High birth weight is an important predictor of adult obesity [171], and a higher body mass index (BMI) has been linked to greater risk for adult-onset glioma [172].",0
"In children, high birth weight has been associated with increased risk for astrocytoma and medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) [173].",0
Temporal patterns in birth weight may result from seasonal variations in food availability.,0
"Interestingly, very low birth weight has been associated with left- or mix-handedness [175,176], a factor associated in some studies with season of birth [177] and reduced glioma risk [178].",0
"Handedness\nHandedness is believed to be determined in utero [179], possibly through hormonal influences [180–183], and has been linked with immune disease [184,185], various developmental learning disorders [184], epilepsy [186], and breast cancer risk in both pre- and post-menopausal women [187–190].",0
"Exposure to a high level of testosterone during the earlier part of pregnancy is thought to promote right brain development and influence hand preference, although the evidence in support of a relationship is not conclusive [191].",0
"Testosterone, progesterone, oestradiol, and lutenising hormone levels in women have been reported to be higher in spring than in autumn [192–194].",0
Results from several studies hint that non-genetic factors may play an important role in the determination of handedness.,0
"Similarly, left-handedness has been linked to congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a condition characterized by high in utero levels of androgeizing hormones [197].",0
"Of note, brain tumors are known to contain sex steroid receptors (e.g., estrogen, androgen, progestin) [198], and sex hormones have been shown to promote brain tumors in animal studies [199,200].",0
"Mice reared under conditions favoring the right limb develop a right-limb preference, and vice versa [201], further suggesting that environmental factors influence handedness.",0
"Additionally, the discordance of handedness in twin studies illustrates that genetics alone cannot explain the development of handedness [202–207].",0
Being right-handed has been associated with a greater risk for glioma than being left-handed or ambidextrous [178].,0
"However, for left-handed and ambidextrous participants born from late fall through early spring, glioma risk also has been shown to be higher than for those born at other times of the year [16].",0
"A study of 15,390 Brazilian students was unable to detect a difference in the season of birth between right- and left-handers.",0
"The putative connection between handedness, season of birth, and glioma risk remains difficult to interpret.",0
"For example, glioma risk is greater for males than females [2], yet the pattern of seasonal influence upon handedness does not vary significantly between females and males [177].",0
A higher incidence of sinistrality has been observed for individuals born in winter and autumn than for those born summer and spring [191].,0
"The incidence of left-handedness is disproportionately higher among males [202], a finding which is consistently observed across species [201,209–212].",0
"Overall, handedness appears to be a surrogate marker for an underlying but unidentified risk factor that interacts with seasonality and other factors to possibly explain glioma risk.",0
Discussion\nSeason of birth in its own right cannot be deemed a cause for glioma.,0
"Rather, it is a surrogate marker for underlying risk factors that may offer subtle clues about the possible perinatal etiology of adult gliomas.",0
There is probably no specific etiologic agent acting in isolation that completely explains a season of birth association with adult glioma risk.,0
"If an association exists the effect probably represents the interplay between various environmental, genetic, lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors, operating on mother and child within a precise window of vulnerability.",0
The mechanism of action may involve epigenetic processes or DNA changes with the capacity to modulate or influence oncogenic outcomes in the distant future.,0
"A patient’s innate and adaptive immune response and a host of hormonal and metabolic factors, likely play important and closely interrelated roles in understanding the complex biologic and etiologic mechanisms in the season of birth effect for adult gliomas.",0
"In the studies conducted to date, risk estimates and p-values for the association between season of birth and glioma risk have been nominal to borderline in strength.",0
"However, a weak association does not necessarily imply the absence of causality, nor is a strong association necessary or sufficient for causality [213,214].",0
The ability to find associations between specific seasonal risk factors occurring around the time of birth and adult glioma incidence is limited by the rarity of this cancer in the population and the vast time period from exposure to disease.,0
"While the risk factors outlined in this review do not conflict with our current understanding of the natural history of cancer or glioma specifically, the evidence in support of a causal relationship has not been consistent.",0
"To some degree, effect modification or publication bias may explain the inconsistencies.",0
"At minimum, if a causal relationship exists, season of birth meets the criteria of temporality as the period surrounding birth clearly predates disease occurrence.",0
"However, the exact window of exposure when the underlying risk factor(s) most occur to cause disease is unknown.",0
"On the present evidence, it is not possible to definitively answer the question of how season of birth influences glioma risk, or to favor any specific hypothesis.",0
"Many questions remain and future research will benefit from focused studies aimed at specific exposures and subpopulations, allowing for more detailed analyses by histologic subtypes.",0
Asthma and Allergic Diseases in Pregnancy: A Review\n\nAbstract\nAsthma and allergic disorders can affect the course and outcome of pregnancy.,0
Pregnancy itself may also affect the course of asthma and related diseases.,0
Optimal management of these disorders during pregnancy is vital to ensure the welfare of the mother and the baby.,0
Specific pharmacological agents for treatment of asthma or allergic diseases must be cautiously selected and are discussed here with respect to safety considerations in pregnancy.,0
"Although most drugs do not harm the fetus, this knowledge is incomplete.",0
Any drug may carry a small risk that must be balanced against the benefits of keeping the mother and baby healthy.,0
"The goals and principles of management for acute and chronic asthma, rhinitis, and dermatologic disorders are the same during pregnancy as those for asthma in the general population.",0
"[""Diagnosis of allergy during pregnancy should mainly consist of the patient's history and in vitro testing.""]",0
"The assured and well-evaluated risk factors revealed for sensitization in mother and child are very limited, to date, and include alcohol consumption, exposure to tobacco smoke, maternal diet and diet of the newborn, drug usage, and insufficient exposure to environmental bacteria.",0
"Consequently, the recommendations for primary and secondary preventive measures are also very limited in number and verification.",0
"Allergies or hyperreactivities have been classified by Gells and Coombs into types I through IV, with types I, II, and III being mediated by antibodies or immune complexes and type IV reactions as well as chronic stages of allergic diseases being mediated by T cells [1].",0
The focus of this review is set on asthma and type I allergy associated with pregnancy.,0
Cross-linking is more likely if the allergen occurs in dimerized or multimerized form [3].,0
Immediate-phase type I allergic symptoms usually occur within several minutes after allergen contact.,0
"The newly synthesized cytokines and chemokines lead to the late-phase reaction associated with tissue edema by recruitment and activation of additional inflammatory cells, including basophils, eosinophils, and T helper type 2 (Th2) lymphocytes [6].",0
Part 1: Specific Allergic Diseases in Pregnancy\n\nEpidemiology: Prevalence of Asthma and Allergy in Pregnant Women\nAllergic sensitization to common allergens can be detected in approximately 25% to 35% of the general population in industrialized countries [7].,0
"Other allergic diseases that may complicate pregnancy include conjunctivitis, acute urticaria, anaphylaxis, food allergy, and drug allergy.",0
Asthma and allergic disorders can affect the course and outcome of the pregnancy.,0
Pregnancy itself may also affect the course of asthma and other diseases [10].,0
Optimal management of these disorders during pregnancy is vital to ensure the welfare of the mother and the baby.,0
Specific pharmacological agents for treatment of asthma or allergic diseases must be cautiously selected.,0
"Although most drugs do not harm the fetus, this knowledge is incomplete.",0
Any drug may carry a small risk that must be balanced against the benefits of keeping the mother and baby healthy.,0
"Safety of Asthma and Allergy Medication in Pregnancy\nThe ideal situation during pregnancy is ""no pharmacological therapy,"" especially during the first trimester.",0
"However, the reality is that medications must be considered for pregnant patients with medical disorders, based on a thorough appreciation of the potential deleterious effects of untreated disease.",0
"For instance, women with asthma or allergic diseases require drug therapy during pregnancy to prevent symptoms severe enough to be life threatening to the mother or the fetus (eg, severe acute asthma that can result in hypoxia).",0
"Of the available medications for allergic rhinitis (AR), chlorpheniramine is recommended as the first-generation antihistamine of choice for use during pregnancy [11].",0
"Based on the information available (Table1), loratadine or cetirizine may be considered the second-generation antihistamines of choice.",0
The decision whether to use a first-generation or second-generation antihistamine for a particular patient must be individualized.,0
"Caption (TABLE-WRAP): TABLE 1\n\nRecommendations for Treatment of Asthma and Allergies in PregnancyDrugs preferred for use during pregnancy\u2003Anti-inflammatory: cromolyn beclomethasone, prednisone\u2003Bronchodilator: inhaled β2-adrenergic agonist, theophylline\u2003Antihistamine: chlorpheniramine, tripelennamine\u2003Decongestant: pseudoephedrine, oxymetazoline\u2003Cough: guaifenesin, dextromethorphan\u2003Antibiotic: amoxicillinDrugs that generally should be avoided during pregnancy\u2003α-Adrenergic compounds (other than pseudoephedrine)\u2003Epinephrine (other than for anaphylaxis)\u2003Iodides\u2003Sulfonamides (in late pregnancy)\u2003Tetracyclines\u2003Quinolones\nAdapted from the NAEPP expert group report [21].",0
"Although most of the existing data regarding asthma and allergy medications during pregnancy have not demonstrated adverse effects, data regarding the use of oral corticosteroids have not been totally reassuring.",0
"In a recently published meta-analysis,[12] 6 cohort studies evaluating the relationship between first trimester maternal use of oral corticosteroids and congenital malformations did not show an increased risk of congenital malformations (summary odds ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.08-2.60).",0
"However, meta-analysis of the 4 case-control studies revealed a significantly increased risk of oral clefts in infants of corticosteroid-treated mothers (odds ratio, 3.35; confidence interval 1.97-5.69) [12].",0
"Other adverse outcomes have also been attributed to oral corticosteroids, including an increased risk of preeclampsia,[13,14] preterm birth,[12,15] and lower birth weight [16].",0
"However, the potential side effects of any drug must be balanced against the risks of the mother or the infant having inadequately treated disease.",0
"In the case of asthma, the risk of uncontrolled severe asthma (which may include maternal or fetal mortality) would usually be the greater risk, suggesting that oral corticosteroids must still be used when indicated for the management of severe gestational asthma.",0
These alterations are primarily the result of hormonal effects.,0
They could potentially affect the course of asthma and predispose to hypoxia.,0
"Preexisting asthma symptoms may worsen, improve, or remain unchanged during pregnancy.",0
Each of these 3 possibilities are observed in about one third of all cases [10].,0
Caption (FIG): FIGURE 1\n\nPotential side effects of any drug taken during pregnancy by the mother must be balanced againts the risk of the mother of the infant suffering from inadequately treated symptoms .,0
"In general, patients with severe asthma are more likely to experience worsening of their disease during pregnancy.",0
"Alterations in maternal immunity, particularly a decrease in cell-mediated immunity, may predispose the pregnant asthmatic to infections and thus to acute exacerbations of asthma.",0
"Severe or poorly controlled asthma may be associated with an increased risk of fetal death, low birth weight, congenital malformations,[18] and parental complications [14].",0
Pregnant patients with severe or uncontrolled asthma should be considered high-risk and be treated promptly and optimally to ensure a favorable outcome for mother and baby.,0
"Thus, optimal asthma treatment is crucial, as the risk of preeclampsia, premature birth, low birth weight,[19] and maternal and neonatal hypoxia and morbidity [10,20] posed by undertreated asthma may be greater than that from the use of oral steroids for the treatment of asthma.",0
"Management of Chronic Asthma\nThe goals of management during pregnancy are the same as those for asthma in general, including prevention of severe exacerbations, improvement of quality of life (no interference with sleep or daily activities), and maintenance of normal lung function.",0
Frequent regular follow-up visits to or by health professionals skilled in managing asthma are essential to ensure optimal success and safety of asthma management during pregnancy.,0
"The importance of effective 3-way communication among the patient, asthma specialist, and obstetrician cannot be overemphasized.",0
Patients should have easy access to their physicians during times of increased symptoms.,0
The recommendations for medical treatment have been summarized by a Working Group of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program in a report on managing asthma during pregnancy [21].,0
"A stepwise approach is suggested for medical treatment, where inhaled salbutamol is the preferred short-acting β agonist with an outstanding safety profile, and inhaled corticosteroids (eg, budesonide) should be used confidently as long-term control medications.",0
Salmeterol is the preferred agent when long-acting β2 agonists are indicated in pregnant women as add-on treatment of persistent asthma.,0
Leukotriene modifiers may be used as alternative add-on treatment; montelukast and zafirlukast are the preferred antileukotriene drugs (but zileuton is not).,0
Patients whose asthma is not controlled with maximal doses of bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents may need systemic corticosteroids.,0
The lowest possible effective dose (alternate-day dose or single daily dose) should be used.,0
"Patients must be monitored closely for potential adverse effects of corticosteroids, especially gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth retardation.",0
"Management of Acute Asthma\nTreatment of acute asthma is similar to that recommended for nonpregnant patients including inhaled β2agonists, oxygen (essential), and corticosteroids (oral or parenteral) [22].",0
It is also reasonable to add nebulized ipratropium bromide in patients who do not respond to β2agonists.,0
Intravenous aminophylline is not generally recommended in the emergency management of acute asthma (because of its potentially harmful effects) but may be used in pregnant patients hospitalized for acute asthma (theophylline levels should be monitored).,0
Criteria for admission and hospital management of the pregnant woman with acute asthma should be more lenient than for nonpregnant patients.,0
Intravenous magnesium sulfate may be beneficial in acute severe asthma as an adjunct to inhaled β2agonists and corticosteroids.,0
Pregnancy-associated hormones have direct and indirect effects on nasal blood flow and mucous glands.,0
Allergic rhinitis is often preexisting but may occur or be recognized for the first time during pregnancy.,0
"As with asthma, preexisting AR can worsen, improve, or remain unchanged during pregnancy [27].",0
"Furthermore, during pregnancy, nasal congestion can worsen, although the exact mechanism for this is not defined.",0
"The general principles of treatment of pregnant women with asthma [21,22,28] and AR [29] do not differ from the stepwise approach recommended for treatment of nonpregnant women.",0
"Intranasal cromolyn, intranasal steroids, and montelukast are the preferred drugs for the treatment of rhinitis because of the low risk of systemic effects.",0
"Second-generation antihistamines such as loratadine or cetirizine [21,29] can also be used (after the first trimester--as a general precaution).",0
"Anaphylaxis\nThe exact prevalence of anaphylaxis during pregnancy is unknown, but it is extremely uncommon [30].",0
The fetus seems to be relatively protected from anaphylaxis perhaps because the placenta does not transmit specific IgE antibodies to the fetus [31].,0
"However, maternal hypoxia or hypotension associated with anaphylaxis may be catastrophic not only to the mother but also to her fetus.",0
"Maternal anaphylaxis has been associated with fetal distress, brain injury, and fetal loss (presumably because of diminished uteroplacental perfusion), as well as neonatal death [32-35].",0
Any agent that can cause anaphylaxis in the nonpregnant state could also cause anaphylaxis in the susceptible or sensitized pregnant patient.,0
Even breast-feeding has been associated with anaphylaxis in 2 postpartum women.,0
Changing levels of progesterone and triggering by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were suggested as potential causes [36].,0
"Of the routine antianaphylaxis medications, epinephrine and diphenhydramine have been implicated in causing fetal malformations.",0
"However, the tentative nature of these data and the lack of equally effective substitutes justify their use in pregnancy for this life-threatening emergency.",0
Adequate intravascular volume repletion and oxygenation are particularly important in the management of anaphylaxis during pregnancy to prevent both maternal and fetal complications.,0
The pregnant hypotensive patient should be placed on her left side to prevent added positional hypotension resulting from compression of the inferior vena cava by the gravid uterus [37].,0
Intravenous epinephrine may be required despite its potential to cause decreased uteroplacental blood flow.,0
Glucocorticoids should be administered early to patients with severe anaphylaxis.,0
"For laryngeal spasm, intubation and, in rare cases, tracheotomy may be necessary.",0
Adverse Reactions to Food\nNo studies have focused explicitly on the prevalence of food allergy in pregnant women primarily because often the immune response in the offspring is the main focus of research.,0
"A cohort study on the Isle of Wight, United Kingdom, found adverse reactions to food in approximately 20% of 969 pregnant women [38].",0
"From murine studies, it may be expected that the sensitization of a mother to a (food) allergen will also bias the immune response of the offspring toward Th2 [39,40].",0
"However, the exact prevalence of allergic forms of dermatitis in the pregnant population is not known.",0
"The importance of an exacerbation of eczema and dermatitis during pregnancy should not be underestimated as readout of the atopic state, being of interest for the genetic predisposition of the newborn [42].",0
The course is variable [43].,0
"Treatment of atopic dermatitis during pregnancy should emphasize avoidance of triggering factors and reliance on topical treatment in an attempt to reduce dryness and pruritus, modulate inflammation, and treat secondary infections.",0
"Oral antihistamines should be avoided during the first trimester, unless definitely clinically indicated, and then should be used at the lowest effective dose, starting with chlorpheniramine, loratadine, or cetirizine.",0
"Topical steroids should be selected based on potency considerations, given the potential for systemic absorption and increased skin surface area of pregnancy.",0
Severe intrauterine growth retardation occurred in the infant of a mother who applied 40 mg/d of topical triamcinolone cream from week 12 to 29 of gestation to treat her atopic dermatitis [44].,0
"Topical corticosteroid treatment should be initiated when clinically indicated, with the least potent preparations such as hydrocortisone (0.5% to 1%), reserving more potent preparations for more recalcitrant areas in selected patients.",0
"The recently introduced topical calcineurin inhibitors (pimecrolimus and tacrolimus), although effective in the treatment of atopic eczema, are not recommended for use in pregnant patients because of the lack of safety data.",0
Urticaria and Angioedema\nThe pattern and causes of urticaria and angioedema in pregnancy are similar to those in nonpregnant patients.,0
"A unique form of urticaria associated with pregnancy, which tends to recur in subsequent pregnancies ( pregnancy urticaria ), has been reported [45].",0
"The pathogenesis of this condition is unknown, although there is speculation that it may be caused by allergic sensitization to endogenous hormones [46,47].",0
"Antihistamines should be avoided if possible, but if required, chlorpheniramine, loratadine, or cetirizine may be used.",0
"Rarely, systemic corticoids may be used for severe recalcitrant urticaria and angioedema during pregnancy.",0
Drug Allergy\nThere is a lack of data on the prevalence of adverse drug reactions during pregnancy.,0
Diagnosis of Allergy During Pregnancy\nThe diagnosis of allergy in pregnant women should focus on a detailed medical history and symptom analysis.,0
"For diagnosis, a diary of allergy symptoms and avoidance of specific allergens accompanied by monitoring of changes of allergic symptoms may be helpful.",0
"However, it is important not to put the mother on a rigid elimination diet because this could negatively influence the nutrition of both the mother and the growing infant [48].",0
"In vitro diagnostic tools such as serological testing, for example, radioallergosorbent test for type I allergy or the lymphocyte transformation test for type IV allergy [49] are preferred to in vivo testing.",0
"Although not contraindicated, skin prick testing should be postponed until after birth because of possible, although rare, anaphylactic reactions to skin prick testing.",0
Only in situations where in vitro diagnosis is not conclusive and the mother is at risk for developing allergy symptoms should in vivo skin tests be used.,0
"Importantly, when performing in vivo testing such as skin tests or provocation test, the exceptional immunologic status accompanying pregnancy should be considered when interpreting test results.",0
Any unexpected test result and any symptoms that change over time should be reevaluated after pregnancy.,0
"In addition, the attending physician should bear in mind that some symptoms may be a direct result of pregnancy and not allergy related, for example, vasomotor rhinitis in the last trimester [51] and gestational urticaria (pruritic urticarial papules and plaques in pregnancy) [52].",0
"Nonpharmacological Management of Allergic Diseases During Pregnancy\nMothers with diagnosed allergy should avoid exposure to and contact with specific allergens (including food allergens) and should especially avoid the inhalation of potent triggers for asthma, such as animal dander, house dust, tobacco smoke, and irritating pollutants [22].",0
"Hyposensitization (immunotherapy), which may be selectively indicated in certain patients with AR, bee venom sensitivity, and asthma should not be initiated during pregnancy because of the risk of systemic reactions.",0
"For patients who were already on immunotherapy before the pregnancy, maintenance treatment may be continued safely during pregnancy.",0
"However, the allergen dose should not be increased during pregnancy but rather reduced if necessary [29].",0
"[""Allergy diagnosis during pregnancy should preferentially consist of recording the patient's history for precise recommendation of allergen avoidance and in vitro testing only.""]",0
"In vivo testing should generally be postponed until after pregnancy, unless diagnosis for therapeutic intervention is urgently needed.",0
Immunotherapy may be continued as maintenance treatment but should not be initiated during pregnancy.,0
Part 2: Prevention of Asthma and Allergies in Early Life\n\nInfants With High-Risk of Allergy\nThe potential risk for the development of atopy among newborns is high.,0
Genetic components and complex environmental factors contribute to the etiology of asthma and atopic diseases.,0
"To date, there are no biomarkers that can reliably predict which newborn will develop atopy.",0
"However, an atopic family history has been recognized to be a simple and inexpensive risk indicator.",0
"The degree of risk seems to be directly related to the family history of allergy and especially to maternal atopy,[53] particularly when the mother has diagnosed atopic eczema and has elevated IgE levels.",0
"The influence of maternal sensitization on the immune response of newborns was recently shown in a human observational study of AR, in which only the organ-specific symptoms of the mother but not the father were demonstrated to be relevant for the imprinting of the child [55].",0
"However, sensitization may not be restricted to the organ at which the mother experiences allergic symptoms because asthma or wheezing in children was associated not only with asthma and AR, but also with eczema or any allergic disease in their parents and siblings [56,57].",0
Transfer Mechanisms of Allergy (Immunopathogenesis of Atopy)\nThe allergic status of the mother can potentially affect the immune response of the offspring through numerous factors that are transferable via the placenta or breast milk.,0
The direct transfer of food or inhalant allergens via the placenta or breast milk has long been recognized [58-60].,0
"In addition, antibodies can be transferred to the child via placenta (IgG, IgA) or breast milk (IgA, IgG, IgM, IgE),[61,62] and even a transamniotic transfer of intact maternal IgE into the amniotic fluid can occur [63].",0
Only a very limited number of human studies on the maternofetal transfer of cytokines and chemokines are available.,0
The transfer of maternal cytokines was confirmed in a study of suckling piglets [65].,0
In vivo and in vitro models have shown that such transfer may lead to reduced neonatal immunity.,0
"Also chemokines, for example, IL-8, a cytokine that is regulated on activation with normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), IFN-γ -inducible protein 10, and monokine induced by IFN-γ have been detected in breast milk [66,67].",0
"However, cytokines and other soluble inflammation markers are found in breast milk from atopic as well as in nonatopic women.",0
"Another factor that should be considered is the composition of fatty acids present in breast milk, which may influence the immune response of the child [68].",0
This seems to be important because allergen-specific T cells transferred from 1 mouse mother to another can transmit asthma risk to the offspring of the recipient mouse mother [69].,0
Trafficking of cells could therefore be responsible for the passing of allergy risk from mother to fetus.,0
Environmental Risk Factors for Atopy\nThe causes of allergy in general and of specific sensitization in newborns in particular have not yet been completely determined.,0
"Besides the role of genetic predisposition, some factors have been identified that may either contribute to sensitization of the mother and to the subsequent transfer of a predisposition for allergy to the offspring, or that directly induce sensitization in offspring that manifests shortly after birth or at a young age.",0
Exposure to Tobacco Smoke\nOne of the most frequently discussed risk factors for induction of sensitization in all populations and age groups is tobacco smoke (active smoking or the passive environmental exposure).,0
"In a recent mouse study, exposure to smoke in utero induced a higher risk of sensitization against allergens in adult age in the offspring [70].",0
"Accordingly, in human blood samples, Th2 cytokines responsible for a predisposition toward allergy were elevated in the neonates only of mothers who had smoked during pregnancy [71].",0
"Alarmingly, in the birth cohort study from the Isle of Wight, about 43% of children had been exposed to environmental tobacco smoke during their first year of life [38].",0
Alcohol Consumption\nAlcohol consumption by the mother during pregnancy is associated with higher total IgE levels in cord blood [76].,0
Maternal Diet\nThe maternal dietary component consumed during gestation could influence the immune status of the child.,0
"For instance, different polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been shown to differently influence the outcome of eczema in the child.",0
"A diet higher in n-6 PUFAs--as present, for example, in margarine and vegetable oils--seems to be more likely to induce eczema than n-3 PUFAs, which are for instance found in fish [79].",0
"Accordingly, another study showed that fish consumption decreased eczema [80].",0
"However, it may not be the absolute content but the ratio of n-6 to n-3 PUFAs that may influence the development of either tolerance or sensitization to food, as a high ratio of 9 of n-6/n-3 in the diet of the mother prevented the induction of oral tolerance to ovalbumin in the offspring in a rat study [81].",0
"Celery and citrus fruits seem to increase the risk of food sensitization, whereas vegetable oils, raw sweet pepper, and again citrus fruit increase sensitization to respiratory antigens [79].",0
"Interestingly, apples consumed during pregnancy were able to decrease wheezing in children [80].",0
"According to a directive of the Commission of European Communities from 2005, the most allergenic foods have to be labeled because of their potency of eliciting severe allergic reactions: these are crustacean, fish, nuts, milk, egg, wheat/gluten, peanuts, soy, sesame, mustard, and celery.",0
It has long been proposed that the mother should avoid such foods containing potential allergens during pregnancy and lactation to prevent food sensitization in the child.,0
"However, recent studies suggest that allergen exposure may be necessary to induce tolerance, and moreover, a balanced diet prevents malnutrition of both mother and child [82].",0
"Furthermore, alterations of the maternal diet, that is, avoidance of milk and egg consumption during pregnancy did not seem to lower the risk of sensitization in the child [83,84].",0
"Studies found that about 70% of pregnant women are affected by these symptoms during their last trimenon,[85] and 50% of them are likely to take acid-suppressing medication.",0
"However, recent animal and human studies indicate that acid suppression and the resulting elevated pH in the stomach may lead to an increased risk of sensitization to food [86,87].",0
This sensitization of the mother was shown to lead to an increased risk of food allergy in the newborn in a BALB/c mouse model [39].,0
"As previously discussed, an allergic status of the mother has the potency to affect the immune response of the offspring by numerous factors transferable via placenta or breast milk and even via the transamniotic route, for instance, intact maternal IgE in amniotic fluid, maternal DNA in cord blood, leukocytes, and chemokines such as IL-8, RANTES, interferon-γ-inducible protein 10, or monokine induced by IFN-γ, allergens, as well as antibodies.",0
"Furthermore, the offspring of sensitized mothers are prone to experience suppression and a later onset of normal levels of the Th1 cytokine IFN-γ because of a lower frequency of IFN-γ-producing cells, and therefore a further bias toward a Th2 immune response.",0
"[""Infant's Diet\nRegarding the nutrition of the baby, reduced breast-feeding and early introduction of solid food have been discussed as confounders to allergy development.""]",0
"However, a randomized trial revealed quite contrary that promoted and prolonged (exclusive) breast-feeding is not able to prevent development of allergy or asthma in children at the age of about 6 years [88].",0
"In addition, a systematic review of several studies found no clear negative association between early solid food introduction and the development of asthma, food allergy, AR, or animal dander allergy [89].",0
"The impact of these 2 factors for sensitization to other allergens, such as aeroallergens, has not been investigated.",0
"However, 1 study showed that adolescents who had been born prematurely had a substantially decreased expiratory volume and increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness, making them potential candidates for developing asthma [91].",0
"Birth by Cesarean Delivery\nThe delivery of a baby by cesarean delivery has been suggested to be associated with increased risk of allergies and atopic diseases in the child, most probably because of a lower bacterial exposure for the child.",0
"In a recent population-based cohort study in Norway, it was shown that a positive association exists for cesarean delivery and risk of asthma in the child (especially when the cesarean delivery was performed because of an emergency in contrast to a planned section) [92].",0
"Bager and colleagues [93,94] also showed an increased risk for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and possibly for food allergies in their meta-analysis.",0
"However, because of the low numbers of an allergic outcome associated to cesarean delivery (only 1%-4%), the authors concluded that the epidemic increase of allergic diseases might not be attributable to the increased numbers of cesarean delivery.",0
Insufficient Exposure to Environmental Bacteria\nThe hygiene hypothesis states that low exposure of the mother during pregnancy and of the newborn in early life to environmental bacteria contributes to a Th2-biased immune response.,0
This hypothesis has been confirmed by several experimental animal and epidemiological human studies (reviewed in Renz et al [95]).,0
"Preventive Measures for Mother and Child\nStrategies for prevention of atopic diseases may be categorized as primary, secondary, and tertiary.",0
Primary prevention has been suggested for those newborns who have at least 1 parent or sibling with proven atopy.,0
"However, it must be borne in mind that a proportion of children who develop atopic manifestations in the first years of life come from families in which neither parents nor siblings are atopic.",0
"This suggests the possibility that some infants who would never have developed atopy would undergo preventive regimens, whereas others who become symptomatic in early life would not have received adequate advice.",0
Preventive pharmacotherapy and immunotherapy will not be discussed.,0
Smoking\nMaternal smoking and passive exposure to smoke should both be avoided.,0
"This is especially important for pregnant asthmatic patients, in whom smoking-related morbidity is independent of--and adds to--the morbidity resulting from asthma [96].",0
"Although there are contradicting epidemiological and experimental results regarding the direct influence of smoking on total and specific IgE production,[97,98] smoking should nevertheless be avoided for obvious reasons, such as carcinogenic smoke constituents and the vasoconstrictive effect of nicotine.",0
Alcohol\nAlcohol intake should be avoided by the pregnant mother because of well-known toxic effects on both mother and fetus.,0
"Moreover, alcohol consumption has been shown to induce higher IgE levels against aeroallergens in atopic patients [76].",0
"[""Maternal Diet During Pregnancy\nA Cochrane database meta-analysis of 4 clinical studies concluded that antigen avoidance during pregnancy is unlikely to reduce the child's risk of developing atopic disease, and dietary restrictions could adversely affect maternal or fetal nutrition [99].""]",0
"Although previously suggested that pregnant women with risks avoid peanuts, a subsequent study found no evidence of prenatal sensitization from maternal consumption of peanuts [100].",0
"In addition, recent publications revealed that an effect (positive or negative) of peanut avoidance on sensitization was not detectable (although too few valuable subjects and the observational nature of the reports reduce the ability to make firm conclusions) [101,102].",0
"Generally, there is a lack of evidence for maternal pregnancy restriction diets.",0
"Additional recent studies about pregnancy diets reveal that components other than specific allergens, such as fat, may influence atopy outcomes [103,104].",0
"Therefore, no special diet for the mother is required during pregnancy.",0
"On the contrary, the diet should be well balanced and consist of as many different nutrients as possible, as the current literature suggests that antigens obtained via the oral route during pregnancy and lactation are needed to develop allergen tolerance in the child [105].",0
"In line with this, there was no association between maternal intake of foods during pregnancy and the occurrence of asthma, respiratory disease, or allergy in 5-year-old children [80].",0
"Furthermore, many studies found no benefit of a restricted diet avoiding the consumption of allergy-inducing food during pregnancy [82].",0
"However, if the mother is already allergic or if there is a family history of atopy or allergy, food comprising potential allergens should be avoided.",0
"In such instances, the avoidance of peanuts, nuts, fish, eggs, and sesame during the last 3 months of pregnancy may have a protective effect [106].",0
"In this respect, government recommendations must be carefully worded, as 1 study found that avoidance of peanuts was overdone among pregnant women: although such avoidance was recommended only for women with atopy risk, 65% of all pregnant women had avoided peanuts during pregnancy (42% of all women who responded had heard about the advice, eg, from their midwives, and 50% subsequently changed their diet) [101].",0
"Numerous individual nutrients consumed by the mother during pregnancy have been suggested as being preventive for development of atopic diseases in the child; these include apples or fish,[80] vitamin D,[107] vitamin E,[108] and various probiotics, the latter having been shown to be effective in mouse models [109] and human studies [110].",0
"Antiacids During Pregnancy\nRecent studies have indicated that acid-suppressing medications can promote sensitization in adults [86,87].",0
"Therefore, it is suggested that antiacids should be taken only when prescribed by an attending physician to the childbearing mother.",0
"Treatment of reflux during pregnancy should focus on nonpharmacological measures, such as avoiding large meals shortly before bedtime, sleeping with the upper body elevated, and avoiding extensive consumption of coffee, sweets, and fatty foods.",0
"In addition, smoking is a cause of reflux and should be avoided.",0
"If these measures are unsuccessful, then prescription of antiacid drugs should be considered, for example, in the form of a step-up program beginning with antacids, and in case of failure with histamine-2 receptor antagonists, whereas proton pump inhibitors should only be used in women with intractable symptoms or complicated reflux disease [111,112].",0
"Avoidance of Other Allergens During Pregnancy\nAvoidance of other allergens is necessary only if the pregnant patients are already sensitized (eg, to cats, dogs, horses, or house dust).",0
"However, allergen avoidance may not be preventive or practical in all cohorts [113].",0
"Maternal Diet During Lactation\nRegarding maternal lactation diets, a Cochrane database meta-analysis [99] found some evidence of reduced atopic dermatitis, but suggested that more studies are needed.",0
A previous expert review that was not a structured meta-analysis and did not exclude as many studies as the Cochrane review concluded that special maternal lactation avoidance diets were unnecessary [114].,0
"During lactation, a special diet for the mother (or, if not breast-feeding, hypoallergenic formula nutrition for the infant) should be considered only in individuals with an established atopy risk or existing allergy [82,115].",0
"Diet of the Infants\nAs mentioned previously, for breast-feeding, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether it is more protective against allergies and asthma than bottle feeding because in a recent study, prolonged and exclusive breast-feeding could not decrease the rate of allergies or asthma in children [88].",0
"[""Furthermore, there are data supporting that breast-feeding should not be continued beyond 9 months of age because doing so seems to increase the child's risk for atopic diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and food hypersensitivity [116].""]",0
Some studies investigated the effect of reduced exposure of infants to allergen-provoking food.,0
"In cases where a reduced sensitization to food was found, this protective effect was short-lived and was primarily observed during the first year of life.",0
"[""As a further preventive measure, the early introduction of solid food (ie, baby food from jars and table food) into the infant's diet has to be revisited.""]",0
"It has been suggested that foods containing allergy-provoking proteins such as milk, egg, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and seafood should not be introduced into the diet of the child before the age of 6 months to 3 years [117].",0
"However, contact with and exposure to antigens may be necessary in early life to develop tolerance in the immune system [118].",0
"Thus far, studies on delayed introduction of solids led to conflicting results.",0
"Summary\nBased on currently available evidence, guidelines for primary and secondary prevention of allergic disease can be summarized as follows (Table3).",0
"Caption (TABLE-WRAP): TABLE 3\n\nPrimary Prevention of Asthma and Allergies in Early LifePreventive Measures \u2003Smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke should be avoided, especially during pregnancy and early childhood\u2003Alcohol consumption should be avoided by the mother during pregnancy and lactation\u2003Damp housing conditions should be avoided and indoor air pollutants reduced, especially for high-risk children (history of atopy or allergy in a first-degree relative)\u2003Breast-feeding should be performed exclusively until 6 months with no special diet for the lactating mother (except when the mother is already diagnosed with food allergy)\u2003Nonprescription drugs should be avoided during pregnancy and lactation unless recommended by a physician\n\nSmoking and Alcohol\nSmoking and passive exposure to cigarette smoke as well as alcohol consumption should be strictly avoided.",0
"Diet\nThere should be no special diet for the mother during pregnancy and lactation, unless the mother or child has a diagnosed food sensitization.",0
"[""In infants with risk of allergy, introduction of solid foods in general should be postponed until 6 months of age, milk products until 12 months, hen's egg until 24 months, and peanut, tree nuts, fish, and seafood until at least 36 months.""]",0
"Other Allergens\nAvoidance of allergens (pets, house dust, contact allergens, drugs) is not recommended except when sensitization has already been diagnosed.",0
Reflux Treatment\nPregnancy-associated reflux should be treated by nonpharmacological measures first.,0
"Atopy\nFor newborns at suspected risk for atopy, that is, with a history of atopy/allergy in a first-degree relative (parents, siblings), exposure to irritating air pollutants and airborne allergens such as molds should be minimized.",0
Breast-feeding\nInfants should be breast-fed for at least 4 months but no longer than 9 months.,0
"Special hypoallergenic formula (extensively hydrolyzed, not soy-based) should be used only if the child is diagnosed with atopy.",0
"Drugs\nAll nonprescription drugs (eg, antiacids) should be avoided during pregnancy and lactation unless recommended by a physician; patients should avoid intake of any medication including over-the-counter substances without consulting their physicians.",0
"Maternal Behaviors during Pregnancy Impact Offspring Obesity Risk\n\nAbstract\nThis study investigated the effects of maternal changes during pregnancy in diet, exercise, and psychosocial factors on offspring weight parameters at birth and 6 months.",0
"[""Mothers' eating behaviors during pregnancy, especially intake of sweets in OW/OB mothers, may have a lasting effect on child weight.""]",0
"Introduction\nRisk of obesity is shaped, in large part, by early life events starting during gestation.",0
"Studies have consistently found that higher maternal weight entering and during pregnancy increases risk for obesity among offspring in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood [1,2].",0
"While shared genes account for some of the similarity in maternal and offspring weight, evidence suggests that exposure to the uterine environment of an obese woman itself may directly program offspring obesity [3].",0
Both excessive [4] and inadequate [5] weight gain in the mother during gestation have been shown to lead to overly rapid fetal and infant growth rates and the programming of future risk of childhood overweight and metabolic disease.,0
"In the USA excessive GWG remains of predominant concern, as 60% of obese women gain more than recommended.",0
"Although maternal obesity and excessive GWG are both the result of energy intake exceeding energy expenditure, few studies have examined the specific influences of maternal dietary and exercise behaviors during pregnancy on offspring obesity risk.",0
Some evidence suggests that maternal prenatal intake of protein and fat [7–9] may be positively associated with birth weight.,0
"In animal models, prenatal exposures to overnutrition, high-fat and high-protein diets, “junk” food, and stress have been linked with greater adiposity in offspring [10–12].",0
"In nonpregnant humans, intake of soft drinks and junk food [13], higher dietary disinhibition [14], and restrictive dieting practices [15] have been positively correlated with overweight in children.",0
"However, little research has comprehensively examined the impact of maternal prenatal behaviors and psychosocial variables measured during pregnancy on subsequent offspring weight status at birth and 6 months.",0
This information is critical for the design of future intervention trials targeting obesity prevention in children.,0
"The primary aim of this study was to examine the impact of GWG, maternal eating and exercise behaviors, and psychosocial factors on offspring weight status.",0
"We hypothesized that offspring exposed to maternal obesity, excessive GWG, poor prenatal eating habits, less exercise in pregnancy, and greater maternal psychosocial distress during gestation would have higher weight for age (WFA) z -scores at birth and 6 months than nonexposed counterparts.",0
"Women ( n = 32) who developed gestational diabetes (GDM) were excluded from analysis a priori, given potential impact of GDM on both offspring and maternal weight gain [18].",0
"[""Overweight/Obese Mothers\nIn initial unadjusted analyses, several significant associations between overweight/obese mothers' prenatal behaviors and offspring WFA z -scores were observed (Table 2).""]",0
"Similarly, greater consumption of sweets early in pregnancy was significantly related to higher odds of macrosomia (OR = 1.1 (1.0, 1.2); P =\u2009\u20090.004) and WFA >90th percentile at birth (OR = 1.2 (1.1, 1.3); P =\u2009\u20090.002).",0
We examined GWG as an independent predictor and potential mediator of effects of maternal prenatal behaviors on offspring weight outcomes (Table 3).,0
"Examining GWG as a potential mediator, the effects of maternal prenatal behaviors on offspring weight outcomes were generally attenuated (i.e., P value increases between 0.01 and 0.06 across analyses) but not entirely removed when GWG was included in the models (Table 3).",0
"Normal Weight Mothers\nIn initial, unadjusted analyses, few significant correlations were found between prenatal behaviors and WFA z -scores at birth and 6 months in the offspring of normal weight mothers.",0
Only lower maternal fat intake (−0.22; P = 0.01) and trend for higher carbohydrate intake (0.16; P = 0.06) early in pregnancy were correlated with higher WFA z -scores at 6 months.,0
"Decreases in perceived stress during pregnancy were also independently related to higher odds of WFA >90th percentile (OR = 1.5 (1.1, 2.0); P =\u2009\u2009.01) but did not independently predict WFA z -scores at 6 months.",0
We also examined GWG as an independent predictor and potential mediator of effects of maternal prenatal behaviors on weight outcomes (Table 4).,0
"Examining GWG as a potential mediator, the effects of maternal prenatal behaviors on offspring weight outcomes were generally attenuated (Table 4).",0
"Discussion\nThis is one of the few studies to prospectively and simultaneously examine the impact of dietary, physical activity, and psychosocial parameters during pregnancy on the offspring weight status of overweight/obese and normal weight mothers.",0
"In obese mothers, we found that higher intake of sweets early in pregnancy was related to higher offspring weight status at birth and 6 months.",0
No prior studies have specifically examined impacts of maternal intake of sweets or soft drinks in pregnancy on offspring weight parameters.,0
"Our findings are consistent with some studies in nonpregnant adults and children showing a connection between higher intake of sweets and soft drinks and increased weight status [32], but conflicting results have been reported in association with GWG [33].",0
"Overall, the current study extends existing work by suggesting that exposure to foods or drinks high in sugar content early in gestation may predispose offspring to higher weight status early in infancy, independent of maternal GWG.",0
"In obese mothers, lower protein intake early in pregnancy and increased protein intakes over the course of the pregnancy were independently related to higher offspring weight at 6 months.",0
"Studies of protein intake in pregnancy have indicated that higher maternal protein intake was positively associated with birth weight [8,9], but there are notable exceptions [34,35] and most studies assessed diet later in gestation.",0
"Inverse associations between fat intake early in pregnancy and offspring weight have been reported previously [36], but not consistently [37].",0
"Nutritional effects on the fetus and mother may vary with prepregnancy body weight, trimester of exposure during pregnancy, and overall balance of macronutrients [8,38].",0
"Although a recent pilot randomized trial [39] found no significant impact of a low glycemic index diet on the offspring weight of overweight/obese mothers, future, larger randomized trials and research with more frequent assessments of diet in pregnancy are needed to untangle the relationship between weight status, time in pregnancy of nutrient exposures, and offspring weight outcomes.",0
"Surprisingly, physical activity and television viewing were not significantly related to offspring weight outcomes in normal weight or overweight/obese mothers.",0
"Also, increasing physical activity during pregnancy has been related to lower GWG in some [41] but not all [42] observational studies.",0
"Few clinical trial intervention studies have specifically measured changes in physical activity during pregnancy, but available evidence suggests little to no effect on maternal GWG [16,43].",0
Other research has found that a reduction in physical activity by bed rest was associated with an increase in infant birth weight [44].,0
"Overall, findings from the current study support a stronger role for maternal intake than expenditure in predicting offspring weight outcomes, but additional studies with objective measures of physical activity (e.g., accelerometry) are clearly needed.",0
"Increases in stress were related to lower offspring weight status in normal weight mothers (adjusted analyses) and overweight/obese mothers (unadjusted analyses), which is consistent with earlier research on stress in relation to inadequate GWG [45] and long-term offspring health [46].",0
"[""Overall, however, the current study's findings suggest that dietary variables may exert more of an effect than maternal psychosocial variables on offspring weight outcomes.""]",0
"Birth weight is an independent predictor of the development of obesity; however, increases in weight during the first 3–6 months of life are also influential on long-term increased risk of obesity [47,48].",0
Future research is needed to determine whether differences in postnatal feeding behaviors might explain differential growth rates in offspring of normal weight and overweight/obese mothers.,0
Excessive GWG was related to offspring weight but more strongly at birth than at 6 months and was not significantly related to changes in WFA z -scores.,0
"The association between GWG and offspring overweight may decrease as children grow older [49,50].",0
"Similarly, maternal prenatal behaviors may differentially impact birth and 6 months offspring weights (e.g., protein impacting 6 month but not birth weight in the current study).",0
"Interestingly, adjustment for GWG attenuated but generally did not completely remove the impact of dietary variables on offspring weight, particularly at 6 months.",0
This suggests that dietary exposures may impact offspring weight status above and beyond the potential influence of excessive GWG.,0
"Future research with more frequent assessments of offspring weight and, potentially, analysis of growth velocities [51] might better inform how and when nutrient exposures in pregnancy impact growth.",0
"This study is one of the first to prospectively examine impacts of prenatal diet, physical activity, and psychosocial exposures on offspring weight outcomes in a diverse sample.",0
"The sample was diverse but self-selected and free of diseases that might contraindicate participation in a lifestyle intervention study; thus, findings may not generalize to the population at large.",0
"A self-report, food frequency questionnaire was used, which is useful in ranking nutrient intakes of individual subjects but can be subject to bias, particularly in obese individuals [52].",0
"[""This study's focus was on predictors of large for gestational age at birth and 6 months, but future research is needed to examine predictors of small for gestational age, which may also predispose offspring to increased fat mass and incidence of metabolic syndrome as children and adults [53].""]",0
"[""Conclusions\nFindings from the current study indicate that excessive GWG and mothers' eating behaviors during pregnancy, especially intake of sweets in overweight/obese mothers, may influence offspring weight status early in infancy.""]",0
More research with larger sample sizes and frequent assessments of diet is needed to inform the impact of timing of nutrient exposures on offspring weight status.,0
"Also, future adequately powered randomized clinical trials are needed to determine whether modifying maternal prenatal behaviors and GWG can prevent offspring obesity.",0
"Identifying modifiable, prenatal causes of childhood obesity will inform future interventions targeting pregnancy as a “teachable moment” for primary and secondary obesity prevention.",0
"Effect on the incidence of pneumonia of vitamin D supplementation by quarterly bolus dose to infants in Kabul: a randomised controlled superiority trial\n\nAbstractSummary\n\nBackground\nVitamin D has a role in regulating immune function, and its deficiency is a suggested risk factor for childhood pneumonia.",0
Our aim was to assess whether oral supplementation of vitamin D3(cholecalciferol) will reduce the incidence and severity of pneumonia in a high-risk infant population.,0
"From 652 children during five separate periods of testing serum calcifediol, only one child in each of two testing periods had results greater than 375 nmol/L in the intervention group—a toxic level.",0
Introduction\nAfghanistan has the third highest mortality of children younger than 5 years in the world (257 per 1000 livebirths); a leading cause of this is pneumonia.,0
Two hospital-based case-control studies in Ethiopia1and India2suggest that vitamin D deficiency might substantially increase the risk of severe pneumonia in children.,0
Our systematic review identified one randomised placebo controlled trial3relating pneumonia or lower respiratory infections to vitamin D deficiency supplementation in young children.,0
"However, the risk of repeated pneumonia in the subsequent 3 months was 13% (relative risk [RR] 0·78, 95% CI 0·64–0·94; p=0·01) lower in the vitamin D3compared with the placebo group.3Other more recent studies assessing different outcomes in children or adults have conflicting findings on the effectiveness of vitamin D.\nThere is growing evidence of the vitamin D parancrine system enhancing innate immunity:4the activation of Toll-like receptors on monocytes and macrophages by microbial pathogens results in increased expression of CYP27B1 and vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) genes within these cells.",0
It has been suggested that vitamin D might be used in the treatment of opportunistic and antibiotic-resistant infections.,0
There is debate between investigators regarding concentrations that relate to optimum stores of vitamin D in the body.,0
"In children, serum calcifediol concentrations should be maintained at 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) or greater for skeletal benefits.6Vitamin D deficiency rickets in children younger than 5 years is an endemic problem in developing countries, ranging from 5–45%, even where sunlight is abundant,1,2,7,8and has also re-emerged in some developed countries.7,9\nIn people, the main source of vitamin D is through the action of ultraviolet B radiation on 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin, with small amounts derived from dietary sources.",0
"Therefore, breastmilk, a normally poor source of vitamin D,11becomes even more deficient.",0
"Furthermore, the common practice of swaddling infants might reduce exposure to sunlight.2Thus young children are at a high risk of vitamin D deficiency.",0
"A cross-sectional survey during the high-risk winter months in 2005 showed that greater than 95% of children younger than 5 years in a socioeconomically deprived part of Kabul had serum calcifediol levels of less than 37·5 nmol/L.12\nOn the basis of findings that vitamin D is an immunomodulator, that deficiency is a risk factor for pneumonia, and that quarterly supplementation had better compliance than daily or weekly supplementation,13,14we aimed to test the hypothesis that quarterly 100\u2008000 IU vitamin D supplementation would reduce the incidence of radiologically confirmed pneumonia by 35% in our study population.",0
"Our secondary hypotheses were that supplementation would reduce all pneumonias (radiologically confirmed or clinically defined), repeat episodes of pneumonia, hospital admissions, and all cause mortality.",0
"Procedures\nWe chose a quarterly supplementation regimen because in routine programme conditions a quarterly regimen is likely to have better adherence than a daily regimen,13,14and has been shown to be effective at maintaining the serum vitamin D concentration within normal ranges for 2–3 months in a French high-risk infant population.16The syringes containing vitamin D or placebo were stored in conditions recommended by the manufacturer—a dry cool environment—between 2 and 24 weeks before administration.",0
"Statistical analysis\nWe assumed that the incidence of the first or the only episode of pneumonia (first episode) in our placebo group would be 0·0585 per child per year based on the report that the incidence of acute lower respiratory infections in developing countries was greater than 0·65 per child per year,18that 12% of these episodes were pneumonia, and 75% were first episodes.",0
"Given that 73% of children had vitamin D deficiency in the study region in 2005,12and that the incidence of pneumonia was ten-times higher in vitamin D deficient children than in children without a deficiency in case-control studies1,2we postulated that there would be at least a 35% reduction in pneumonia incidence in the vitamin D compared with the placebo group.",0
To assess the potential problem of multicollinearity we used Pearsons correlation coefficient or Cramers V (for paired categorical variables).,0
We assessed violation of the proportionality assumption with Schoenfeld residuals.,0
"The difference was not statistically significant, although our study was not powered to detect differences in death rate.",0
"On intention-to-treat analysis, the incidence of the first episode of pneumonia was greater in the vitamin D rather than the placebo group, although this difference was not statistically significant (table 2).",0
"[""The mean serum calcifediol concentration was consistently and significantly higher in the vitamin D group than in the placebo group at 1 week, 4 weeks, and 3 months after administration of the first dose of vitamin D during the winter and at 2 weeks' post administration of dose 3 (spring;figure 3).""]",0
"The ascertainment of study outcomes was robust, and done clinically through masked experienced and retrained paediatricians with Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses clinical definitions of pneumonia applied in other trials18and radiologically through the interpretation of chest radiographs by masked, experienced, and external readers by use of WHO standards.",0
Thus the lack of a protective effect of vitamin D against pneumonia is probably not due to misclassification of outcomes or inadequate supplementation.,0
"Any misclassification of other causes of raised respiratory rate as pneumonia, under-reporting, or over-reporting would be distributed equally between the two groups since the families, doctors, radiographers, radiologists, and data entry staff were masked to the randomisation groupings and the randomisation was successful since the characteristics were balanced between the two groups.",0
"However, a limitation due to the high-risk nature of our population is that the generalisability of our findings to populations with low-to-moderate risk of vitamin deficiency is unknown.",0
"There were fewer deaths than we predicted in both groups, possibly due to the intense health surveillance possible during our study.",0
"Genotyping, which was not practical in our study setting, might have aided the interpretation of our findings, as shown in a vitamin D supplementation trial for tuberculosis.20\nWe accounted for nutritional factors through a diet questionnaire, weight at recruitment, and growth comparison at the end of our study—any nutritional deficiencies would have been equally balanced between the two groups.",0
"As with other studies, dietary calcium deficiency might have led to so-called wastage of body stores of vitamin D in both groups, affecting the maintenance of even higher vitamin D levels in the intervention group.",0
"Nevertheless, there was a higher (adequate level) mean serum concentration of calcifediol at the end of first supplementation period in the intervention group compared with the lower (not adequate) mean concentrations in the placebo group (data not shown).",0
"Furthermore, adult fracture-outcome supplementation studies21show no benefit from adding calcium.",0
A further limitation of our study is that it was not feasible to undertake biochemical assessment of the supplements or assess serum concentrations in all participants after each and between supplementation.,0
Our sample testing suggest that the vitamin D group maintained above mean adequate vitamin D concetrations verses consistently low concentrations in the placebo group.,0
It can be argued that a steady-state adequate vitamin D concentration was not reached in some children because of fluctuations in serum concentrations due to our study regimen.,0
"Although this is probably true, a sufficient serum concentrations for the immunological effects of vitamin D is unknown and could be higher or lower than that of the skeletal system accepted concentrations.6The need for a steady state is currently highly speculative and relates to vitamin D2supplementation for negative cancer22and bone outcomes.23\nOur findings are at odds with smaller case-control hospital studies that show an enhanced rate of vitamin D deficiency or rickets in children with pneumonia and the increasing evidence suggesting that calcitriol, the biologically active metabolite of vitamin D, has an important role in the human immune system.4A systematic review of the role of vitamin D supplementation in infectious diseases had mixed findings, concluding that more rigorously designed clinical trials are needed (panel).25No studies report the effect of vitamin D on radiologically confirmed pneumonias.",0
"Other trials assessing infections of the upper respiratory tract also had mixed findings: one trial in post-menopausal women26identified reduced self-reported episodes of infection of the upper respiratory tract, specifically in winter, whereas two others in elderly24and general adults27did not identify a difference between the groups with regards to self-reported episodes.",0
"One trial in schoolchildren28(measuring influenza A antigen from swabs) found a statistically significant reduced incidence in the intervention group (RR 0·58, 95% CI 0·34–0·99).",0
The benefits of supplementation for tuberculosis are similarly unclear.,0
"One paediatric trial showed 16% higher rates of tuberculosis symptom resolution,29an adult trial showed 23% greater sputum conversion rate at 6 months,30another trial showed 20% greater restriction of BCG-lux growth in blood,31another trial found accelerated sputum conversion only in a certain genotype of the sample,20whereas yet another found no significant difference in sputum conversion32in the intervention compared with the placebo group.",0
"Vitamin D is linked with other non-bone health outcomes, but the few completed and adequately powered trials assessing the effect of supplementation have mixed findings in improving outcomes—ie, cancers, vascular disease, and diabetes.",0
"As in our studies, these inconsistent findings point to the existence of complicated pathways for the function of vitamin D in disease processes, or simply that the correct effective dose of vitamin D supplementation needs to be better defined.",0
"The optimum concentrations of vitamin D for adults and children6are based on non-immunological and, mostly, bone outcomes.",0
"An associated issue is that, after the start of our trial, speculations arose that high fluctuations of natural or supplemented vitamin D intake might be linked to negative outcomes.",0
"These speculations relate two studies in which supplementation of a single large dose (300\u200800033or 500\u200800023IU) of vitamin D for reducing fractures in elderly women led to an increase in fractures, plus similar discrepancies in prostate cancer research with vitamin D.22Our findings and particularly the slightly higher repeat episodes of pneumonia in the vitamin D group could be due to such fluctuations if the hypothesis is true.",0
"If so, then in terms of policy and guidelines, it is hard to know what regimen to recommend for future trials, given that clinical practice and evidence suggests that daily or weekly supplementations though ideal are not complied with13,14and are impractical for families, especially in developing countries, and food fortification at the population level will not be an option during exclusive breastfeeding periods (aged <6 months), nor is it likely to be adequate in highly deficient populations.",0
"Alternately, it might be that immunological effectiveness of supplementation is highly dependent upon other factors as yet unidentified, or other prevalent factors in this high-risk population (for example, other malnutrition factors and that 5·5% of the children in our study had a Z score of weight for age below −3).",0
"Further questions arise with respect to the previous treatment trial in the same region of Kabul, which showed that a single high-dose supplementation with 100\u2008000 IU vitamin D3given orally to young children, along with antibiotic treatment at the time of diagnosis, reduced repeat episodes of pneumonia in the subsequent 3 months.3The inconsistent results could be related to the evidence that stimulation of Toll-like receptors on macrophages and monocytes by bacterial antigens is important in up-regulation of CYP27B1 and the vitamin D receptor,5which are crucial in production of cathelicidins in vitamin-D-depleted individuals.",0
"In other words, this system might not be effective unless there is existing infection with pathogens when vitamin D supplementation is given.",0
"Finally, any possible reduction in the incidence of pneumonia in our trial might be restricted to only certain genotypes as recorded in a single tt genotype after the start of our trial in a study of tuberculosis.20Both the pneumonia treatment and the population supplementation trials need to be repeated in other settings for confirmation, and frequent determination of serum calcifediol concentrations might guide the interpretation of the findings.",0
"As with the trials in the older children, giving higher doses of vitamin D,25,34we too did not record any adverse effects associated with vitamin D supplementation.",0
"However, the number of children and the length of follow-up involved in these studies could only detect common and early adverse effects.",0
"Although vitamin D overload is a theoretical possibility, 100\u2008000 IU of vitamin D3has been shown to provide the best protection against vitamin D deficiency without overload or side-effects in high-risk infants aged 0–9 months with normal baseline ranges of vitamin D.16Furthermore, single intramuscular injection of three times this dose (300\u2008000 IU) was safe in treating nutritional rickets in 6–30-month-old children residing in lower socioeconomic regions of sunny Istanbul.35Higher than recommended doses of daily supplementation of vitamin D (500–1000 IU per day, adding up to 120\u2008000 IU over 3 months) plus additional milk fortified with vitamin D, has been shown not to induce an overload,13including in infants starting with normal ranges of vitamin D, even when supplementation continued during the summer (in France) and when mothers had antenatal vitamin D supplementation.36It is important to note that in our study, where community supplementation was in a population with known high rates of vitamin D deficiency, 1% of children tested had a calcifediol concentration greater than 375 nmol/L—thought undesirably high.6Although these did not produce any clinical signs and symptoms, these measurements raise a need for caution with doses for population supplementation.",0
The speculative negative role of fluctuations is vitamin D needs to be considered with caution until further evidence is available.,0
We have shown that a quarterly 100\u2008000 IU supplementation of vitamin D3did not reduce the incidence of pneumonias in children living in regions with high vitamin D deficiency.,0
"In populations with similar characteristics, quarterly population level supplementation of vitamin D to infants and young children is not a policy option for reducing the burden of pneumonia in children.",0
Herb use among low income women at an urban tertiary care center and their communications with prenatal care providers\n\nPurpose\nLittle is known about the use of herbs in low income underserved mothers and patterns of communication about herb use to prenatal providers.,0
"We sought to examine these issues among women delivering at Boston Medical Center (BMC), an urban medical center serving many of the low income and underserved populations of Boston, Massachusetts.",0
"Methods\nWe interviewed women from the inpatient post-natal unit at BMC about what herbs they used during pregnancy, socioeconomic factors, changes to diet, and use of prenatal vitamins.",0
"We asked women if they discussed the use of herbs with their prenatal care provider, and how satisfied they were with these discussions; we asked the same questions about prenatal vitamin use for comparison.",0
We did not find any medical record documentation of a discussion about herb use.,0
"Conclusion\nIn this study 39% of women reported using herbs during pregnancy, a higher frequency than reported in other studies.",0
"It is important that providers be given the tools to empower them to discuss herbal medicine use with patients, and are encouraged to do so.",0
110\u2003Is Pet Ownership Associated with Higher Vitamin D?,0
"Abstract\n\nBackground\nPet keeping has been linked with decreased risk of allergic sensitization, which has been associated with the Hygiene Hypothesis; and more recently, by ourselves and others, to particular home microbiome patterns.",0
"Another factor possibly associated with pet ownership is increased Vitamin D among family members as pet keeping may be correlated with lifestyles involving increased outdoor exposure, such as dog walking.",0
Prenatal vitamin D inadequacy has been hypothesized as a risk factor for pediatric atopy and asthma.,0
"Methods\nTo investigate potential relationships between household pet exposure and cord blood vitamin D concentrations, we analyzed information from a large, geographically-based, general risk birth cohort.",0
"Because of notable differences in vitamin D concentrations between African Americans and Whites, analyses were stratified by race.",0
"For Whites, but not African Americans, having no pet compared to 1 or >1 pet during pregnancy was associated with lower cord blood vitamin D concentrations (37.7, 45.2, 47.0 nmol/L, respectively, P = 0.001).",0
"Considering type of pet, the relationship for no pet compared to 1 or >1 dog (37.7, 46.1, 49.9 nmol/L, respectively, P = 0.001) was similar to that for no pet versus 1 or >1 cat (37.7, 43.0, 46.5 nmol/L, respectively, P = 0.065).",0
"Conclusions\nIn a large ethnically diverse cohort of newborns, the presence of a pet in the home during the prenatal time period was associated with higher cord blood vitamin D, but only among Whites.",0
This racial difference may reflect an impact on pet owner behavior resulting in increased outdoor exposure that is limited to lighter skinned individuals.,0
"[""However, as the effect doesn't vary by cats versus dogs, differences by race in factors correlated with pet ownership or variations in pet keeping styles may be more important.""]",0
Vitamin D should be considered in studies of pets and atopic conditions.,0
Acute Type A Aortic Dissection in a 36-Week Pregnant Patient\n\nAbstract\nAortic dissection is a relatively rare yet often fatal condition.,0
Early recognition and treatment are crucial for survival.,0
"A review of the literature revealed a paucity of published cases describing the successful, emergent repair of acute type A aortic dissections in third- trimester gravid patients.",0
Introduction\nAortic dissection is a rare complication of pregnancy with significant morbidity and mortality for both the mother and infant.,0
"In the general population, aortic dissection has an estimated incidence of 2.9 per 100,000 person years [1].",0
Acute aortic dissection during the third trimester of pregnancy has been attributed to hemodynamic alterations that occur in late pregnancy.,0
"A high index of suspicion by the emergency physician in addition to successful coordination of care between the emergency physician, obstetrician, and cardiothoracic/vascular surgeon is necessary for a successful outcome.",0
We obtained a CT angiography of the chest due to our high index of suspicion for an acute aortic dissection.,0
Discussion\nAortic dissection is a rare complication of pregnancy with significant morbidity and mortality for both the mother and infant.,0
"A recent 2011 population-based study of acute type A aortic dissection in pregnancy revealed an overall incidence of 0.4 cases per 100,000 person-years and a prehospital mortality rate of 53% [2].",0
A longitudinal study over a period of 27 years discovered that aortic dissection was the initial clinical diagnosis in only 15% of patients presenting with an aortic dissection [1].,0
"While there are no firmly established practice guidelines, it has been suggested that before 28 weeks of gestation, aortic repair should proceed without cesarean section and after 32 weeks gestation, emergency cesarean section precede aortic repair [6].",0
"Between 28 and 32 weeks, the risks and benefits of early delivery should be considered.",0
"Although relatively rare, clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection in any pregnant female who presents with acute onset chest pain.",0
"Early recognition by the emergency physician in addition to successful coordination of care between the emergency physician, obstetrician, and cardiothoracic/vascular surgeon is necessary for a successful outcome.",0
"Gestational Diabetes Insipidus Associated with HELLP Syndrome: A Case Report\n\nAbstract\nGestational diabetes insipidus is a rare, but well recognized, complication of pregnancy.",0
It is related to excess vasopressinase enzyme activity which is metabolized in the liver.,0
"A high index of suspicion of gestational diabetes insipidus is required in a correct clinical setting especially in the presence of other risk factors such as preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, and twin pregnancies.",0
The newborn in this case also had hypernatremia thereby raising possibilities of vasopressinase crossing the placenta.,0
"Introduction\nGestational diabetes insipidus is a rare complication of pregnancy, and it is related to excess vasopressinase activity.",0
"Measurement of the vasopressinase serum concentrations is not available commercially, and the diagnosis is usually established based on the clinical presentation and the appropriate laboratory studies.",0
We are describing a unique case of gestational diabetes insipidus in a patient with HELLP syndrome.,0
"Discussion\nGestational diabetes insipidus is a rare complication of pregnancy that occurs in 4 out of 100,000 pregnancies as discussed by Durr [1].",0
"Symptoms usually develop over a few days and include polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue, nausea, weight loss, and decreased skin turgor.",0
Its pathophysiology is thought to result from increased degradation of arginine vasopressin (AVP) by a placental enzyme called vasopressinase.,0
The primary known action of vasopressinase is in vivo as well as in vitro degradation of vasopressin by removing amino acids from the N-terminus.,0
"Since the exogenous desmopressin is deaminated at the N-terminus, it can escape the degrading effect of the vasopressinase and is considered the treatment of choice in patients with gestational diabetes insipidus as demonstrated by Schrier [4].",0
"Vasopressinase is metabolized in the liver, which may explain higher concentrations of the enzyme in patients with fatty liver, hepatitis and preeclampsia as discussed by Barbey et al.",0
HELLP syndrome is considered a spectrum of preeclampsia.,0
"The pathophysiology is not well understood but has been hypothesized to result from excessive stimulation of V1 receptors by vasopressinase-altered AVP leading to platelet aggregation, vasospasm, endothelial constriction, and brain stimulation as discussed by Krege and Katz [6].",0
"On the other hand, liver dysfunction in patients with HELLP syndrome decreases the degradation of the vasopressinase as described by Ellidokuz et al.",0
"[""Therefore, it is possible that vasopressinase could have crossed the placenta thereby causing infant's hypernatremia and subsequently could have benefited from dDAVP.""]",0
"In light of the above case, we recommend maintaining a high index of suspicion of gestational diabetes insipidus in patients who present with typical symptoms and signs especially in the presence of other risk factors such as preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, and twin pregnancies.",0
"In addition, treating the infant with DDAVP besides intravenous fluids may also be beneficial.",0
"Translation of a gestational diabetes nutrition model of care into practice: results from an implementation project\n\nBackground\nReduced need for insulin therapy in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) has been documented in a study validating American Nutrition Practice Guidelines, which recommend at least 3 dietitian visits.",0
No Australian GDM Nutrition Practice Guidelines exist and systematic delivery of dietetic care to women with GDM does not occur in Australia.,0
This paper evaluates a theory-informed implementation plan to translate a dietetic model of care based on the American guidelines in an Australian maternity hospital.,0
Results\nBoth phases only ran for 7 months; integration required 4 months.,0
"Pre-intervention, only one of the 91 women with GDM seen received ≥ 1 dietetic follow-up appointment.",0
"However, due to heavy clinical demand, only 31.5 % of the 162 women seen after the change in practice received best-practice individual dietitian review at their first visit.",0
Clinically-relevant trends were seen in changes in medication requirements; the percentage of women requiring pharmacologic treatment decreased from 31.1% to 26.9%.,0
"Only a small change in glycemic index of women’s diet occurred after seeing a dietitian, pre- to post- implementation (-2.0 ± 4.4 vs. -3.0 ± 5.0).",0
Service limitations impaired the delivery of optimal care.,0
Partial adherence to the model of care may have attenuated changes in medication requirements and dietary patterns.,0
Full adherence may have resulted in even greater changes.,0
"Anaphylaxis associated with folic acid: domestic case review\n\nBackground\nSynthetic folic acid has been shown to cause serious, potentially life-threatening IgE mediated anaphylaxis [1-3].",0
Results\nAll 15 cases of anaphylaxis involved multi ingredient products with NHP doses (up to and including 1 mg).,0
"One case of anaphylaxis and 3 cases of serious allergic reaction involved women taking prenatal supplements, two of which reported spontaneous abortion.",0
There was insufficient case information available to assess any causal association between the allergic reaction and the fetal loss.,0
"Three medically important cases involved pharmaceutical doses of folic acid (5 mg), one of which was a pediatric case involving a multi ingredient intravenous total parental nutrition product (Multi-12/K1 pediatric) containing folic acid.",0
Conclusions\nFolic acid allergy appears to be rare and would not be expected to be well known among health providers or consumers.,0
Increasing awareness amongst health providers regarding folic acid allergy may improve the identification and counselling of patients with this allergy.,0
Should Men Take Prenatal Vitamins?,0
Short Communication\nCongenital abnormalities are the leading cause of infant mortalities in the United States (25%) and across the world [1].,0
"Potentially the most significant nutritional intervention has been the prenatal supplementation of folate, which has been shown to reduce the incidence of neural tube defects [3], limb malformations, urogenital abnormalities, cardiovascular malformations [4], and cleft lip or palate [5].",0
The influence of paternal diet on congenital abnormalities and fertility is still being elucidated.,0
A recent mouse study by Lambrot et al.,0
furthered our understanding of the effects of paternal folate deficiency [6].,0
Folate deficiency was associated with an increase in DNA damage in spermatocytes.,0
"However, there was no difference in sperm tail DNA fragmentation, tail length, or motility (p>0.05).",0
"Another study investigating the effect of a paternal folate-deficient diet in mice found a relationship with decreased placental weight, placental folate and an increased expression of the folate transporter folate receptor [7].",0
"A link has been found between paternal dioxin exposure, a component of the herbicide Agent Orange used in the Vietnam War, and spermatazoidfolate deficiency resulting in an increased rate of spina bifida [8].",0
"Although the precise mechanism is unclear, it is thought that epigenetic modifications (study of heritable changes in gene activity that are not caused by changes in the DNA sequence) play a role in both neural tube defects and decreased fertility of men with a folate deficiency [8].",0
"However, a prospective study of 42 couples, who had paternal methotrxate exposure at the time of conception, did not identify any congenital abnormalities [9].",0
The role of paternal nutrition on epigenetically linked heritable diseases such as cardiovascular and obesity have been suggested in epidemiological studies [10].,0
Human studies examining the role of paternal micronutrient supplementation are scant.,0
"investigated the role of supplemental folate, zinc and antioxidants (vitamins C, E, and β-carotene) on spermatocyte aneuploidy.",0
It is clear that a deficiency of paternal micronutrients could affect the development of offspring through epigenetic regulation.,0
"However, it is unclear at this time whether or not supplementation of vitamins such as folate can reduce congenital anomalies in men with an otherwise well-balanced diet.",0
A prospective randomized control trial is necessary to adequately determine the role for male prenatal vitamins.,0
"Due to the lack of conclusive evidence, we cannot recommend the ubiquitous use of prenatal vitamins, in particular folate, in men attempting to plan a pregnancy with their female partner at this time.",0
Fish Intake during Pregnancy and Foetal Neurodevelopment—A Systematic Review of the Evidence\n\nAbstract\nFish is a source of several nutrients that are important for healthy foetal development.,0
"Guidelines from Australia, Europe and the USA encourage fish consumption during pregnancy.",0
"The potential for contamination by heavy metals, as well as risk of listeriosis requires careful consideration of the shaping of dietary messages related to fish intake during pregnancy.",0
"This review critically evaluates literature on fish intake in pregnant women, with a focus on the association between neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring and maternal fish intake during pregnancy.",0
"Due to heterogeneity in methodology and measured outcomes, a qualitative comparison of study findings was conducted.",0
This review indicates that the benefits of diets providing moderate amounts of fish during pregnancy outweigh potential detrimental effects in regards to offspring neurodevelopment.,0
It is important that the type of fish consumed is low in mercury.,0
"Introduction\nFish is a source of several nutrients that are important during pregnancy for healthy foetal development including iodine, long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n- 3PUFAs), and vitamins A, D and B12 [1].",0
"Guidelines from Australia [2], Europe [3] and the USA [4] encourage the consumption of fish during pregnancy.",0
"Recent studies indicate that pregnant women lack sufficient knowledge regarding the importance of iodine and LC n -3 PUFAs [5,6], nutrients that are present in fish and seafood.",0
"In addition, it appears Australian women are falling short of LC n- 3PUFA intake recommendations during pregnancy [6,7].",0
"On average, Australian women are consuming 33 g of fish per day and pregnant women an average of 28 g of fish per day, below Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) recommended intakes [8].",0
"As well as being a source of essential nutrients, fish are also a potential source of contaminants including mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins [9].",0
"Guidelines emphasising the health risks of methyl-mercury, with little mention of important nutrients found in fish, may be contributing to women consuming less than the recommended fish servings during pregnancy [10].",0
Thus the risks and benefits resulting from fish consumption need to be considered and scientific evidence should direct advice given to pregnant women to help them make the safest choice.,0
"There are many documented health benefits from fish consumption with regard to foetal health, including improved neurodevelopment, increased birth weight and a reduced risk of spontaneous abortion [11,12].",0
"This review focuses on neurodevelopmental outcomes for the foetus as much of the published research into fish consumption during pregnancy has focused on methyl-mercury, LC n -3PUFAs and iodine, all known to impact foetal neurodevelopment [13,14].",0
The aim of this review was to critically appraise literature investigating fish intake in pregnant women to assess the hypothesis that fish consumption during pregnancy positively influences foetal neurodevelopment.,0
This review concludes with a discussion highlighting some of the methodological issues in researching associations between diet and infant neurodevelopment.,0
The search strategy did not yield any randomised controlled trials of fish intake in pregnant women and associated foetal neurodevelopmental outcomes.,0
"When mercury confounder was adjusted for, this association became significant: 4.0 (1.3 to 6.7).Mothers consuming greater than 2 fish serves per week had infants with the greatest VRM scores.Seafood intake during pregnancy was associated with a significant reduction in percentage of children with suboptimal IQ and behaviour test scores in 9 of 23 outcomes.Non-seafood consumers during pregnancy had children who scored lower on tests of verbal IQ at 8 years: OR (CI) for no seafood = 1.48 (1.16–1.90); some seafood 1.09 (0.92–1.20) compared with >340 g per week [overall trend: p = 0.004].Oily fish consumption more than once per week versus no oily fish reduced the risk of hyperactivity.No association with fish consumption in early pregnancy and full scale IQ, however, total fish intake in late pregnancy of 1 to 2 serves per week was associated with having a child with higher IQ at age 9 years.Higher intakes (3 or more serves per week) did not show a statistically significant improvement.Regression coefficients (95% CI) for fish consumption and full scale IQ: less than once per week vs. no fish = 7.76 (0.38 to 15.1), once or twice per week vs. no fish = 6.91 (0.19 to 13.6).Verbal IQ & fish consumption: Increase of 7.32 (0.26 to 14.4) with fish consumption once or twice per week.",0
"Trained examiners conducted Neurodevelopmental testing of child was completed via a Neonatal Behavioural Assessment 3 days post birth (28 behavioural & 18 reflex items).Comparator and ComparisonFish intake in quintilesWeekly servingsCategories: no fish (0 g), 1–2 servings (1–340 g per week), or 3 or more servings per week (over 340 g).Fish consumption:No fish serves, less than or equal to 2 servings per week, greater than 2 servings per week.Maternal fish intake of more than 2–3 times per week compared to up to once per week.No mention of intake in grams.Maternal seafood intake in grams (average intake = 300–360 g per week).OutcomeHighest 3 quintiles of fish intake resulted in improved motor, social/cognitive and total development scores at 18 months:OR (95%CI) = 1.28 (1.20, 1.38) for highest versus lowest quintile.This association was less obvious at 6 months (only the highest quintile showed significant improvement).Offspring of women who ate fish more than twice a week scored significantly higher on WRAVMA drawing and total scores compared with no serves.OR (95%CI) for WRAVMA drawing = 6.0 (1.8, 10.2) for more than two serves per week compared with no serves.WRAVMA total score = 5.3 (0.9, 9.6) for more than two serves per week compared to no serves.Pregnant women fish consumption greater than 2–3 times per week had children with significantly higher cognition and motor development scores compared to women consuming fish less than once a week.",0
This association was only significant in children breastfed for up to 6 months.Greater than 3 serves per week was not associated with improved outcomes.Seafood intake weakly ( p = 0.1) correlated with motor development.,0
"Other measures of neurodevelopment not significant in either direction.QualityNeutralPositivePositiveNeutral\nStudies were heterogeneous in methodology in regard to the covariates, neurological assessment tools, length of follow up statistical analyses.",0
"In addition, the type and amounts of fish consumed differed across study locations.",0
Due to this heterogeneity a qualitative rather than quantitative approach was deemed appropriate for comparison and presentation of findings.,0
tested children at six months of age using Visual Recognition Memory (VRM) paradigm and found a significant improvement of 2.8 points for each additional serving of fish (85–140 g) consumed by the mother during pregnancy [19].,0
found that the length of breastfeeding influenced whether a significant difference was found in offspring neurodevelopment when comparing high and low fish intakes during pregnancy [24].,0
Authors reported that fish consumption two to three times per week during pregnancy was beneficial for children who were breastfed for less than six months.,0
"However, no statistical improvement was indicated for those children who were breastfed for longer than six months [24].",0
demonstrated no adverse effects on offspring neurodevelopment with maternal fish consumption during pregnancy equal to or greater than once per week.,0
This study reported an improved verbal Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in offspring aged nine years in children born to mothers who consumed up to two servings of fish per week compared with children born to mothers who had not consumed any fish during late pregnancy (32 weeks gestation).,0
This association was not significant for fish consumption in early pregnancy (15 weeks gestation) suggesting that fish consumption may be of more benefit during the third trimester [21].,0
A report from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) found that fish consumption during pregnancy of one to three servings per week was shown to provide a modest but significant improvement in developmental scores of the offspring for language and social activity at fifteen to eighteen months of age [18].,0
A longer follow up of the ALSPAC cohort demonstrated a reduction in the percentage of children with suboptimal IQ at eight years of age amongst mothers with a high seafood intake (greater than 340 g) during pregnancy [20].,0
A smaller ( n = 498) Japanese study did not demonstrate a positive or negative association between maternal fish intake during pregnancy and neurodevelopment as measured by the Neonatal Behavioural Assessment tool in infants at three days of age [25].,0
"Conversely, results from a US cohort study demonstrated a significant improvement in IQ with consumption of more than two maternal servings of fish intake per week as assessed via ‘milestone’ achievement in children aged six months and eighteen months [23].",0
"Results from a large Danish national birth cohort ( n = 25,446) indicated a significant improvement in motor, cognitive and total developmental scores for eighteen month old children who were born to women within the highest three quintiles of fish intake during pregnancy.",0
"At six months, this improvement was only significant for children of women in the highest quintile of fish consumption, suggesting that age of testing may be relevant [22].",0
Seven of the eight reviewed articles showed a beneficial impact on certain measures of offspring neurodevelopment with fish intake ranging from less than one to three or more servings of fish per week.,0
"Thus, the evidence in these cohort studies supports the current recommendations for fish consumption during pregnancy [2,3,4].",0

Discussion\nThis systematic review of observational cohort studies demonstrates an association between consumption of one or more servings of fish per week during pregnancy and better offspring neurodevelopment outcomes.,0
[21] was the only study to report a neutral effect of seafood intake on all neurodevelopmental outcomes.,0
"However, in that study neurodevelopment was assessed when the infant was only three days old.",0
"The seven studies, which demonstrated a benefit in neurodevelopment, had a follow up time ranging from six months to nine years.",0
Thus it is possible that longer follow up may be needed to determine significant associations.,0
This concept is supported by Oken et al.,0
which found an improvement in neurodevelopmental scores at six months in only the highest quintile of fish intake while this improvement was evident in the highest three quintiles at eighteen months [22].,0
"[24] found that seafood consumption that excluded fish intake had a detrimental effect on neurodevelopment, while fish intake alone led to improved outcomes.",0
Thus it is possible that the study of Suzuki et al.,0
[25] may have detected a benefit had fish been considered separately from total seafood.,0
[21] reported differences in outcomes associated with oily fish intake and total fish intake in early compared to late pregnancy.,0
This suggests that the type of fish and timing of consumption during pregnancy may impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes of offspring.,0
"However, this information is limited to a single study, which was conducted in a relatively small sample ( n = 217).",0
More research in this area is required to draw sound conclusions.,0
It is important to note the number methodological limitations in research on diet and infant neurodevelopment that are present in these studies.,0
"This prevents the conclusion of a definitive relationship without further research, preferably clinical randomised controlled trials, and a proper meta-analysis.",0
Measuring dietary intake in cohort studies is problematic due to the difficulty in obtaining detailed information without causing significant subject burden.,0
"No studies reported adjusting results from the FFQ for energy intake, a recommendation made by Freedman et al .",0
"Three studies [19,21,24] reported on the frequency of consumption without specifying the weight of fish servings while the remaining studies made assumptions based on standard serving sizes, as to the quantity of fish consumed at each occasion.",0
This limits the accuracy of a quantifiable conclusion as due to individual variability in the perception of a ‘serving size’.,0
Assessing cognitive development differences in infancy and childhood is fraught with difficulties due to the nature of childhood development and the accurate measurement of such.,0
"Firstly, children develop in ‘spurts’ rather than in a continuous fashion, which means they may slip in and out of the ‘normal’ reference ranges, particularly in the earlier years [27,28].",0
"To combat this, it has been suggested that testing occurs at more than one time point [27] and that testing should extend beyond the first two years, preferable to school aged children in order to detect more subtle differences [28].",0
"Only 4 studies tested at multiple time points [18,21,22,24], four beyond two years [20,21,23,24], and only two looked at children of school age [20,21].",0
"Secondly, there are multiple interrelated factors which impact on neurodevelopment, and not all confounders were accounted for in all analyses.",0
"However, factors including ethnicity, paternal intelligence, the home environment, drug use, dietary patterns, supplement use and maternal responsiveness were not always measured.",0
"[20] included the home environment as a confounder, but not paternal IQ.",0
"Conversely, the two studies by Oken et al.",0
The remaining four studies did not correct for either paternal IQ or home environment.,0
No studies adjusted for maternal responsiveness which has been shown to be related to developmental outcomes independent of sociodemographic factors [28].,0
An intake of fish may reflect a health conscious diet and thus the positive effects may not be directly attributed to the fish but rather to the diet as a whole.,0
considered maternal diet by classifying women as following a “prudent” or “western” dietary pattern [23].,0
"[20] also adjusted for maternal diet, while Mendez et al.",0
Other studies did not effectively account for dietary intake and are thus at risk of bias.,0
"[20] reported that only 1.7% of women consumed fish oil supplements not affecting outcomes, however, this study did not consider supplements other than fish oil.",0
Only Mendez et al.,0
[24] included supplement usage as a confounder.,0
There is no universal standard for which neurodevelopmental tests are most appropriate for use in children of varying ages and at what age meaningful differences in neurocognitive development can be detected [29].,0
"Performance in assessments can be significantly altered if the participant is hungry, tired or fearful of being in a strange place or being tested [27].",0
The accuracy of the tests for the population depends on when the test was standardised and within what population.,0
"In particular the Denver test, utilised in the ALSPAC study [18] has been criticised for its low specificity and potentially outdated ‘norm’ as it was standardised in 1980 [30].",0
"Research on the reliability of parental reports on child development is conflicting [31], Daniels et al.",0
"[22] used developmental testing carried out by the mother and thus results may not be as reliable as those reported by other studies, which used trained professionals.",0
"Due to the risks associated with consuming fish and seafood during pregnancy related to food safety and heavy metal contamination, pregnant women may question the necessity of including these foods in their diets, when nutrition supplements are readily accessible in Western countries [32].",0
A systematic review of randomised control trials examining LC n -3PUFA supplementation during pregnancy found no clear association between supplement use and infant cognitive outcomes [33].,0
"This may be attributable to the synergistic effects of food [34] and associated with fish being a source of other nutrients which are important for infant development such as iodine and vitamin D. Presently, there have been no randomised control trials examining neurocognitive outcomes associated with prenatal multivitamin use and infant neurodevelopment, and these are unlikely to occur given ethical implications of such [35].",0
Recent research has suggested that effects of methyl-mercury on infant brain development may be mediated by LC n -3PUFA [36].,0
"Because it is possible to consume fish and seafood safely during pregnancy, through following recommendations to limit high mercury species, it is prudent to recommend that pregnant women consume these foods, rather than rely on supplementation, in order to maximise infant neurodevelopment outcomes.",0
Conclusions\nThis review assessed the hypothesis that fish intake during pregnancy improves offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes.,0
"A review of the available evidence indicates that intake of fish during pregnancy is associated with positive foetal neurodevelopmental outcomes, as supported by seven of eight articles reviewed, which showed a beneficial impact on foetal neurodevelopment with one or more servings of fish per week compared with no fish intake.",0
Based on the results from these observational studies the current recommendation of two to three servings per week appears appropriate.,0
"Randomised clinical trials have been conducted using fish oil supplementation in pregnancy, but not with fish considered as a whole food.",0
Existing evidence is currently insufficient to inform advice regarding fish intake during pregnancy.,0
"Further well designed studies are required to strengthen the evidence base regarding the type and quantity of maternal fish consumption during pregnancy and associated neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring, while considering the contribution of mercury from fish-containing diets.",0
"In other words, ICDS reflects the country’s obligation to enhance the pre-school education rates and an effective strategy to break the vicious cycle of malnutrition, infection and mortality (3).",0
The rationale to deliver a bunch of services is to mutually enhance the impact of a specific service with the aid of other services in the long-run (2).,0
"As far as the vacancy status is concerned, almost 33.9%, 35%, 7.1%, and 7.2% of CDPOs, Supervisors, Anganwadi workers and Anganwadi helpers posts are still vacant in the country.",0
"Different indicator such as the number of beneficiaries enrolled in Anganwadicentre for supplementary nutrition or for preschool education has been proposed to monitor the implementation of the scheme in different Anganwadi centres of the country (1,5).",0
Findings of a study revealed the positive impact on reducing the levels of anemia in children between 6-60 months in India (6).,0
"In another study conducted in rural pocket of Varanasi to evaluate the impact of ICDS on maternal nutrition and birth weight, it was concluded that undernourished antenatal women are definitely benefitted by late pregnancy nutrition supplement (7).",0
"In the mission to enhance and compound the benefit of services delivered under ICDS, Government of India has developed partnerships with the international agencies like United Nations International Children’ Emergency Fund (for providing technical guidance in developing need-based training plans; assist in organizing scientific workshops; and in impact assessment on early childhood nutrition and development), Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (contribution in the areas of maternal and child health, girl primary education, etc.",0
"As a part of the capacity building efforts, the Ministry of Women & Child Development has recommended policy related and institutional transformations.",0
"The strategy is to develop Anganwadi as a “vibrant early childhood development centre” by giving greater focus on under three years children, strengthening early childhood education, and by ensuring care and counseling of mothers and family.",0
"In addition, the Ministry is planning to improve the supplementary nutrition services; creating Anganwadi based crèches centers; intensify monitoring, and training activities; to develop linkages with different stakeholders such as Pan-chayati Raj Institutions and ministry of rural development (1).",0
"To conclude, the ICDS scheme is a comprehensive approach for delivering an integrated package of services to bring about a significant improvement in the child related health, care, and nutrition practices of the community.",0

"These recommendations were pooled into themes of which the most prevalent theme concerned health centre amenities (20.2%) such as good toilet facilities, cleanliness, reduced congestion and preferential care towards the women in aspects such as rapid delivery of laboratory results.",0
The respondents also wished that the health talks (16.3%) should be more regular and that primigravida should be encouraged to come regularly.,0
"Women of high educational level were the most interested in the health talk recommendation (76% of all recommendations were made by this class of respondents), arguing that the “lectures” should be more detailed than what they were at the moment.",0
Discussion\nThe study aimed at exploring the perceptions of pregnant women attending antenatal clinic in the public health centres in the Buea Health District regarding antenatal care in terms of their knowledge and satisfaction with service delivery.,0
"[""It also sought to establish reasons that determined these women's choice of ANC site as well as explore the geographic distribution of the women with respect to their residence and their attending health centre.""]",0
Only 6% of women started visits in the first trimester while 14.5% began in the third trimester.,0
"This observation is similar to studies carried out in Kenya [13] and South Africa [14] where women started clinic late because of perceived lack of benefit, limited facility access, uncertainty about pregnancy and “laziness” to go for many visits.",0
Late antenatal visits attendance is detrimental because it prevents the clients from obtaining the maximum benefits from the antenatal service [14–16].,0
"With respect to the reasons that influenced the respondents’ choice of health centre, the main factor affecting the choice of ANC site was geographical accessibility.",0
This observation is similar to that seen in Uganda [17] and Zimbabwe [18] where it was also shown that the quality of care provided was contributory.,0
This illustrates the importance of previous contact with a facility to determine further use.,0
"Here, the perception of the past users is the only driving tool to refer.",0
The husband has been shown to play a significant role in determining the choice of ANC site by the woman in a Nigerian [19] and Ugandan study [20] where they accounted for 43% and 32% of all recommendations respectively.,0
"Evaluation of the reasons why 55.2% of respondents changed their ANC site, revealed that the change of residence, closeness to the health facility and the quality of care offered at the previous site were the predominant reasons.",0
"[""This further emphasizes the importance of distance as a dominant factor in determining women's choice of site [19].""]",0
"Hence efforts should be geared towards improving on health centre variables (cleanliness, comfort in sitting area and quality of care amongst others) to improve on their utilization by the women who live nearby especially for those health centres which are relatively new and by so doing increasing their attendance rate.",0
"[""Pregnant women's knowledge about the timing, goals of ANC visits, and the number of antenatal visits was very high among the study participants contrary to what was shown in studies carried out in Tanzania [14] and South Africa [15].""]",0
"Concerning the number of ANC visits, the health centres follow the Western model of clinic visits with an average of 10 to 12 visits.",0
"However, attitudes are changing towards the “minimum of 4 visits” recommended by the WHO after the work of Nigenda et al [21] and Langer et al.",0
"If this approach is vulgarized, it might increase the uptake of ANC services and improve on the quality of health care.",0
The health care education topics were similar among the studies reviewed though there were some disparities in the frequency.,0
"[""45.2% of respondents received information on the detection or management of pregnancy danger signs, an observation similar to the 42% in Pembe's study in Tanzania [23].""]",0
"In marked contrast, the Kenyan study by Ouma and collaborators [24] and that in Nigeria by Dairo and Owoyokun [25] found that only 10.4% and up to 89.6% of pregnant women were informed of pregnancy danger signs respectively.",0
This accounts for the low rate of these health talks in this study as opposed to other studies [26].,0
Respondents rated the services provided at the health centres generally as satisfactory.,0
"The services offered were acceptable in contrast with observations from other studies in Sub-Saharan countries such as in Uganda by Cham et al [27] and that by van Eijket al [4] in Kenya where for example, urine and serological tests are not routinely done.",0
"With regards to waiting time at the clinic, the women recognized that most of the time wasting was due to late coming of their fellow pregnant women.",0
"However, dissatisfaction abounded with respect to this aspect, especially for women of higher educational levels.",0
The women with high level of education and women attending for their first pregnancies were not satisfied with the competence of the staff.,0
Most of them recommended an improvement in the nurses’ skills.,0
"However, women attending for their subsequent pregnancies and those at their third or more visits were more tolerant of the services provided at the health centres.",0
This is probably because their contact with the health system had tailored their expectations and they expressed satisfaction with the existing services.,0
"Women attending ANC for their subsequent pregnancies probably had a notion of what health topics were discussed during clinic sessions and so their objectives at ANC were not only aimed at acquiring knowledge about diet, danger signs and other topics but also in the state of their babies.",0
Primigravida on the contrary expected vital information from the health talks to help them cope well with their pregnancy and labor [29].,0
"However, an Australian study showed that both women and providers thought the time for antenatal classes was too small to incorporate all they had to learn with some women complaining of having received too much information [29].",0
"These results are similar to other studies of patient satisfaction; (96.5%) in Ibadan, Nigeria [7] and 86.4% in Ogun State, Nigeria [25].",0
"However, it has been said that the views of pregnant women concerning their care is generally positive as they tend to be uncritical of healthcare, accepting whatever care they receive as appropriate [29].",0
"[""Thus using patient views to evaluate health care has been criticized [30], regarding their responses as a mixture of the healthcare performance measurement and the respondent's reflection.""]",0
"Nevertheless, patient views provide an insight to the care provided and the system as a whole.",0
The influence of the educational level of respondents is predominant here as it is noticed that those at a high educational level are more likely to be critical about care received and defer a positive satisfaction.,0
"This issue was also revealed in Fawole and colleagues’ study [7] where they hypothesized that as the level of education in the community steadily increases, pregnant women may become more and more critical of health care.",0
Hence there is a need to mobilize efforts for a better quality assessment in our health care provision with the aim of improving quality in terms of provision of health care services.,0
Improvement must be made to attain a desired change and amelioration in our health care delivery package.,0
"The users’ opinion has been sought here and it is noticed that they recommend ameliorations in the interpersonal interaction with staff in terms of more comprehensive health talks and improvement in nursing skills, better infrastructures(like good toilet facilities and comfortable sitting areas) and tolerable waiting times.",0
A step in this direction will go a long way to consolidate the improvement in health care delivery sought by Cameroon in the framework of the MDGs.,0
Conclusion\nAbout one third of pregnant women in our study population attended an ANC site different from their local catchment area despite the availability of ANC in their residential area.,0
"[""High educational level and primiparity are negatively associated with pregnant women's satisfaction of care received at ANC.""]",0
"Taken together, policy makers should implement changes in the health care delivery system taking into account the users’ opinion, more so in the light of increasing female education in Cameroon.",0
"Pre-pregnancy body mass index, weight gain and energy intake in pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus\n\nBackground\nStudies have shown that maternal obesity is associated with increased risk of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM).",0
Excessive gestational weight gain is also associated with risk of GDM.,0
"Moreover, dietary factors, before and during pregnancy, have been linked to increased risk for GDM.",0
"Nutritional intervention is important for the control of GDM, as it provides benefits to mother and fetal health.",0
"However, the literature remains inconclusive on the role of dietary factors in the development of this disease.",0

Further studies are needed to better elucidate the role of dietary factors and specific nutrients in the risk for this disease.,0

"Circulating Cathelicidin Concentrations in a Cohort of Healthy Children: Influence of Age, Body Composition, Gender and Vitamin D Status\n\nAbstract\nCathelicidin is an antimicrobial peptide whose circulating levels are related to vitamin D status in adults.",0
"This study sought to determine if circulating cathelicidin concentrations in healthy children are related to the age of the child, body composition and vitamin D status at birth and at the time of the study visit.",0
"The cohort’s median cathelicidin concentration was 28.1 ng/mL (range: 5.6–3368.6) and did not correlate with 25(OH)D, but was positively correlated with advancing age (ρ = 0.236 & p = 0.005, respectively).",0
"Increased age and male gender were correlated with increased cathelicidin when controlling for race/ethnicity, percent fat, and child’s current 25(OH)D concentration (p = 0.028 & p = 0.047, respectively).",0
"This study demonstrated that as children age, the concentration of cathelicidin increases.",0
"Furthermore, male gender was significantly associated with increased cathelicidin concentrations.",0
The lack of association between vitamin D status and cathelicidin in this study may be due to the narrow range in observed 25(OH)D values and warrants additional studies for further observation.,0
"Previous studies have focused on cathelicidin and vitamin D concentrations in patient populations affected by various illnesses or diseases [6], such as tuberculosis [7], pneumonia [8], sepsis [9], HIV [10–12], and end-stage renal disease hemodialysis [13], as well as healthy adult populations [14–19].",0
"Additionally, while one study examined the levels of maternal and neonatal vitamin D and cathelicidin concentrations in healthy children at delivery, there is a lack of research to determine correlations between vitamin D status and cathelicidin among healthy children over time [20], as well as which factors such as age of the child, gender, and body composition may independently impact cathelicidin concentrations.",0
"To address this gap in the literature, the aim of this follow-up study was to determine if maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy and/or a child’s current vitamin D status affect the circulating concentration of cathelicidin in healthy children years after delivery.",0
A second aim was to determine if the concentration of cathelicidin and vitamin D correlate with the number of infections a child experiences during childhood and as a function of age.,0
It was hypothesized that (1) total current circulating 25(OH)D would be positively correlated with cathelicidin in children; (2) children with higher plasma cathelicidin concentrations would have had fewer infections than children with lower cathelicidin concentrations; and (3) cathelicidin concentration would increase with advancing age.,0
A post-hoc analysis was conducted to determine if BMI and percent fat had an effect on cathelicidin concentration.,0
"Four multivariable regressions were performed to assess whether any significant associations existed between the natural logarithm of each subject’s cathelicidin concentration and each of the following vitamin D measurements: (1) child’s current 25(OH)D at time of follow-up, (2) child’s 25(OH)D at birth, (3) maternal 25(OH)D throughout pregnancy (Visits 3 to 7 as area under the curve), and (4) maternal 25(OH)D one month before delivery; all analyses controlled for race/ethnicity, age, gender, and percent fat.",0

"White mothers were found to have a significantly higher 25(OH)D concentration (45.8 ng/mL; 114.5 nmol/L) than both Black (34.8 ng/mL; 87.0 nmol/L) and Hispanic mothers (38.0 ng/mL; 95.0 nmol/L) throughout pregnancy (p≤0.0001 and ≤0.0001, respectively).",0
Black and Hispanic mothers were found to have a statistically significant difference in 25(OH)D concentrations throughout pregnancy as well (p≤0.0001).,0

"Despite differences in vitamin D status, there were no significant associations between cathelicidin, race/ethnicity and vitamin D status (see Table 2 ).",0
"In addition, there were no significant correlations found between concentration of cathelicidin and the child’s 25(OH)D concentration at birth, maternal 25(OH)D within one month of delivery, or maternal 25(OH)D area under the curve from pregnancy visits 3–7.",0
"Within the entire cohort, age of the child and cathelicidin concentration demonstrated a positive correlation (ρ = 0.236, p = 0.005).",0

"In the group of children with a total circulating 25(OH)D concentration ≥20 ng /mL, cathelicidin concentration was significantly positively associated with age (ρ = 0.373, p = 0.0002).",0
"Within this same group, cathelicidin concentration was negatively associated with the number of documented infections a child experienced in the last year (ρ = -0.205, p = 0.047).",0
"In each of the models, however, the child’s age at their first follow-up visit was significantly and independently positively correlated with cathelicidin.",0
"Thus, Model 1 indicates that every 1-year increase in a child’s age is associated with a 0.145 unit increase in their log cathelicidin concentration, equivalent to a e0.145= 1.2-fold increase from 1 year to the next.",0
"In Models 1 and 4), higher cathelicidin concentrations were significantly associated with male gender (beta = 0.318, p = 0.047), indicating that after adjusting for the other variables in the model, males’ cathelicidin levels were 1.4 times higher than females’.",0

"A positive correlation between age and cathelicidin and between gender and cathelicidin were noted, with higher concentrations in male children.",0
"Regardless of vitamin D status, there was no statistically significant difference in cathelicidin concentrations between subjects, consistent with the findings of other recent studies [6,7,12,14,17,20].",0
"Varying observations, however, have been made when determining whether a correlation between 25(OH)D and cathelicidin concentrations exists.",0
"In the literature, recent studies across a wide range of populations have demonstrated a positive correlation between 25(OH)D and cathelicidin [8–11,15,16,18,19].",0
"Differences in age, health and initial vitamin D status between cohorts, as well as study design, may explain the conflicting data.",0
"Of note, most of the children in this study were not vitamin D deficient and the vitamin D ranges were relatively narrow.",0
"Additionally, the lack of correlation may suggest that circulating cathelicidin concentration is not reflective of what is happening at the cellular level, and in this regard, cathelicidin mRNA expression by immune cells or target tissue may be a better indicator of vitamin D’s long-term effect on the cathelicidin system.",0
Adipose tissue is also believed to be associated with vitamin D [26–29].,0
"This result is consistent with the findings of Jeng et al., who also showed no correlation with BMI and cathelicidin in adults with sepsis [9].",0
"Although not significant, a negative trend was seen between the number of infections a child experienced and cathelicidin concentration.",0
"This suggests that cathelicidin may have a protective benefit in preventing disease, which is consistent with its antimicrobial properties.",0
This is an exciting area of study; especially as antibiotic resistance becomes an increasing problem.,0
"Investigating ways to improve natural immune function and limit the number of infections people experience is of great importance…\nIn this study, a positive correlation between age and cathelicidin was shown.",0
This positive correlation between cathelicidin and age was also shown in the oral environment when examining cathelicidin concentrations in saliva in healthy children aged 2 to 18 years [30].,0
"Importantly, as Alvarez–Rodriguez and colleagues have found a negative correlation between age and immune function in healthy adult subjects, especially those over the age of 60 [15], perhaps innate immune function, in particular cytokine function, increases with age for a period of time, reaches a threshold and then decreases later in life.",0
"Interestingly, our findings that male gender correlates with cathelicidin peeks further interest in understanding gender differences in regards to the immune system.",0
"Notably, in the aforementioned study examining localized cathelicidin concentrations in saliva, the female gender was found to positively correlate with cathelicidin [30].",0
These findings highlight the differences one may find when examining localized and circulating levels of immune factors.,0
Limitations of this study include the cohort size and an unequal distribution of subjects within age groups.,0
"As such, this study should be repeated with a larger sample size to replicate its findings.",0
Inclusion of older children and young adults would allow cathelicidin to be followed throughout a longer period of childhood development and further describe how cathelicidin and innate immune function develop over time.,0
"Lastly, total circulating cathelicidin was measured rather than cell-specific mRNA expression of cathelicidin or 1,25(OH)2D3concentration [17], which may be more closely linked with vitamin D status during fetal and childhood development.",0
"In conclusion, this study is the first to examine cathelicidin concentrations in healthy children over time.",0
It assists in identifying the normal ranges of circulating cathelicidin concentrations found in healthy children.,0
"It also supports the premise that cathelicidin increases with increasing age, particularly in males.",0
"With further study, cathelicidin may serve as a biomarker of enhanced immune function over time in children with age-based norms.",0
"Objective\nTo determine if the effects of HV gestational diets on obesogenic phenotypes in the offspring arise as a consequence of altered hypothalamic control of feeding behavior and if their increased food intake could be prevented by feeding them HV or high folate (10-fold folate, HFol) diets.",0
The HFol pup diet partially brought BDNF to the control level (P=0.02) and lowered SeroR2A (P=0.008).,0
"Conclusion\nThe obesogenic phenotype in offspring from HV fed dams is prevented by feeding HV or HFol pup diets, possibly due to post-weaning modulation of food intake regulatory mechanisms.",0
"INTRODUCTION\nDiets consumed during pregnancy and early postnatal life shape the developmental trajectory of the offspring.1,2Although vitamins contribute to all phases of development,3the effects of multivitamin consumption above requirements (but at non-toxic levels) during pregnancy as determinants of physiologic phenotypes of the offspring have received little attention.",0
"We have shown recently that feeding a diet containing 10-fold the recommended multivitamin content (HV) to Wistar rats during pregnancy results in increased food intake, obesity and characteristics of the metabolic syndrome in both adult male4and female5offspring weaned to the recommended vitamin (RV) diet.",0
"Because the hypothalamus is an important regulator of food intake and appetite control,6it can be hypothesized that the HV diet alters development of feeding neurocircuitry in the offspring resulting in an obesogenic phenotype.",0
"Disordered regulation of feeding pathways can affect growth and metabolism, consequently driving the appearance of metabolic syndrome later in life.7,8\nAn extension of the concept that early life factors contribute to chronic diseases is described by the predictive adaptive response (PAR) hypothesis, which suggests that a mismatch between in utero and postnatal environment increases the risk of developing disease in adulthood.9,10It has been proposed that the offspring modify their phenotype based on their in utero environment in order to adapt to the predicted postnatal setting.",0
"Based on the PAR hypothesis, the high multivitamin gestational diet would lead to developmental adaptation in the offspring consistent with a high vitamin post-weaning environment.",0
"If so, it would be predicted that it is this mismatch between the HV diet fed to the dams and the vitamin content of diets fed to the offspring that leads to an obesogenic phenotype.",0
"The effect of high vitamin maternal diets on chronic disease in the offspring can be attributed primarily to epigenetic modulation of gene expression leading to programming of regulatory systems.11Because methyl group vitamins, and specifically folate, have been shown to participate in epigenetic changes through its functions in DNA methylation,12we also fed offspring a high folate (HFol) diet.",0
"Therefore, we hypothesized that the effects of HV gestational diets on obesogenic phenotype in the offspring arise as a consequence of altered hypothalamic control of feeding behavior and these effects could be prevented by feeding them HV or HFol diets.",0
"Our primary objective was to compare the effects of RV, HV and HFol pup diets on food intake, body weight, glucose control and hypothalamic gene expression of feeding neuropeptides in offspring born to HV dams with offspring born to RV dams and weaned to RV diet.",0
The acceptance capacity of methyl groups in the whole genome is known to be inversely related to the exogenous3H-methyl incorporation.,0
"In contrast, male offspring from the HV dams weaned to either the HFol or HV pup diet did not differ in food intake, weight gain and glucose response compared to those from the RV dams (Figure 2,3,4).",0
Hypothalamic Gene Expression\nThe HV but not HFol pup diet brought POMC expression to control levels in mature offspring from HV dams (P=0.004) (Figure 5a).,0
The HV pup diet brought BDNF expression to control levels but the HFol pup diet only attenuated the decrease in expression caused by the HV gestational diet (P=0.02) (Figure 5a).,0
Only the HFol pup diet lowered SeroR2A expression compared to the HV offspring weaned to a RV pup diet (P=0.008) (Figure 5b).,0
There was a trend for lower DopaR1 expression in the HV offspring weaned to a HV pup diet compared to the RV offspring (P=0.06) (Figure 5b).,0
Folate Status\nBoth brain (Figure 6a) and plasma (Figure 6b) folate levels were unaffected by the diets of the dams but were elevated by the high multivitamin or high folate pup diet.,0
"DISCUSSION\nOur findings support the hypothesis that HV or HFol pup diet prevents the increase in food intake, body weight and glucose response to a glucose load in offspring of the HV dams, possibly by post-weaning changes in food intake regulatory systems.",0
"Although the role of hypothalamic regulation in determining the phenotype is uncertain, our gene expression data are novel because we show that feeding neurocircuitry undergoes modification both in utero and into maturity.",0
Two lines of evidence support the PAR hypothesis.,0
"First, an unmatched RV post-weaning diet fed the offspring born to HV dams resulted in increased food intake and characteristics of the metabolic syndrome, as observed previously.4Second, the HV and HFol post-weaning diets prevented these effects.",0
"There were significant effect of both diet and time, but no interaction between them on food intake and weight gain, suggesting that vitamin diets strongly alter the phenotype of mature offspring independent of time.",0
"Because the negative consequences of the HV gestational diet on food intake, weight gain and glucose control were prevented by feeding either the HV or HFol pup diets, these observations support the PAR hypothesis that offspring fed diets similar to their mothers lead to a more appropriate adaptation to their postnatal environment compared to those fed an unmatched diet.",0
"Elevated folate levels in the brain and plasma at maturity confirmed the folate content of the HV and HFol post-weaning diets, and importantly, revealed that the brain responds to the post-weaning diet.",0
"Although the HV and HFol post-weaning diets had similar effects on food intake, weight gain and blood glucose response by preventing the negative consequences of the HV gestational diet, they differed in their impact on expression in food intake regulatory genes in the hypothalamus.",0
"Overall the data support the hypothesis that the cause of the phenotype of HV offspring fed RV diets may be accounted for by its effects in utero on development of hypothalamic pathways of intake regulation, leading to excess food intake, and consequently increased body weight and characteristics of the metabolic syndrome.4Offspring born to dams fed the HV diet during pregnancy had lower expression of POMC and BDNF, which are anorexigenic (appetite-suppressing) genes,20,21compared to those born to dams on the RV diet.",0
Lower expression of the anorexigenic genes in the offspring of dams fed the multivamins during pregnancy is consistent with the observed increased food intake.,0
Our results are consistent with other data showing that early nutrition alters the central appetite regulatory network.22Effects of the maternal diet on the hypothalamic expression of food intake regulatory pathways were found in lambs of ewes fed a diet that exceeded their energy requirement.,0
"These lambs were fatter but had higher hypothalamic POMC expression at postnatal day 30 and relative milk intake of these lambs was not different from those born to control-fed mothers after the third postnatal week.23In contrast, the data from the present study show that higher food intake in adulthood of offspring born to the HV dams and fed the RV diet is consistent with their lower expression of anorexigenic neuropeptides in the hypothalamus.",0
"However, there was no gestational HV diet effect on expression of leptin and insulin receptors, which are known to modulate expression of orexigenic and anorexigenic neurons regulating energy intake.24–26Despite this lack of difference, other neurons downstream regulating food intake such as POMC and BDNF may be affected by the high vitamin diets.",0
A novel observation of our study is that the hypothalamic feeding pathways respond to the vitamin content of the post-weaning diet.,0
"Because expression of these anorexigenic neuropeptides was normalized, it may be suggested that vitamin content of post-weaning diets contribute to remodeling of hypothalamic functioning in mature as well as developing rats.",0
"Furthermore, there was a trend for lower expression of DopaR1 in the HV offspring weaned to a HV diet compared to the control offspring.",0
"In the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, dopamine release is required to initiate a meal, and is positively associated with meal number and duration.27,28By possibly reducing dopamine signaling, the HV pup diet may have provided some protection against excess food intake caused by the HV gestational diet.",0
"Although we are the first to show that the brain at maturity responds to vitamins, our results are substantiated by a report of hypothalamic changes in the food intake regulatory genes due to the interaction of maternal and post-weaning diets high in saturated fats in male offspring.29\nSurprisingly, a ten-fold addition of folate alone to the RV diet modified some of the effects of the maternal HV diet on the offspring, suggesting a possible primary role for this methyl group vitamin.",0
"A significant role for folate in the complete vitamin mixture in determining the effect of the HV diet was supported by the reductions in food intake, body weight and blood glucose.",0
"However, folate had fewer effects on the hypothalamus of offspring born to HV dams.",0
"Because POMC was not brought to control levels, vitamins other than folate may play a role in correcting POMC.",0
"The HFol pup diet reduced SeroR2A expression in mature offspring of the dams fed the HV diet, but not by the HV pup diet (Figure 5b).",0
"BDNF was corrected to similar levels by the HV diet, and only partially by the HFol pup diet.",0
"Previous studies have shown that BDNF increases serotonin turnover in the hypothalamus,30,31suggesting that the effect of gestational and post-weaning diets on BDNF mRNA levels may explain some compensatory response in SeroR2A expression.",0
The fact that we did not observe differences in other subtypes of SeroR may indicate that SeroR2A is more sensitive to BDNF-induced changes by the vitamin diets.,0
"Because BDNF may be differentially expressed in specific regions of the hypothalamus, where high levels are present in the ventromedial hypothalamus,32the relationship between BDNF and SeroR is unknown from whole hypothalamus in our study.",0
"Although folate has been shown to be an active participant in methyltransfer reactions,12global methylation was not affected by either the gestational or post-weaning diet.",0
"However this is not surprising because previous studies have reported that DNA methylation of genes in the absence of a detectable change in global methylation, suggesting that epigenetic changes are site-specific.33In addition, the RV, HV and HFol diets in our study contain high amounts of choline, which is another factor affecting DNA methylation,34,35and it alone may have obscured detection of the effect of folate on methylation.",0
The metabolism of choline and other methyl group vitamins (ie.,0
"folate, vitamin B6 and B12) is closely linked.36\nA significant weakness of the study arises from the lack of measurement of gene expression at different stages of maturity.",0
"Thus, we do not know the stage of maturation when the post-weaning diets altered the hypothalamus.",0
"In addition to hypothalamic genes, measurement of genes in regions of the brain involved in reward and motivation may have contributed to a fuller understanding of the overall impact of the diets on regulation of food intake.",0
"It has been shown that mice fed post-weaning a high fat diet (60% calories from fat) had lower expression of the μ-opioid receptor gene which influences reward circuitry in the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex.37\nIn conclusion, the obesogenic phenotype in offspring from HV fed dams may be a consequence of altered hypothalamic control of feeding behavior but can be prevented by feeding them HV or HFol pup diets.",0
A randomized controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation on perinatal depression: in Iranian pregnant mothers\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nMood disorders in pregnancy and post-partum period are common and considered as a public health issue.,0
"Researchers have studied the relationship between low serum vitamin D concentration and perinatal depression, although no clinical trial has been conducted on vitamin D’s effects on depression related to childbirth.",0
This study evaluated the effect of vitamin D3supplementation on perinatal depression scores.,0
Results\nThe two groups were similar in relation to baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations.,0
"However, at childbirth, the vitamin D group had significantly higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration in comparison to the control group ( p\u2009<\u20090.001 ).",0
Conclusions\nThe present trial showed that consuming 2000\xa0IU vitamin D3daily during late pregnancy was effective in decreasing perinatal depression levels.,0
We suggest further clinical trial in pregnant mothers who are at risk for postnatal depression.,0
Background\nMood disorders in pregnancy and post-partum period are common and considered as a public health issue.,0
"In recent decades researchers have paid great amount of attention to these subjects and showed that mood illness related to childbirth can lead to serious complications for mother, fetus, newborn and family [1,2].",0
Evidence shows that postnatal depression is an extension of antenatal depression which continues postpartum.,0
"This problem can have negative effects on infant development and can cause behavioral, cognitive, social and emotional problems in infant which could continue throughout childhood [3–5].",0
Prevalence of postpartum depression varies throughout the world; however researchers have used different scales and cut off points to describe this psychological disorder.,0
This study has reported the prevalence of postnatal depression up to 60\xa0% [6].,0
"The prevalence of postnatal depression in some Asian countries has been reported between 22 and 46.9\xa0% [7,8].",0
Several studies have shown a high prevalence of postnatal depression in Iran.,0
"In the meta-analysis of Veisani et al., postnatal depression was reported at 25.3\xa0% [9], and in two recent studies in eastern and central part of Iran, the prevalence has been reported at 28.9–34.8\xa0% [10,11].",0
"The spread and importance of postpartum depression have led researchers to create preventative methods such as educational programs, modified care, dietary supplements, antidepressant medication and social support [12–14].",0
"While, the circulating half-life of 1, 25(OH) 2D is around 4\xa0h. Its blood concentration is 1000 times less than 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Serum levels of PTH, calcium, and phosphate have influence on regulatory and production of 1,25(OH)2D.",0
Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D reflects the body’s vitamin D reserves and this is a well-known indicator for examining vitamin D status [15].,0
"Several studies have revealed that vitamin D supplementation can raise vitamin D reserves gradually, according to baseline concentration of vitamin D, dose and duration of consumption [16–18].",0
"In accordance to a guideline by Holick et al., 6–8 weeks consumption of a high dose vitamin D supplement are essential to obtain an adequate blood reserves of vitamin D [19].",0
"It seems that in addition to calcium homeostasis and bone health, vitamin D is also essential for brain development and function [20,21].",0
"Therefore, the brain can regionally activate vitamin D, which implicates vitamin D’s role in brain function more prominent [22–25].",0
"Studies have shown that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration is associated with psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression and reduced cognitive function [26,27].",0
"Few case reports have suggested an interaction between season or latitude and psychological problems [28,29].",0
"In a study by Mozaffari- Khosravi et al., high doses of vitamin D have been effective in men and women who were depressed [30].",0
suggested that more accurate clinical trials are required to reach a conclusion about the effectiveness of vitamin D on depression [31].,0
"Considering the possible connection between low serum vitamin D and depression, researchers studied the relationship between low vitamin D and perinatal depression.",0
"in a study with a small sample size (97\xa0participants), observed an association between maternal low serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and high depression scores within several post-partum visits [32].",0
studied the relationship between the maternal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations measured in the 18thweek of gestation and postnatal depression in 796 people.,0
They found that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in the second trimester were a risk factor for postnatal depression.,0
studied the association between maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and antenatal depression.,0
It has been shown that mothers with higher depression scores had lower levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D compared to who had lower depression scores [34].,0
"On the contrary to the above mentioned studies, Neilson et al., in a case–control study, found that an increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D level can enhance the possibility of postnatal depression.",0
"They have stated that, these unexpected results could be due to genetic differences which lead to a disturbance in conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D into its active form, calcitriol [35].",0
"According to our knowledge, there was no clinical trial that has evaluated the effectiveness of vitamin D on perinatal depression.",0
"Hence, we aimed this study to assess the effectiveness of vitamin D3supplementation on antenatal and postnatal depression levels.",0
Advantage of this questionnaire is that it focuses on psychological signs of depression rather than physical signs [36].,0
"After that, several studies have validated its use throughout the antenatal period [37–39].",0
"In western studies, this questionnaire has had high reliability and validity [40,41].",0
"Cut-off points with values more than 9, 12, 13, and 14 were used in different studies to determine perinatal depression [37,43,44].",0
"In the present study, we used the cut-off point of\u2009>\u200913 as greater likelihood of having depression disorder, according to Mazhari and Nakhaee’s study in Iranian population [42].",0
"Therefore, at baseline we excluded those mothers with the EPDS scores of >13 and they were referred to a psychologist for further evaluation and management.",0
The cut-off points of <9 and 9–13 were used as low and moderate risk for depression.,0
"According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), we considered vitamin D deficiency as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of less than 20\xa0ng/ml.",0
"We also considered vitamin D insufficiency as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of 21–29\xa0ng/ml, and the participants who had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of\u2009≥\u200930\xa0ng/ml as sufficient [19,46].",0
"Intervention in the supplement consumer (vitamin D) group: In 2007 and 2010, the Canadian Pediatric Association recommended a daily amount of 2000\xa0IU of vitamin D for pregnant and breast-feeding women [47,46].",0
"Therefore, this group received two 1000 unit vitamin D3pills (Totally 2000\xa0IU) daily from the 26–28 weeks of gestation until childbirth.",0
"In Iran, iron and folic acid supplements are routinely given to all pregnant mothers and some mothers based on doctors’ order may consume multivitamins or calcium.",0
The multivitamin supplementations contained 200–400\xa0IU of vitamin D.\n\nSample size and statistical analysis\nWe could not find a similar study to use its means for determining the sample size.,0
"Therefore, considering the following values: effect size\u2009=\u20090.5, α\u2009=\u20090.05, β\u2009=\u20090.20, to the power of 80\xa0% and using the formula (16/∆2, ∆\u2009=\u20090.05), the sample size was estimated at 64 in each group.",0
"Considering the possible losses, the sample size was set at 74 people in each group finally.",0
We conducted stratified analyses by parity status to assess whether the trend of effectiveness is different among the two nulliparous and multiparous subgroups.,0
16/169 women did not refer to the lab.,0
Another significant factor for sample loss was that a number of the women did not return to the specified hospital for childbirth.,0
"However, they were different regarding to using other supplements outside the study’s protocol and planned pregnancy (Table\xa01).",0
"Only, 4 women (2.2\xa0%) were sufficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration of ≥\u200930\xa0ng/mL).",0
"While, the mean depression scores were significantly lower in the vitamin D group than the control one at 38–40 weeks of gestation ( p \u2009=\u20090.01) also, at 4 and 8 weeks after birth ( p \u2009>\u20090.001) (Table\xa03).",0
"Results showed that in the vitamin D group the number of participants with depression scores of <9 were more than the control group at 38–40 weeks of gestation also, at 4 and 8 weeks after birth (Table\xa03).",0
The repeated measures analysis showed that the control group had gone through significant changes with regards to depression scores ( p \u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.,0
"However, the scores at 4 and 8 weeks after birth were lower than the baseline depression scores (( p \u2009=\u20090.048 and p \u2009=\u20090.014, respectively).",0
"2\n\nWithin groups comparison related to depression scores: The results showed, between the two groups, the difference regards to over-time reduction of depression scores was significant ( p \u2009<\u20090.001)\nThe vitamin D group also had gone through changes with regards to their depression scores ( p \u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.",0
"Pairwise comparisons showed that the scores at 38–40 weeks, 4 and 8 weeks postpartum were significantly lower than the baseline depression scores ( p \u2009<\u20090.001).",0
"However, the depression scores at 4 and 8 weeks after birth were not different significantly ( p \u2009=\u20090.217).",0
"The results showed that in both subgroups, the vitamin D group had statistically significant higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations at childbirth and lower depression score at 4 and 8 weeks postpartum than the control group (Table\xa04).",0
"While, any statistically significant differences were not observed regarding to depression scores at 38–40 weeks of gestation (Table\xa04).",0

Discussion\nThis clinical trial evaluated the effect of 2000\xa0IU of vitamin D3supplement per day during late pregnancy on perinatal depression.,0
"According to our knowledge, this study was the first trial held on vitamin D and perinatal depression.",0
"Results showed that at baseline, in 72.8\xa0% of the participants, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were lower than20 ng/mL.",0
They were suffering from vitamin D deficiency based on new perspective towards normal serum vitamin D concentration [46].,0
"Although 67.3\xa0% of the blood samples were taken in the winter, 81\xa0% of the participants were exposed to sunlight or had outdoor activities for at least 15\xa0min per day.",0
"Considering the factors affecting vitamin D production such as clothing type, skin color and the time of day being exposed to the sun [48–50], these results are justifiable.",0
"Vitamin D deficiency is a widespread global problem, which even can observe in the countries which get enough sunlight [49,51].",0
The high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Iran was showed in numerous studies.,0
"Saki et al., showed high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in southern Iranian children, more than 80\xa0% were deficient [53].",0
"found vitamin D deficiency in 52.9\xa0% of women aged 20–74 years in Shiraz, Iran [54].",0
"In the present study, the mean vitamin D concentrations in vitamin D group were significantly higher after taking 2000\xa0IU of vitamin D supplementation per day for at least 8 weeks.",0
"Nonetheless, only 9.7\xa0% in the vitamin D group achieved serum concentrations higher than 30\xa0ng/mL.",0
"In contrast, in the previous studies 2000\xa0IU vitamin D supplementation was more sufficient to increase serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations up to the adequate amount (≥32\xa0ng/mL) [18,57,58].",0
"In those studies, vitamin D supplementations started at the end of the first trimester or at the beginning of the second trimester and their participants had higher initial 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations compared to the participants in our study.",0
"Therefore, it is justifiable that in our study, vitamin D group had lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration compared to those were in the study by Taheri et al.",0
"Considering cut-off point of ≥9, data analysis showed that a lot of participants (more than 50\xa0%) were susceptible to prenatal depression at 26–28 weeks.",0
"In previous studies, the prevalence of antenatal depression had been studied, using various tools and cut-off points.",0
"Depression was reported in 8.6\xa0% of European mothers, in 19.5\xa0% of Middle Eastern mothers, and in 17.5\xa0% of South Asian mothers.",0
"However, the EPDS has been widely used in screening, not providing a diagnosis, for perinatal depression, it has been reported that its score is highly correlated with physician diagnostic opinion.",0
"Several studies have been shown that, with cutoff score of 12–13, this scale develops into more indicative in identifying real depression in women [36,37,42].",0
"The participants who had depression scores of >13 were exited from this clinical trial and referred to psychiatrist for further assessment and treatment, because, the nature of our study was preventative than management.",0
"While in a study by Cassidy- Bushrow et al., in African-American women, an inverse relationship was observed between maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration at the early stages of pregnancy and antenatal depression.",0
"There was an inverse relationship between the vitamin D logarithm and depression scores, as by adding one unit to the vitamin D concentration logarithm, equal to 2.72\xa0ng/mL, a 46\xa0% reduction in the depression scores occurred [63].",0
"In another study in US, in 498 pregnant mothers with the mean gestational age of 15\xa0weeks, generally there was an inverse relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and depression level.",0
It is worth mentioning that their tools for determining depression were different than ours.,0
It was a possible reason that we did not observe any relationship between antenatal depression score and 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration.,0
"Also in our study, selection of participants at the beginning was through convenience method.",0
"Surprisingly, the change in vitamin D concentration (baseline to childbirth) was not correlated with changes in depression scores from baseline to 38–40 weeks of gestation or to 4 and 8 weeks postpartum.",0
The present trial showed that consuming 2000\xa0IU vitamin D3per day in late pregnancy was effective in decreasing depression scores in perinatal period.,0
The vitamin D and control groups were similar regarding to general characteristics except for two variables: unplanned pregnancy and using other supplements out of the study’s protocol.,0
Previous studies reported that unplanned pregnancy is a risk factor for perinatal depression.,0
"Nonetheless, in our study, the vitamin D group had significantly lower depression scores after intervention.",0
The effectiveness of calcium supplementation on prevention of perinatal depression has been shown in a previous study [65].,0
"The control group consumed extra supplements such as calcium more frequently, nonetheless this group had significantly higher depression scores compared to vitamin D group.",0
"Previous clinical trials, in which vitamin D supplementations were consumed during pregnancy [18,58], have not evaluated the antenatal and postnatal depression disorders.",0
"However in a cross-sectional study in Japan, higher dietary vitamin D intake was independently associated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy [66].",0
"On the other hand, the effect of vitamin D on depression in non-pregnant people are not entirely clear.",0
Some clinical trials in non-pregnant people showed that vitamin D was effective in decreasing depression level.,0
"In a study by Mozafari- Khosravi et al., 300,000 and 150,000\xa0IU vitamin D were administered by injection to the two groups who suffered depression and the third group did not receive vitamin D. High doses of vitamin D were effective in decreasing depression levels after 3\xa0months [30].",0
"In contrast, in another study 40,000\xa0IU vitamin D per week was used for 6\xa0months, but vitamin D was not effective in decreasing depression level compared to the control group [68].",0
found that 5000\xa0IU vitamin D per day for 6\xa0weeks had no effect on men and women’s cognitive and emotional function [69].,0
Vitamin D can affect brain function in several ways.,0
"The existence of receptors for the active form of vitamin D (1, 25(OH)2D) in the brain induces a direct effect.",0
Its indirect effects are attributed to vitamin D’s effects on improvement of muscle activities.,0
"As a result of this improvement, physical activity increases and this have positive effects on health.",0
An increase in vitamin D can cause parathyroid hormones to decrease.,0
"An increase in this hormone can lead to brain dysfunctions [70,71].",0
"On the other hand, cytokines are messengers produced by immune cells which affect all tissues, including brain.",0
"Nowadays, we know that brain cells such as microglia and astrocytes, can secrete cytokines.",0
Vitamin D may act as an anti-inflammatory agent in the brain by keeping harmful pro-inflammatory cytokines in check.,0
Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to pro-inflammatory disease.,0
"It is also possible that as a result of vascular changes in pregnancy the maternal cerebral environment is more vulnerable to inflammation perhaps, explaining in part the link between vitamin D and depression in pregnancy.",0
"In light of the inflammatory nature of depression and the strong role of vitamin D as an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulator, inflammation may mediate the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and depression during pregnancy [73,74].",0
"Previous studies have suggested that perinatal depression is more frequent and serious in primiparous women than multiparous women [75,76].",0
It was interesting to investigate trend of vitamin D effectiveness in the two primiparous and multiparous subgroups.,0
The findings were similar to the overall population except one thing.,0
Staying on vitamin D consumption until childbirth resulted in higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration that induced the effect on postnatal depression exceeding than prenatal depression.,0
A difference in nature of antenatal depression compared to postnatal depression can reflect another possible reason for achieving this result.,0
Depression scores decreased in the both our groups over time which indicates that depression could be more critical during pregnancy than postpartum period.,0
The pleasant feeling of motherhood can probably play a role in decreasing depression specially in primiparous mothers [77].,0
"During pregnancy, women are worried about risks to their own and the fetus health.",0
Fear of labor pain is another concern of the modern-day mothers [78].,0
"Therefore, a decreased perinatal depression level is justifiable.",0
"On the other hand, the difference between the two groups was meaningful concerning over-time reduction of depression.",0
"Meaning that over time, depression scores decreased much more in the vitamin D group in comparison to control group and this shows the possible effects of the vitamin D3supplementation.",0
Another finding of this study was that vitamin D3supplementation was effective in decreasing depression level in both nulliparous and multiparous subgroups.,0
"Therefore, the participants’ honesty was one of this research limits.",0
This group of participants may not be representative of the target population.,0
"Since mothers with depression level of >13 were excluded from this study, the results can not extend to mothers with high levels of depression.",0
"Also, since more than 95\xa0% of the mothers had lower than 30\xa0ng/mL serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration, it is not clear if the same results would be observed in mothers with higher levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Therefore, we suggest further clinical trials, using 2000\xa0IU vitamin D on a larger population, mothers with high levels of depression, and high serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations.",0
"The last weakness of this study was that it had the statistical authority to identify differences in depressive symptoms, but not in the diagnoses of major depressive disorder.",0
"Conclusion\nIn the present study, it was observed that 2000\xa0IU vitamin D3per day for at least 8 weeks during late pregnancy, can be effective in decreasing perinatal depression levels (at 38–40 weeks of gestation also, at 4 and 8 weeks after birth).",0
"Environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity: potential public health concerns\n\nAbstractAbstract\nThroughout our lives, epigenetic processes shape our development and enable us to adapt to a constantly changing environment.",0
Identifying and understanding environmentally induced epigenetic change(s) that may lead to adverse outcomes is vital for protecting public health.,0
"This review, therefore, examines the present understanding of epigenetic mechanisms involved in the mammalian life cycle, evaluates the current evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity in human cohorts and rodent models and highlights the research considerations and implications of this emerging knowledge for public health and regulatory toxicology.",0
"Many hundreds of studies have investigated such toxicity, yet relatively few have demonstrated a mechanistic association among specific environmental exposures, epigenetic changes and adverse health outcomes in human epidemiological cohorts and/or rodent models.",0
"While this small body of evidence is largely composed of exploratory in vivo high-dose range studies, it does set a precedent for the existence of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity.",0
"Consequently, there is worldwide recognition of this phenomenon, and discussion on how to both guide further scientific research towards a greater mechanistic understanding of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity in humans, and translate relevant research outcomes into appropriate regulatory policies for effective public health protection.",0
Introduction\nThe belief that the sequence of our DNA (our genome) is the sole determinant of our life-long development and health has long been regarded as too simplistic.,0
"Darwin’s ‘On the Origin of the Species’ highlighted the role of the environment in the process of evolution, the natural selection of advantageous genetic mutations through environmental pressures (Darwin1859).",0
It has also been recognized that the pace of such change is sometimes too rapid to be accounted for by natural selection.,0
"First Lamarck, and then Waddington, suggested that alternative mechanisms, now termed epigenetics, must also contribute to phenotypic outcomes (Noble2006).",0
"It is the complex interaction among our genome, epigenome and environment that shapes our development into unique individuals, and thus influences our health and potentially the health of our future offspring.",0
"The induction of adverse DNA mutations by environmental factors that lead to disease, particularly cancer, is well established and recognized by regulatory bodies worldwide.",0
"There are, however, no current established regulatory procedures or guidelines in chemical safety programs for determining environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity.",0
"We, therefore, wanted to examine both the potential public health concerns and the resulting regulatory implications of such toxicity.",0
"These were then further evaluated and collated to provide a critical review that summarizes the main epigenetic mechanisms important during the mammalian life cycle, evaluates the current evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity in human cohorts and rodents models, and highlights the research considerations and implications of this emerging knowledge for public health and regulatory toxicology.",0
"[""Environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity is an issue that has been highlighted as a current research focus within Public Health England’s (PHE's) Center for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards (CRCE), the wider PHE organization as part of the early life priority ‘ensuring every child has the best start in life’, and the international research and governmental communities.""]",0
"By identifying and contributing to the knowledge gaps PHE, and similar organizations worldwide, can ensure that they stay fully aware of the current situation and are in the best position to give advice and put forward any necessary recommendations and policies to protect public health against such toxicity.",0
"Methylation at CGIs is generally associated with transcriptional repression, although the local CpG density within a specific promoter can contribute to the actual transcriptional effect (Hackett & Surani2013; Messerschmidt et\xa0al.2014).",0
Much less is known about the mechanisms of DNA demethylation.,0
It has long been suggested that 5mC can be removed by both passive (through lack of maintenance during replication) and active (enzymatic) mechanisms.,0
"Yet, specific DNA demethylase enzyme(s) in mammals remained elusive until the discovery of the 10–11 translocation (TET) enzyme family.",0
"This family, which can oxidize 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and further to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxycytosine (5caC) (Tahiliani et\xa0al.2009; Ito et\xa0al.2011), has fueled research into indirect active DNA demethylation pathways.",0
"Consequently, a range of mechanisms for the demethylation of DNA have been proposed (described in relation to mammalian development in Dean2014; Messerschmidt et\xa0al.2014; Messerschmidt,2016).",0
It was widely believed that these 20–30\u2009000 protein-coding genes were the sole mediators and executors of all cellular functions.,0
The remaining 95–99% of the genome was regarded as ‘junk’ DNA.,0
"However, a functional role for ncDNA was inferred from the strong correlation between increasing ncDNA abundance and increasing organism complexity (Mattick2007).",0
"Indeed, over the last decade, the previous gene-centric dogma, central to molecular biology, has been shown to be incorrect.",0
"[""All these mechanisms play critical roles throughout normal mammalian development, particularly during early embryo and germ cell development (Cook & Blelloch2013; Beaujean2014; Dean2014; Hale et\xa0al.2014; Luk et\xa0al.2014; Messerschmidt et\xa0al.2014; Mukherjee et\xa0al.2014; O'Doherty & McGettigan2014; Grote & Herrmann2015; Hogg & Western2015; Marcho et\xa0al.2015).""]",0
"As with any rapidly developing field, there is a continuous generation of new information that must be incorporated as appropriate, such as novel histone or DNA modifications and ncRNAs families implicated in the epigenetic regulation of the mammalian life cycle (Dean2014; Hale et\xa0al.2014; Messerschmidt et\xa0al.2014; Sun et\xa0al.2014; Garcia-Lopez et\xa0al.2015; Sharma et\xa0al.2016); and new functions for existing epigenetic mechanisms within mammalian development (Gou et\xa0al.2014; Kuramochi-Miyagawa et\xa0al.2008; Watanabe et\xa0al.2008,2011; Li et\xa0al.2015, Pantano et\xa0al.2015; Williams et\xa0al.2015; Zhang et\xa0al.2015).",0
"Such epigenetic processes can be perturbed by environmental factors, potentially leading to an adverse phenotypic outcome.",0
"It is worth noting that some genomic regions escape this first global ‘reset’, including imprinted control regions (ICRs) and the most active TEs.",0
"The placenta and brain, in particular, express many of the imprinted genes, in keeping with experimentally identified roles for imprinted genes in prenatal nutrient acquisition and growth regulation, neurodevelopment, and postnatal energy homeostasis and behavior.",0
"It is, therefore, vital for normal embryo development that these imprints are maintained during the first global epigenetic re-programing event.",0
"Similarly, the activation of TEs would be deleterious for the embryonic genome and so the continued silencing of such loci through early embryogenesis is essential for genome stability and subsequent normal development.",0
It is essential for the generation of subsequent germ cells (and thus the successful production of future generations) that parental imprints within PGCs are removed and new imprints are re-established according to the gender of the embryo.,0
The mechanisms protecting specific genomic regions from epigenetic re-programing are not yet well-understood.,0
"However, some recent insights are presented and discussed in Hatanaka et\xa0al.",0
"Thus, a similar sncRNA switch, this time back to increased genome protection makes functional sense.",0
"Finally, it is important to note that histone modifications, DNA methylation and ncRNAs are not separate processes; they are closely linked throughout mammalian development.",0
"Thus, all the machinery involved in these pathways, including DNA and RNA binding and modifying proteins, are epigenetically important.",0
"While such complex networks exist to maintain cellular homeostasis, they are open to environmental perturbation (Figure 1).",0
"Indeed, numerous environmental factors have been shown to induce epigenetic changes via a variety of mechanisms.",0
"These include both direct and indirect processes that ultimately lead to alterations in DNA methylation, histone modification and/or ncRNA expression.",0
Both chemically induced DNA adducts and those generated as a consequence of reactive oxygen species damage resulting from chemical exposure can interfere with the ability of epigenetic machinery to interact with DNA (Baccarelli & Bollati2009; Ruiz-Hernandez et\xa0al.2015).,0
"Reactive oxygen species are also proposed to stimulate the production of alpha-ketoglutarate, a co-substrate for TETs and one of the two main classes of histone demethylases (Chervona & Costa2012; Ruiz-Hernandez et\xa0al.2015).",0
Additional epigenetic mechanisms are likely to be elucidated as research continues.,0
"It is when these environmentally induced perturbations exceed the capacity of the cell to maintain homeostasis that epigenetic toxicity occurs, potentially leading to altered phenotypes and adversely impacting public health.",0
"Even in adulthood the same epigenetic processes drive cell proliferation, differentiation, function and adaptation.",0
"Environmentally induced epigenetic changes later in life can, therefore, also influence an individual’s health.",0
"Indeed, numerous adult onset diseases have been associated with abnormal epigenetic changes, including cancer, diabetes, and neurological, renal, cardiac and respiratory conditions (Hamm & Costa2015); and epigenetic processes play a key role in initiating the onset of puberty, changes to which can also increase the risk of some of these adult onset diseases (Rzeczkowska et\xa0al.2014).",0
"However, certain stages in development and cell types can be thought of as particularly sensitive to epigenetic change due to the resulting severity of the outcome for the individual or the potential for affecting multiple generations.",0
Early life\nEarly embryo and germ line development can be affected by in utero exposures.,0
Environmentally induced epigenetic changes during the vital first developmental re-programing and programing event could result in incorrect erasure and/or re-establishment of the embryo epigenome.,0
"This could lead to activation of TEs, and abnormal imprinting and gene expression.",0
"Such changes could have far-reaching consequences on embryo viability and development (including early germ line formation), and thus subsequent future health and fertility.",0
"It is also important to consider, however, early ex utero exposures.",0
"Early childhood and adolescence are also periods of significant growth and development, so it is easy to envisage how environmentally induced epigenetic changes during these stages could have detrimental effects on future health and fertility.",0
"Gametogenesis and pre-conception\nSpermatogenesis occurs continuously in adult males and even though females are born with their full complement of oocytes, oocyte maturation occurs in a continuous cycle throughout the reproductive life of adult females.",0
"Thus, environmental exposures to those oocytes and spermatozoa that go onto produce an embryo (pre-conception exposures) are also an important consideration.",0
"Environmentally induced epigenetic changes in the sperm or egg prior to conception could, therefore, affect embryo viability and development and the subsequent future health and fertility of the next generation.",0
"Indeed, murine spermatozoal miRNAs and/or esiRNAs have been shown to function in fertilization and early embryo development (Liu et\xa0al.2012,2016; Yuan et\xa0al.2016), and to influence phenotypic outcomes in subsequent progeny (Rassoulzadegan et\xa0al.2006; Wagner et\xa0al.2008; Grandjean et\xa0al.2009).",0
"Moreover, subsequent studies have further demonstrated that early life trauma or parental stress can induce altered miRNA expression in sperm, which in turn can transmit behavioral and metabolic abnormalities through to the next murine generation (Rodgers et\xa0al.2013; Gapp et\xa0al.2014; Rodgers et\xa0al.2015).",0
"It is also worth noting that some of these RNA-mediated phenotypes have been shown to be dependent upon the remaining member of the DNMT family, DNMT2 (Kiani et\xa0al.2013).",0
"Although DNMT2 has demonstrated some weak DNMT activity, it is predominantly associated with RNA, particularly tRNA, methylation, potentially contributing to the regulation of RNA stability and translation (Motorin et\xa0al.2010).",0
"Somatic versus germ cell change\nIf an epigenetic change occurs in a somatic cell or in a germ cell that is correctly ‘reset’ during germ line development in the subsequent offspring, then only one generation will be affected.",0
"However, if an epigenetic change becomes permanently established in the germ line, it will be transmitted across future generations, even in the absence of the original stimulus.",0
"Recent data has extended this list to include specific regions not associated with TEs that are preferentially located within CGIs, enhancers, promoters and gene bodies (Seisenberger et\xa0al.2012; Hackett et\xa0al.2013; Tang et\xa0al.2015).",0
"These both provide evidence that DNA methylation can be stably inherited, and highlight specific loci protected from global epigenetic erasure that could be involved in transmitting epigenetic information across generations.",0
"These retained histones are not randomly distributed throughout the male genome, they are particularly enriched at the promoters of developmental genes.",0
"Thus, spermatozoal chromatin may also transmit unique epigenetic information that helps to activate and regulate early embryo development and contribute to epigenetic inheritance across multiple generations.",0
This so-called transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is a hotly debated topic.,0
Much of the controversy is concerned with multigenerational versus transgenerational epigenetic toxicity (or epigenetic effect(s) versus epigenetic inheritance) (Figure 3).,0
"If an environmental exposure is truly transgenerational, then: (1) following an in utero exposure the resulting change penetrates to at least the F3generation (great-great grandchildren), where F0is the exposed mother and F3represents the first non-exposed generation; or (2) following an ex utero exposure in childhood/adulthood the resulting change penetrates to at least the F2generation (the great-grandchildren), where F0is the exposed generation and F2represents the first non-exposed generation.",0
A transgenerational change thus represents epigenetic inheritance.,0
"Conversely, a multigenerational change represents an epigenetic effect that affects multiple generations, all of which were exposed to the original stimulus, either directly as the exposed mother or child/adult or indirectly as an embryo or PGC within the exposed generation.",0
"With respect to public health, however, this is mere semantics; both could have far-reaching consequences for the present and future health of human populations.",0
It is not necessarily important whether an environmental exposure induces adverse outcomes in multiple exposed or non-exposed generations.,0
The fact that it may cause epigenetic toxicity in any generation makes it relevant to public health.,0
"Penetration of adverse effect(s) to the first non-exposed generation (the F3generation following in utero exposure, or the F2generation following ex utero exposure) represents true epigenetic inheritance and thus transgenerational toxicity.",0
"Adverse effect(s) that affect multiple generations, all of which were exposed either directly or indirectly to the original factor represent epigenetic effect(s) and thus multigenerational toxicity.",0
"Current evidence for putative environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity\n\nHuman cohorts\nFor many decades, there have been epidemiological studies linking the risks of adverse phenotypes to a wide range of environmental factors.",0
"For example, pre-conception, in utero or childhood undernutrition have been associated with an increased risk of developing various adult-onset diseases, including psychiatric disorders, type 2 diabetes and obesity, in numerous famine cohorts such as the Dutch Hunger Winter, the Chinese Great Leap Forward and the Överkalix cohorts (Lumey et\xa0al.2011; Pembrey et\xa0al.2014).",0
"Likewise, metabolic syndromes, hormonal perturbation, reduced sperm quality and increased cancer risks have been associated with chemical and radiation exposures in the survivors of human disasters, including the Seveso dioxin release, the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs and the Chernobyl nuclear accident (Warner et\xa0al.2011,2013; Foley et\xa0al.2015; Kamiya et\xa0al.2015).",0
"In addition, large human cohorts that have recruited participants at birth for long-term follow up with comprehensive data and sample collection, such as the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort (Boyd et\xa0al.2013), provide a wealth of information to investigate epidemiological links between specific environmental exposures and public health outcomes.",0
"There have been over 1200 publications using data from ALSPAC (ALSPAC 2016), many of which have linked pre-conception and in utero environmental factors (including chemicals, pharmaceuticals, nutrition, smoking, anxiety and depression) with adverse outcomes (such as asthma and other respiratory disorders, increased weight/BMI-related issues and behavioral problems) (Golding2010; Boyd et\xa0al.2013).",0
"In particular, studies examining the parental and grandparental smoking status have demonstrated an interesting gender-specific association between paternal pre-conception or grandmaternal in utero exposure to cigarette smoke and increased weight-related issues in the subsequent sons and grandsons, but not daughters or granddaughters (Pembrey et\xa0al.2014).",0
"Gender-specific effects were also observed in a number of the famine cohorts, with an increased risk of obesity occurring in female descendants only (Lumey et\xa0al.2011; Pembrey et\xa0al.2014).",0
"The association of later life health with pre-conception, in utero or childhood environmental factors has led to the “Developmental Origins of Health and Disease” (DOHaD) hypothesis (Wadhwa et\xa0al.2009).",0
"The DOHaD hypothesis evolved from Barker’s “thrifty phenotype” hypothesis originally proposed over 25 years ago (reviewed in Barker2007), and was formed “to recognise….the concept that the early life environment has widespread consequences for later health” (Wadhwa et\xa0al.2009).",0
"This concept of phenotypic plasticity, particularly as a consequence of different environments in early life, implicates epigenetic mechanisms and has fueled research into environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity.",0
We therefore sought to review the existing literature (up to 7 March 2016) to evaluate the current evidence for such toxicity.,0
"These studies can be ranked into categories that demonstrate (1) associations between environmental exposure(s), global epigenetic change(s) and adverse phenotype(s); (2) associations between environmental exposure(s), specific epigenetic changes(s) and adverse phenotypes(s) (including further subcategories, such as size and nature of cohort, type of sample analyzed, use of case controls, dose- and/or time-dependent changes, single changes within relevant biological pathways, multiple changes within the same biological pathway, correlation of changes with gene expression at mRNA and/or protein level, use of additional mechanistically relevant controls, robust statistical analysis, validation in independent cohorts); or (3) associations between environmental exposure(s), specific epigenetic changes(s) and adverse phenotypes(s) that were confirmed in a relevant in vivo and/or in vitro system.",0
Studies falling into category 3 provide more comprehensive mechanistic evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity and are shown inTable 1.,0
"Specifically, these studies provide mechanistic associations between bisphenol A (BPA), formaldehyde, arsenic, nickel, or cigarette smoke, epigenetic changes and adverse phenotypes, and potential mechanisms of epigenetic toxicity in humans.",0
The smoking evidence is particularly compelling as it has been established by multiple independent groups investigating different epigenetic mechanisms.,0
"In addition, studies within categories 1 and 2 may also enable the identification of markers and/or mechanisms of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity through a weight of evidence approach (e.g.",0
"the same association(s) reported in multiple independent cohorts or multiple association(s) that contribute to the same biological pathway), and are, therefore, included in Supplementary Table 2.",0
Current evidence for putative environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity in human epidemiological cohorts.,0
(2014)\nOnly studies that measured both adverse phenotypes and associated epigenetic changes in response to an environmental exposure were reviewed.,0
"All the studies shown here demonstrated associations among environmental exposure(s), specific epigenetic changes(s) and adverse phenotypes(s) that were confirmed in a relevant in vivo and/or in vitro system.",0
"Furthermore, while human epidemiological cohort studies can demonstrate association, they do not prove causality.",0
"They are also complicated by the fact that the biological material under study, often blood cells, is not from the target organ/tissue.",0
"Interpretation of the findings with respect to mechanistic connections between environmental factors, epigenetic changes and adverse effects in the target organ/tissue can therefore be challenging.",0
"However, as stated above, all 10 of the studies shown inTable 1further confirmed identified associations between environmental exposures, specific epigenetic changes and adverse phenotypes in a relevant in vivo and/or in vitro system; and seven of the 10 studies either directly sampled the target tissue or validated the same change in the blood and target tissue of an appropriate in vivo model.",0
"As such, these studies are of greater mechanistic relevance, and provide more comprehensive evidence for putative causal relationships.",0
Rodent models\nThe deleterious effects of exposures to environmental factors in human cohorts have stimulated investigations of environmentally induced toxicity in rodent models.,0
"In the late 1990s/early 2000s, these studies began to associate adverse phenotypes resulting from environmental exposures with epigenetic mechanisms (Issa et\xa0al.1996; Tao et\xa0al.1998,1999; Choi et\xa0al.1999; Bielawski et\xa0al.2002; Govindarajan et\xa0al.2002; Chen et\xa0al.2004; Marwick et\xa0al.2004; Pulling et\xa0al.2004; Vuillemenot et\xa0al.2004; Wu et\xa0al.2004).",0
"demonstrated that in utero exposure to the environmental chemical vinclozolin (a fungicide used in the wine industry) reduced sperm quantity, quality and thus male fertility with a >90% penetrance through multiple generations (to at least the F4generation).",0
"The effect appeared to be transmitted through the male germ line, with altered DNA methylation patterns detected in the testes of the F1generation and the sperm of the F2and F3generations.",0
This was the first study to show phenotypic and epigenetic changes in generations not directly exposed to the original stimulus.,0
"As expected, this study generated some controversy, particularly when subsequent groups failed to reproduce the same results (Gray & Furr2008; Schneider et\xa0al.2008; Inawaka et\xa0al.2009; Schneider et\xa0al.2013).",0
These disparities may have been due to the use of different routes of administration and variations in rat strains/stocks.,0
"Nevertheless, over the ensuing decade the hundreds of subsequent studies have provided more evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity.",0
"We identified 147 rodent studies within PubMed (up to 7 March 2016) demonstrating both adverse phenotype(s) (such as reduced fertility, reproductive, developmental or other organ-specific abnormalities, or adult onset diseases (cancer, diabetes, obesity or immune disorders)) and epigenetic change(s) (histone modification, DNA methylation, epigenetic machinery or miRNAs) following exposure to environmental factor(s) (including chemicals, radiation or lifestyle factors (alcohol, nutrition, or smoking)) at various stages of development (pre-conception, in utero , neonatal, lactation, childhood, adolescence and adulthood).",0
"These studies can be ranked into categories that demonstrate (1) environmentally induced adverse phenotype(s) and global epigenetic change(s); (2) environmentally induced adverse phenotype(s) and specific epigenetic change(s) (including further subcategories, such as dose- and/or time-dependent changes, single changes within relevant biological pathways, multiple changes within the same biological pathway, correlation of changes with gene expression at mRNA and/or protein level, use of additional mechanistically relevant controls, robust statistical analysis); (3) environmentally induced adverse phenotype(s) and specific epigenetic change(s) that were reversed by an inhibitor/treatment, absent in a knock out/down model, and/or mechanistically linked in a relevant in vitro system; or (4) the same environmentally induced adverse phenotype(s) and specific epigenetic change(s) in both rodent model(s) and human cohort(s).",0
Studies falling into categories 3 and/or 4 provide more comprehensive mechanistic evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity and are shown inTable 2.,0
"In total, 18 of the 40 studies shown inTable 2validated loss of both epigenetic change(s) and adverse effect(s) following appropriate inhibition, treatment or knock out/down; thereby demonstrating a definitive causal link between exposure (largely high dose) to BPA, formaldehyde, cadmium, methylmercury, 2,3,7,8-tetra-chloro-dibenzo- p -dioxin (TCDD), urethane, vinyl carbamate, alcohol, caffeine, overnutrition, cigarette smoke, nicotine or 4-(methyl-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), epigenetic changes and adverse phenotypes.",0
"While the remaining studies do not necessarily demonstrate causality, they do provide additional mechanistic associations between exposure (again largely high dose) to BPA, formaldehyde, nickel, phthalates, TCDD, alcohol, undernutrition, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenyl-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), peanut, cigarette smoke, nicotine or NKK, epigenetic changes and adverse phenotypes.",0
"The BPA, TCDD, alcohol and smoking-related evidence is particularly compelling as it has been established by multiple independent groups investigating different epigenetic mechanisms.",0
"In addition, studies within categories 1 and 2 may also enable identification of markers and/or mechanisms of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity through a weight of evidence approach (e.g.",0
"the same epigenetic change(s) reported in multiple independent studies or multiple epigenetic changes that contribute to the same biological pathway), and, therefore, are included in Supplementary Table 3.",0
"While much of the work to date has focused on rodent models, there is also some evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity in other mammalian species, including sheep and monkeys (Wu et\xa0al.2008; Begum et\xa0al.2013; Lie et\xa0al.2014a,2014b).",0
Current evidence for putative environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity in rodent models.,0
(2010)*/‡\nOnly studies assessing both adverse phenotypes and associated epigenetic changes in response to an environmental exposure were reviewed.,0
"*Studies demonstrating environmentally-induced adverse phenotype(s) and specific epigenetic change(s) that were reversed by an inhibitor/treatment, absent in a knock out/down model, and/or mechanistically linked in a relevant in vitro system.",0
"†Studies validating loss of both epigenetic change(s) and adverse effect(s) following appropriate inhibition, treatment or knock out/down.",0
‡Studies demonstrating the same environmentally induced adverse phenotype(s) and specific epigenetic change(s) in both animal model(s) and human cohort(s).,0
¶Studies in which environmentally induced adverse phenotype(s) and epigenetic change(s) were reported in separate publications but were performed within the same experimental animals.,0
"Other exposures of environmental origin that have been extensively investigated in both human cohorts and rodent models include stress, recreational drugs, maternal immune activation/infection and parental age.",0
"While this large body of work also provides some comprehensive evidence for, and specific mechanisms of, epigenetic toxicity, it was considered outside the scope of this review.",0
"Likewise, pharmaceutical drug-induced epigenetic toxicity in human cohorts and rodent models has also been reported.",0
"However, such drugs are not environmental factors and so were not considered any further.",0
"Moreover, there were additional studies that have investigated environmentally induced epigenetic changes without simultaneously assessing any phenotypic/toxicological endpoints and/or focused on acute exposures (less than 24\u2009h).",0
"While such studies are more difficult to interpret with respect to epigenetic toxicity (and so were not included in this review), they may still provide useful mechanistic data.",0
It is important to note that not all environmentally induced adverse phenotypes have been associated with epigenetic changes.,0
"Indeed, 18 human cohort and 20 rodent studies within PubMed reported a lack of epigenetically related toxicity (Supplementary Table 4).",0
"These studies do not necessarily rule out an epigenetic mechanism of toxicity per se , but they do exclude a link between the specific epigenetic, exposure and/or adverse endpoints/markers investigated.",0
The literature also contains many in vitro studies investigating the role of specific epigenetic mechanisms in adverse outcomes induced by environmental exposures.,0
"In addition, concurrent in vivo and in vitro studies have improved our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the mammalian life cycle, including recent insights into early human development (Laird2013; Slieker et\xa0al.2015; Surani2015; Williams et\xa0al.2015), and epigenetic inheritance in simpler model systems such as Caenorhabditis elegans , Drosophilamelanogaster and Daniorerio (zebrafish) (Padilla et\xa0al.2014; Somer & Thummel2014; Williams et\xa0al.2014).",0
"Thus, although comparison and integration of these different human cohort, animal, and in vitro studies is complicated by the different doses, routes of administration, timings and lengths of exposures, the various strains, species, cell types or statistical methods used, and/or the specific adverse outcome(s) or marker(s) selected, the current evidence demonstrates a mechanistic association between specific environmental exposures, epigenetic changes and adverse health outcomes in human epidemiological cohorts and model systems.",0
More studies that incorporate some form of inhibition/treatment/cessation into the experimental design are vital for establishing whether or not an exposure truly represents an epigenetic toxicant.,0
"Although potentially complex, the use of a systems biology approach, incorporating genome-wide analysis at multiple levels (histone code, methylome, non-coding RNA expression, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome) would provide comprehensive analysis of epigenetic changes and associated phenotypic outcomes.",0
Subsequent identification of human relevant mechanisms of epigenetic toxicity can then be further validated as appropriate in smaller more focused studies.,0
The challenge now is to fully identify and investigate the specific functional epigenetic mechanisms and biological pathways relevant to humans so that the risk(s) of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity to public health can be properly assessed and addressed.,0
Research considerations for public health\nThere is no doubt that humans are exposed to a range of environmental factors during everyday life.,0
"However, to determine whether, or not, environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity is a real concern for public health there are a number of important considerations.",0
Mechanisms and model systems\nThe nature of the research means that studies in humans are mainly restricted to epidemiological cohorts.,0
These cohorts often have limited availability of appropriate biosample at appropriate collection windows (Bakulski & Fallin2014).,0
"Ex vivo or in vitro experiments on human embryonic tissue and cells are quite rightly restricted by ethics, and can only model a small part of the in vivo situation.",0
"Thus, the majority of whole system studies have been performed in animal models, predominantly rodents.",0
"While the rodent and human life cycles share many commonalities they do exhibit subtle differences, both with each other and other mammalian species (Kristensen et\xa0al.2013; Laird2013; Leitch et\xa0al.2013; Surani2015).",0
Such differences are of critical importance when considering mechanistic relevance to humans.,0
"Nevertheless, such work provides valuable data.",0
"The key is integrating and interpreting it correctly, in terms of differences/similarities at both the system ( in vitro versus in vivo ) and species (human versus non-human) levels.",0
"It is important to continue supplementing non-human models with human-derived data, incorporating new technologies to maximize data collection, and updating and re-evaluating current conclusions as novel information becomes available.",0
Priority questions: What are the detailed mechanism(s) that link a particular exposure to a specific adverse effect?,0
Do these mechanism(s) function in humans?,0
What are the potential human disease outcome(s)?,0
"Dose, route, metabolism, timing and mixtures of exposure\nWhether, or not, an environmental exposure elicits a response depends on a range of interacting variables, including dose, route of administration, metabolism and additional/pre-existing exposures (mixtures).",0
"Much of the animal studies to date on environmental chemicals have involved administration of high doses, many orders of magnitude above likely exposures in real human populations.",0
"Similarly, the first animal study to demonstrate that an in utero exposure could induce adverse phenotypes in subsequent generations administered the environmental chemical vinclozolin via the intraperitoneal route (Anway et\xa0al.2005).",0
"Not only is it unlikely that a human would receive this, or any, environmental exposure via the same route of administration, but also the way in which an exposure is administered determines its overall effect.",0
"Indeed, oral administration of vinclozolin to pregnant females (the likely route of administration for humans given that vinclozolin is a fungicide used in the wine industry) failed to induce any adverse phenotypes in subsequent generations (Schneider et\xa0al.2008).",0
"Thus, while it is important to fully characterize the hazard, further studies at doses and routes of administration similar to those found in humans are necessary for determining relevance to public health.",0
"It is worth noting, however, that establishing the actual level of human exposure to a particular factor and mimicking it in experimental models is not always easy.",0
Metabolism is another major factor that can determine the overall effect of an environmental exposure.,0
"Thus, metabolism of the parent environmental compound can vary greatly between models, resulting in the production of different types and levels of metabolites.",0
"It is, therefore, important to assess if the model system being used accurately replicates the in vivo human metabolic environment, and if not to conduct further studies using any additional appropriate metabolites.",0
The timing of an environmental exposure can also be a major contributing factor to the significance of the overall outcome.,0
"As discussed earlier, some life stages may be more susceptible than others to a particular exposure.",0
There was the assumption that in utero exposure represents the most vulnerable period in an individual’s life with respect to their future development.,0
"However, it is now becoming clear that pre-conception and postnatal exposures can also be detrimental to future health across multiple generations.",0
Multiple exposures at multiple life stages could be additive and/or cumulative.,0
"While a particular low-level exposure may have no adverse effects, multiple low-level exposures over multiple stages of life may induce adverse phenotypes.",0
"Thus, once individual exposures have been characterized, it may also be relevant to assess the effect of (1) mixtures of environmental exposures, (2) multiple lifetime exposures of single environmental exposures, and (3) multiple lifetime exposures of mixtures of environmental exposures.",0
"Priority questions : What dose(s) via what route(s) of administration are human populations actually exposed to, and what metabolite(s) are formed?",0
Do low-level exposures induce epigenetic toxicity?,0
Is any part of the life cycle particularly more sensitive to an exposure than others?,0
Are multiple exposures additive and/or cumulative?,0
Human variability\nIt is known that different strains of laboratory animals can respond very differently to the same environmental exposure.,0
Such differences are largely driven by diverse genetic backgrounds.,0
"Individual humans demonstrate substantial genetic differences and so an individual’s underlying genetics could have a huge effect on his/her susceptibility to a particular environmental exposure, depending on his/her metabolism, adaptability, gender, age, previous exposures, etc.",0
"Thus, not all humans will respond to an environmental exposure in the same way.",0
"Indeed, there are many examples in the literature of how single polymorphisms (SNPs) can affect the response of individuals and populations to different environmental exposures.",0
These include not only mutations that alter the function of gene products but also those that lead to changes in DNA methylation or miRNA binding sites.,0
Priority question : How can we identify particularly susceptible individuals or populations?,0
"This view of epigenetically mediated phenotypic plasticity falls into the realms of Lamarckian inheritance, the idea that an organism can pass on acquired characteristics to future offspring.",0
"The benefits of such inheritance are obvious and even Darwin himself proposed a hypothetical mechanism for the transmission of somatic tissue characteristics via the germ cells to subsequent generations, which he termed pangenesis (Darwin1868).",0
"Indeed, not all environmentally induced epigenetic changes have proved detrimental.",0
(2009) reported that calorie restriction during adolescence and young adulthood as a result of the Dutch Hunger Winter was associated with altered DNA methylation and reduced risk of colorectal cancer in later life.,0
(2015) described a protective effect of early ( in utero through lactation) exposure to dietary omega-3 fatty acids on neuroplasticity in rats that involved specific changes in DNA methylation.,0
Such benefits are not just limited to nutrition; advantageous chemically induced epigenetic changes have also been reported.,0
(2012) demonstrated a beneficial heritable histone modification-mediated reprograming of hepatic wound healing in male rats that reduced fibrotic scarring in the subsequent offspring of rats treated with the hepatotoxin carbon tetrachloride.,0
"In addition, it is possible to have adverse outcomes that are reversible.",0
"(2013) provided epidemiological data to support the benefits of smoking cessation, with DNA methylation-related colon cancer risk reverting back to that of non-smokers within 10 years of cessation.",0
"Thus, the reversibility of environmentally induced changes is also critically important when determining the true potential adversity of an environmental exposure.",0
"Such findings, both positive and negative, have been incorporated into UK governmental advice and recommendations (Boyd et\xa0al.2013).",0
"Furthermore, epigenetic changes may themselves have no consequences on gene expression (as demonstrated in a recent in vitro study by Ramos et\xa0al.",0
"Thus, environmentally induced epigenetic changes may not always be mechanistically involved in adverse effects; instead, they may act as markers of past exposures (Bakulski & Fallin2014), or represent adaptations involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis.",0
Such changes may still prove useful for regulatory purposes and also do not rule out the possibility of later onset effects.,0
"For example, robust epigenetic changes induced by environmental exposures in the absence of a phenotypic consequence essentially become the ‘new normal’ epigenome, which could have greater susceptibility to disease development and/or future exposures (as demonstrated in two in vivo rat models (Greathouse et\xa0al.2012; Wong et\xa0al.2015)).",0
Characterizing normal variation within the epigenome between non-disease states would provide valuable data to begin establishing limits of epignetic change above which cellular homeostasis fails and epigenetic toxicity is induced.,0
The considerable inter- and intra-human/mammalian variation combined with the vast number of potential epigenetic changes make this a very challenging task.,0
"However, defining the limits of normal variation for specific epigenetic changes of relevance would be a sensible and pragmatic starting point.",0
Priority questions : What is the ‘normal’ epigenome?,0
What are the real short- and/or long-term consequence(s) of environmentally induced epigenetic change(s)?,0
Implications for regulatory toxicology and intervention\nAll the previous considerations are vital for effective regulatory toxicology and potential intervention.,0
"A robust, dose-dependent, causal relationship among a specific environmental exposure, an epigenetic change and an adverse public health outcome is required to classify a chemical as an epigenetic toxicant.",0
"While a similar robust, dose-dependent relationship is also crucial to facilitate the development of testing methods for hazard assessment, relevant environmental regulation and/or appropriate medical intervention, establishing causality is not necessarily essential.",0
"Epigenetic changes that act as markers of exposure and/or predictors of future toxicity, but do not in themselves directly induce an adverse effect, may also be useful in risk assessment and intervention.",0
As yet there is no precedent for epigenetically mediated toxicity in chemical regulation.,0
"However, environmental exposures during critical windows of human development and subsequent non-genotoxic/epigenetic changes that may lead to later life adverse health outcomes (such as obesity, diabetes and cancer) across multiple generations continues to be of high concern for all the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries, the International Agency on Research for Cancer (IARC) and the European Commission (EFSA2013; Greally & Jacobs2013; Herceg et\xa0al.2013; OECD2014).",0
Epigenetics thus offers an opportunity for improved chemical regulation and public health protection.,0
"For example, epigenetic changes have the potential to provide (1) more sensitive/earlier end points of toxicity within existing regulatory test guidelines (TGs), (2) novel markers of exposure/predictors of future toxicity for the development of in vitro chemical screening assays and (3) novel end points of toxicities for which we are currently rarely able to conduct definitive regulatory testing due to animal welfare, cost and time considerations (such as non-genotoxic carcinogens, multigenerational toxicity and chronic low-dose exposures that impact health in later life).",0
"As such, epigenetics is high on the agenda of the OECD expert working group on an integrated approach to testing and assessment (IATA) for non-genotoxic carcinogens (NGTxC) and the OECD endocrine disrupters testing and assessment advisory group (EDTA AG) (Greally & Jacobs2013; Jacobs et\xa0al.2015).",0
"The interest of OECD member countries in epigenetics within the former expert group is particularly strong, where epigenetic mechanisms are playing a pivotal role in the development of tools for improved chemical safety assessment (Jacobs et\xa0al.2015).",0
"Thus, the incorporation of epigenetics within chemical regulation could ultimately reduce animal usage and the time and cost of chemical research and development, while simultaneously improving the protection of public health worldwide.",0
"The current body of evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity is predominantly a collection of human epidemiological data and exploratory in vivo high (often single) dose range studies, performed, not for regulatory purposes, but to investigate the theoretical potential and putative mechanisms of epigenetic toxicity in biological systems.",0
"Nevertheless, such studies have helped to identify putative markers and assays that may be useful for biomonitoring such exposures and toxicities, and testing the epigenetic toxicity potential of environmental exposures, respectively.",0
Those that may be of particular interest for development into regulatory strategies/procedures are presented inTables 1and2.,0
"A number of reporter mouse models, including the Agouti Avy , CabpIAP and AuxinFu , have also been used to investigate environmentally induced epigenetic changes in in vivo exploratory research (Dolinoy et\xa0al.2007; Waterland et\xa0al.2006; Rosenfeld2010).",0
The Avy model in particular has been put forward as a potential epigenetic toxicological tool (Dolinoy2008; Rosenfeld2010; Faulk et\xa0al.2013).,0
"However, the suitability of the Avy mouse as a true reporter model has since been questioned following both lack of reproducibility (Rosenfeld et\xa0al.2013), and the suggestion that it may possess a “thrifty” genotype, naturally predisposing offspring to a metabolic syndrome when food is plentiful, thus confounding results following environmental exposures (Greally & Jacobs2013).",0
"The AxinFu mouse may, therefore, represent a more promising reporter model in the development of regulatory toxicological assays for potential environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity.",0
"In addition, current OECD human health-related TGs have the potential for adaptation to incorporate adverse epigenetic endpoints (Greally & Jacobs2013).",0
"Inclusion of such endpoints as non-compulsory measurements would (1) encourage better use of existing studies by adding a valuable non-genotoxic/epigenetic component that is not currently included, (2) provide an extensive sample resource and (3) initiate the collection of epigenetic data in a regulatory context.",0
This would begin to address regulatory concerns and help to develop formal epigenetically relevant toxicity TGs.,0
Such an approach would also respect the 3Rs.,0
"An overview of the relevant TGs that could be explored for adaptation (updated from Greally & Jacobs2013), is provided inTable 3.",0
These include not only the in vitro endocrine TGs and in vivo reproductive and developmental TGs (Greally & Jacobs2013) but also a newly revised genotoxicity TG (TG 483) where spermatogonal samples could be further utilized for RNA analyzes (Linschooten et\xa0al.2009; Marczylo et\xa0al.2012; Metzler-Guillemain et\xa0al.2015).,0
"The potential for such adaptations is already acknowledged at the OECD, but more applied development of key markers and subsequent validation work is needed to formally incorporate epigenetic endpoints into TGs.",0
Similar discussions on the incorporation of epigenetic toxicity into the regulatory framework are also a current focus of industry supported workshops (van Ravenzwaay et\xa0al.2014; ECETOC2016; Miousse et\xa0al.2015).,0
"Current OECD human health related TGs that have the potential for adaptation to include epigenetic endpoints.Type of studyTGsDescriptionGeneral exposure studiesTG 451Carcinogenicity studies\xa0TG 452Chronic toxicity studies\xa0TG 453Combined chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity studiesPost-mitotic cell studiesTG 424Neurotoxicity study in rodentsPrenatal effectsTG 414Prenatal development toxicity study\xa0TG 426Developmental neurotoxicity studyReproductive effectsTGs 415, 416One- and two-generation reproduction toxicity\xa0TG 421(Revised) Reproduction/developmental toxicity screening test\xa0TG 422(Revised) Combined repeated dose toxicity study with the reproduction/developmental toxicity screening test\xa0TG 443Extended one-generation reproductive toxicity studyGenotoxicity testsTG 483(Revised 2015) Mammalian spermatogonial chromosome aberration testAlternative models integrating multiple \u2003mechanisms of toxicityTG 236 -Zebrafish embryo epigenetic toxicity assay Xenopus Embryo Thyroid Assay (XETA Assay) (in validation)\nUpdated from Greally and Jacobs (2013).",0
"When considering temporal aspects to reproductive, developmental and endocrine disrupting effects, the TGs currently in use may not incorporate either the most relevant life stage(s), the most sensitive endpoints for epigenetic perturbation and/or sufficient duration of observation to detect later-onset effects.",0
"Thus, it is likely that the full spectrum of potential effects will not be identified.",0
"While some tests in the OECD Conceptual Framework do cover exposure during critical periods of development in utero , to date, they may not address effects that might be induced by exposure during neonatal or pubertal development, and/or emerge during later life stages.",0
"For regulatory purposes, there are major limitations to simply extending lifetime rodent studies beyond the standard 2 years to examine later-onset epigenetic adverse outcomes, including financial, ethical and scientific considerations.",0
"In addition to the increased costs and animal welfare issues associated with housing and monitoring up to the natural death of the animals, there is also the confounding factor of increased background pathology with age.",0
"Infectious pathologies and increased incidences of certain tumor types, such as pituitary tumors or lymphomas/leukaemias, are known to occur with increasing age, and the high spontaneous incidences of leukemias/lymphomas and mammary gland tumors in laboratory animals from inbred colonies are known to vary considerably between studies (Innes et\xa0al.1967; Greaves2000).",0
"Thus, an overview of non-neoplastic, pre-neoplastic, neoplastic and benign pathologies within each model system is essential for the accurate interpretation of life-long rodent studies.",0
"Such overviews are, however, rarely included in the relevant literature associated with extended lifetime studies.",0
"Consequently, these studies are rarely considered acceptable to many regulatory authorities and are not specifically requested for ethical reasons, the numbers of animals needed to ensure appropriate statistical power would be both unworkable, and unethical.",0
"There are other more time and financially economical ways in which lifetime, multigenerational and/or transgenerational toxicity could be assessed, for example using zebrafish models, both respecting the 3Rs and satisfying sufficient statistical power.",0
"Already widely used in the pharmaceutical industry for developmental toxicity screening, zebrafish models appear to be a promising alternative to mice.",0
"Furthermore, it is also important to consider the broader repercussions of regulatory toxicology.",0
"Of course, it is vital that any environmental toxicant is carefully regulated or even banned from use.",0
"However, the situation is often not as straightforward as this.",0
"For example, chemicals can have far-reaching benefits to society, from agriculture to medicine and food/product safety to the development of new technologies.",0
Regulations are frequently a fine balance between maximizing the ‘modern life’ benefits of an environmental chemical while minimizing any potential adverse effects.,0
"This is where dose/level of exposure and relevance to humans is crucial, but considerations of alternative replacements are also important.",0
Do we run the risk of banning a chemical that does not demonstrate any epigenetic toxicity at the levels found within the environment or human populations only to replace it with an alternative whose characteristics and potential effects we know even less about?,0
"Surely, it is better for both society and public health to fully assess the potential epigenetic effects of environmental exposures and introduce regulations and TGs based on relevant data and proven mechanisms of toxicity.",0
"Conclusions\nDespite the fact that the seminal work on environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity was published over a decade ago, this area of research largely remains in its infancy, striving to elucidate putative mechanisms of epigenetic toxicity and identify mechanistic associations in human cohorts.",0
"This might well be expected since the fundamental idea that environmental factors can induce phenotypic changes across multiple generations challenges the central dogma of genetic inheritance, moving into what was a controversial area of genetics, but is now better accepted and established, Lamarckism.",0
"While many hundreds of studies have investigated environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity, relatively few (47 to-date) have demonstrated a mechanistic association among specific environmental exposures, epigenetic changes and adverse phenotypes.",0
"Even fewer (18 of the 47 to-date) further established causality, all of which were studies in rodent models.",0
"Moreover, the majority of these 47 studies represent exploratory in vivo high (often single) dose range experiments, many orders of magnitude above likely human exposures.",0
"Nevertheless, they do set a precedent for the existence of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity, and provide tools for linking environmental exposures to adverse health outcomes.",0
"Thus, although the current literature remains incomplete regarding specific mechanisms of epigenetically mediated environmentally induced toxicity in humans at doses relevant to human exposures, there is sufficient information to perform retrospective epigenetic analysis of existing regulatory studies and identify future research needs.",0
"For example, epigenetic mechanisms and markers identified within the 47 studies highlighted in this review could be further examined and potentially validated in existing regulatory studies.",0
"Improved human exposure data could be collected and used to facilitate the use of more relevant doses, routes of administration, metabolites and mixtures.",0
"Guidelines could be developed for improved molecular ( in vivo , in vitro and epidemiological) and bioinformatic study designs that incorporate suitable new technologies (such as omics platforms) and appropriate inhibitors/treatments/cessations (for exposure/change/effect validation) to definitively identify detailed epigenetic mechanisms that link, or act as markers of, environmental exposures and adverse health outcomes.",0
"Collaboration between scientists from academia, industry, and governmental and regulatory bodies will promote further research within a regulatory context, and drive the development and implementation of epigenetically relevant integrated testing strategies or policies for the continued protection of public health.",0
"Recurrent acral angioosteoma cutis in a pregnant patient\n\nIntroduction\nGooge et\xa0al in 2006 first described 11 cases of acral angioosteoma cutis (AAOC), characterized by benign vascular and osseous lesions on acral skin.1Since then, there have been only 3 additional cases reported.2,3,4This friable erythematous exophytic papule has clinical resemblance to pyogenic granuloma (PG) but has distinct histologic features.",0
"Therefore, it is crucial for dermatologists to be aware of this condition, as it is rare and likely often misdiagnosed.",0
"To our knowledge, this case is the first report of AAOC in pregnancy.",0
"In addition to clinical similarity, AAOC could be misdiagnosed as PG with ossification because of the vascular and bony growth on histology.",0
"Of 4 reports of PG with ossification, only one commented on the lobular vascularity.5,6,7,8Kim et\xa0al5describes PG with ossification as lobular proliferation of capillaries with spicules of spongy bone with osteocytelike and osteoblastlike cells.",0
The pathogenesis of AAOC remains unclear.,0
Burgdorf and Nasemann6proposed 2 theories of cutaneous ossification.,0
One notion is that primitive mesenchymal cells differentiate into normal osteoblasts in the wrong location.,0
The other theory is that undifferentiated mesenchymal cells undergo metaplastic differentiation in the setting of inflammation or hypoxia.,0
"In previous case reports, the investigators believed that the vascular proliferation in both\xa0AAOC and PG were induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).2,3,4Endothelial cells produce signals such as bone morphogenic protein (BMP) to induce metaplastic differentiation and ectopic bone formation.9Osteoblasts are also\xa0responsible for production of VEGF.10The combination of VEGF and hypoxia induce BMP expression.9Together, VEGF and BMP are the most likely factors that induce vascular proliferation and bone formation in AAOC.",0
"Because AAOC might be misdiagnosed as PG or other benign cutaneous neoplasm, it may not be rare\xa0but rather underreported.",0
"With the possible driving factors of VEGF and BMP, this lesion is benign and can recur after excision.",0
Dermatologists should be aware of the distinguishing features of\xa0scattered bone formation and diffuse capillary proliferation of AAOC rather than the lobular aggregates in PG.,0
Long-Term Effects of Prenatal Exposure to Undernutrition on Cannabinoid Receptor-Related Behaviors: Sex and Tissue-Specific Alterations in the mRNA Expression of Cannabinoid Receptors and Lipid Metabolic Regulators\n\nAbstract\nMaternal malnutrition causes long-lasting alterations in feeding behavior and energy homeostasis in offspring.,0
"It is still unknown whether both, the endocannabinoid (eCB) machinery and the lipid metabolism are implicated in long-term adaptive responses to fetal reprogramming caused by maternal undernutrition.",0
"We investigated the long-term effects of maternal exposure to a 20% standard diet restriction during preconceptional and gestational periods on the metabolically-relevant tissues hypothalamus, liver, and perirenal fat (PAT) of male and female offspring at adulthood.",0
"Our results suggest that the long-lasting adaptive responses to maternal caloric restriction affected cannabinoid-regulated mechanisms involved in feeding behavior, adipose β-oxidation, and hepatic lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis in a sex-dependent manner.",0
"Introduction\nAlthough, overnutrition is an important life style factor for the development of metabolic syndrome, obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus (Alberti et al.,2009), maternal undernutrition resulting in early life nutritional unbalance can be also related to the onset of long-term metabolic alterations observed later in life.",0
"Importantly, this hypothesis supports that fetal undernutrition can represent the origin of cardiovascular disease, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia at adulthood (Barker and Osmond,1988; Barker et al.,1989,1993).",0
"The epidemiological data from the Dutch Famine have showed that people whose mothers were exposed to undernutrition in early gestation developed more metabolic abnormalities than people exposed in other pregnancy stages (Roseboom et al.,2006).",0
"Currently, maternal undernutrition is a problem not exclusive of developing countries.",0
"The pressure to thinness in western societies associated to a higher prevalence of women with a past of eating disorders or a worry in excess about body changing during pregnancy and postpartum have raised the risk for giving birth underweight babies (Easter et al.,2013; Linna et al.,2014).",0
"However, we should not discard a predictive marker of impaired fetal nutrition in those cases with absence of low birth weight.",0
"Experiments with animals models have succeeded in simulate metabolic alterations of undernutrition during gestational periods in humans, particularly by the implementation of a moderate or severe calorie restricted diets (Desai et al.,2005; García et al.,2010; Palou et al.,2010; Suzuki et al.,2010; Lukaszewski et al.,2011).",0
"Consequently, the exposure to a moderate or severe restricted diet during pregnancy has been associated to features of metabolic syndrome in adult offspring such as higher adiposity (Yura et al.,2005; Suzuki et al.,2010; Lukaszewski et al.,2011), alterations in glucose metabolism (Jimenez-Chillaron et al.,2005; Breton et al.,2009; Theys et al.,2011), or alterations in the lipid plasmatic profile (Desai et al.,2005,2007a; Palou et al.,2010,2012).",0
"Moreover, these metabolic alterations after a maternal calorie restricted diet have been found associated to abnormalities in feeding behavior such as hyperphagia (Vickers et al.,2000; Breton et al.,2009; Manuel-Apolinar et al.,2014) or high preference for high-fat diet (Palou et al.,2010; Lukaszewski et al.,2011).",0
"Some studies have also noticed that the metabolic profile exhibited by offspring depends on the sex (Desai et al.,2007a; Palou et al.,2010; Suzuki et al.,2010).",0
"Several biologic mechanisms underlying the nutritional programming, which become altered after the exposure to a maternal restricted diet during pregnancy, have been identified.",0
"Interestingly, recent studies have documented epigenetic modifications or affectation of adrenocortical growth in offspring after maternal dietary restriction around the time of conception (Nicholas et al.,2013; Zhang et al.,2013), pointing out the importance of the periconceptional window in the metabolic programming.",0
"The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is also implicated in metabolic and behavioral mechanisms involved in fetal programming such as leptin signaling (Di Marzo et al.,2001) or dopaminergic system (Melis et al.,2004).",0
"Long-term effects of ECS activation could finally increase the risk from suffering metabolic diseases that lead to obesity and metabolic syndrome (Tibirica,2010; Cristino et al.,2014).",0
"Additionally, it has been revealed that some ECS components are sensible to dietary conditions.",0
"As the main endogenous agonists (anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol) of the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 are derivatives of fatty acids, it has been demonstrated that the lipid profile of the diet could modify the endocannabinoid levels (Artmann et al.,2008) in some tissues, including the early developing brain (Berger et al.,2001).",0
"Consequently, the cannabinoid receptor activity may be modified.",0
"Furthermore, the gene expression of the ECS components could be modified after the exposure to different dietary conditions (Bello et al.,2012).",0
"Taking together, these data suggest that the ECS could play a putative role in nutritional programming and hence in the early origin of metabolic diseases.",0
"Regarding the potential relation between ECS and fetal undernutrition, a few studies have demonstrated that the maternal exposure to a calorie-restricted diet during pregnancy and/or lactation could decrease the hypothalamic endocannabinoids and/or acylethanolamines in offspring (Matias et al.,2003; Ramírez-López et al.,2016).",0
"However, it is unknown whether changes in nutritional programming by maternal diet restriction during fetal development could modify the expression of ECS components later in life and lead to long-lasting impact on energy metabolism and feeding behavior.",0
"Based on these considerations, we aim to focus on the long-term effects on cannabinoid-related behaviors (i.e., cannabinoid receptor antagonist-induced suppression of feeding), and effects on lipid-related metabolic pathways of a maternal exposure to a moderate caloric restriction during the preconceptional and gestational period.",0
"Additionally, it was assessed the spontaneous and compulsive feeding behavior, growing parameters, leptin, plasma metabolites, and adiposity after weaning (adolescence and adulthood).",0
We hypothesize that the maternal exposure to a moderate calorie-restricted diet could alter the energy homeostasis regulated by the ECS and could re-program fatty-acid metabolism later in life in a sex-specific manner.,0
We also proposed that these putative alterations could increase the vulnerability to develop metabolic diseases in adulthood.,0
"In order to minimize the estrous cycle-related variability, the female rats were closely housed in adjacent cages and randomly distributed among the different experimental groups (McClintock,1978,1984).",0
"To avoid litter effects, samples from 6 to 15 liters per perinatal group were used in all determinations.",0
Statistical analysis indicated a significant decrease in body weight gain and caloric intake in the calorie-restricted dams after gestation.,0
"In contrast, calorie-restricted dams exhibited an increase in body weight gain after lactation, despite of the lack of effect on caloric intake during this period.",0
"From birth to PND 22 (lactation), three-way repeated measures ANOVA showed a main and significant effect of time on body weight [ F(22, 145)= 675.53, P< 0.001; Figure2B].",0

"Specifically, Bonferroni analysis indicated that CC and RC adolescent females displayed higher caloric intake than the respective CC and RC adolescent males (days 1, 2, and/or 4).",0
No differences in the caloric intake were found between CC and RC offspring at adolescence (Figure3C).,0
"At adulthood (Figure3D), we observed a main effect of time [ F(3, 71)= 367.04, P< 0.001], diet [ F(1, 73)= 6.49, P< 0.05], and sex [ F(1, 73)= 124.57, P< 0.01].",0
"Interactions between time and sex [ F(3, 71)= 34.005, P< 0.01], and diet and sex [ F(1, 73)= 4.58, P< 0.05] were found.",0
"Specifically, Bonferroni analysis indicated that RC adult females exhibited a reduction in caloric intake compared to CC adult females at days 1 and 2 of the test.",0

"Discussion\nThis study demonstrates that the maternal exposure to a moderate (20%) caloric restriction (undernutrition) during preconceptional (2 weeks) and gestational (up 2 days before birth) periods produced long-term effects on body weight, feeding behavior and gene expression of key components of the ECS (receptors and enzymes) in a sex-dependent manner.",0
"These effects extended to lipid and cholesterol metabolic pathways, suggesting the existence of a complex pattern alterations derived of adaptation to maternal malnutrition.",0
A moderate maternal caloric restriction produces sex-dimorphic effects in feeding and body weight gain only after weaning\nThe dams exposed to undernutrition during prenatal stages exhibited a reduction in their body weight gain and caloric intake during gestation that contrasts with the increase in their body weight during lactation with normal nutrition.,0
"This finding is in agreement with previous studies in humans, which demonstrated that offspring exposed to famine or hyperemesis gravidarum in the first part of pregnancy did not show lower birth weight (Roseboom et al.,2006; Grooten et al.,2015).",0
"Similarly, animal studies documented normoweight at birth when the early pregnancy was conducted under caloric restriction (Cleal et al.,2007; Palou et al.,2010; Poore et al.,2010).",0
"In contrast, a lower weight at birth has been described in several studies when the calorie-restricted diet was prolonged to birth (Desai et al.,2005; Lukaszewski et al.,2011).",0
"An explanation that emerges from these studies is that the putative fetal underweight caused by maternal undernutrition may be recovered in few days of normal nutrition, as was previously suggested (Cleal et al.,2007; Ramírez-López et al.,2016).",0
"Returning to our data, weight recovery in offspring may occur as a result of an accelerated catch-up growth before birth caused by an ad libitum maternal feeding.",0
The differential response to the maternal undernutrition in energy balance is sexual dimorphism dependent during the post-weaning periods.,0
The results indicated that CC male rats showed an increase in body weight and abdominal fat mass that contrasted with a decrease in caloric intake and compulsive feeding during the adolescence and adulthood compared to CC female rats.,0
"As we will discuss below, these sex-differences extend to metabolic pathways under the control of the endogenous cannabinoid system, as previously suggested (Wagner,2016).",0
"Thus, the effects of the maternal caloric restriction on the energy balance of male and female offspring should be interpreted based on their sex-dependent basal metabolism.",0
"The increase in body weight of RC male offspring is directly associated with an increase in abdominal fat and, particularly, a higher percentage of perirenal adiposity relative to body weight.",0
"The elevated fat mass and body weight justify the higher levels of triglycerides, LDL, VLDL, bilirubin, and the adipocytes-specific satiety hormone leptin in plasma.",0
"In contrast, the female offspring from calorie-restricted dams did not show changes in body weight and adiposity, but exhibited higher levels of LDL and glucose in plasma, and a reduction in chocolate preference at adolescence and total caloric intake at adulthood.",0
"The lower compulsive feeding in RC females can be associated with the hyperglycemia via a hypothalamic impairment of glucose-sensing to control hunger and satiety (Routh et al.,2014).",0
Previous researches have demonstrated metabolic alterations after undernutrition in a sex-dependent manner.,0
"Increased adiposity, lipid profile, glycemia, and leptinemia in male offspring have been reported after the exposure to a moderate undernutrition at different pregnancy periods (Desai et al.,2007a; Palou et al.,2010).",0
"Concerning the potential explanations of the differential phenotypic features between males and females, the leptin sensibility can play an important role.",0
"Indeed, the higher leptin levels in plasma without reduction in food intake suggest leptin resistance and, therefore, an altered leptin signaling (Friedman and Halaas,1998).",0
"A putative decrease in hypothalamic sensitivity to leptin may result in an inability to detect satiety despite the fat stores, which finally develop to obesity (Sasaki,2015).",0
"The higher leptin sensitivity described in females than in males has been associated with gonadal hormones (Clegg et al.,2003,2006) and may explain in part the higher levels of leptin found in the plasma of male offspring.",0
"Furthermore, the placenta responses to maternal diet in a sex-specific manner (Tarrade et al.,2015), suggesting that the sexual dimorphism in adiposity-relevant parameters could be present at very early stages.",0
"Effects of moderate maternal caloric restriction on feeding behavior\nThis differential sex effect on body weight after maternal caloric restriction was in agreement with data from previous studies (Palou et al.,2010).",0
"The obvious explanations to the higher body weight found in RC males after weaning could be as a consequence of an increased food intake, decreased energy expenditure or higher metabolic efficiency.",0
"Concerning hyperphagia, several studies have reported this feeding alteration after the exposure to undernutrition in critical windows of development (Vickers et al.,2000; Desai et al.,2005; Breton et al.,2009; Palou et al.,2010; Lukaszewski et al.,2011; Manuel-Apolinar et al.,2014), so it has been proposed as an important contributor of the excessive body weight.",0
"Intriguingly, our data indicated that either male or female offspring from calorie-restricted dams did not display higher caloric intake after weaning, despite of the fact that the males exhibited greater body weight at adulthood.",0
"Indeed, discrepancies were also found in the literature.",0
"For instance, it has been also documented excessive body weight in absence of higher food intake (Yura et al.,2005; Sebert et al.,2009; Theys et al.,2011).",0
"Evidence in some studies pointed out that hyperphagia could be a transitory effect that disappears when the underweighted animals after maternal undernutrition were able to reach the weight as controls (Vickers et al.,2000; Lukaszewski et al.,2011).",0
"So, hyperphagia could be a compensatory effect after prolonged underweight.",0
"In this context, it is plausible in our experimental model that RC offspring did not showed underweight and, therefore, hyperphagia in any stage.",0
"It is important to note that when caloric intake is adjusted to body weight the effect of maternal caloric restriction on appetite seems more discrete (Lagisz et al.,2014).",0
One possibility that emerges from our data is that male offspring can increase their body weight by either a reduction of energy expenditure or higher metabolism efficiency.,0
"This fact might be a consequence of the inadequate fetal programming of metabolic systems involved in energy homeostasis (Hales and Barker,2001; Vaag et al.,2012).",0
"The analysis of the cannabinoid-regulated metabolism, such as the expression of key enzymes, receptors and regulators of the lipid and cholesterol metabolism, could provide some clues to what may be happening.",0
"The effect observed in the RC offspring were contrary to those from previous studies, which described either, an increased preference for higher caloric diets after exposure to caloric restriction during pregnancy (Lussana et al.,2008; Palou et al.,2010) or hyperphagia in animals fed with a high-fat diet (Lukaszewski et al.,2011).",0
Different factors can partially explain the discrepancies found in food preferences.,0
(2010) described a higher preference for a fat-rich liquid diet than a carbohydrate-rich liquid diet in male offspring fed for 1 h after an adaptation period of 8 days (habituation to diet).,0
"However, our data indicated a lower preference for a novel highly-palatable food (chocolate mixture) than the familiar standard diet in RC females when they were exposed for 4 days.",0
"The lower acceptance to novel foods has been found in animals with protein deficiency from early gestational stages (Peregoy et al.,1972; Pettus et al.,1974) and could be associated with abnormal behaviors in adulthood related to anxiety (Peleg-Raibstein et al.,2012).",0
"Regarding the timing of restriction, protein deficiency during early pregnancy induces a less preference to a high-fat diet in the female offspring (Bellinger and Langley-Evans,2005), whereas a high preference was obtained when restriction was applied through other gestational periods (Bellinger et al.,2004; Bellinger and Langley-Evans,2005).",0
"According to our results, a maternal caloric restriction prior to mating could be critical for the less compulsive feeding observed in female offspring.",0
The tendency to lower chocolate preference suggests an increased threshold of the palatability.,0
"Interestingly, the ECS is implicated in the intake of palatable food (DiPatrizio and Simansky,2008) and the perception of sweet taste (Niki et al.,2015).",0
"Interestingly, caloric restriction induced a higher reduction in total intake in the female offspring treated with AM251.",0
"This subtle difference may indicate some alterations in the central rewarding functions of the ECS, as was previously described in animals with reduced preference for highly palatable foods (Brand et al.,2012).",0
Impact of maternal caloric restriction on the expression of the endogenous cannabinoid system in organs related to energy expenditure and metabolism\nThe sex-dependent effects of maternal caloric restriction on feeding behavior and metabolic profile in offspring can be a result of a differential re-programming in energy metabolism.,0
"Moreover, long-lasting changes in the gene expression of components of the ECS, which modulates appetite and energy homeostasis, and other key enzymes and regulators of lipid and cholesterol metabolism, were found in metabolically relevant tissues (liver and PAT) of adult offspring in a sex-dependent manner.",0
"These results likely indicate that the up-expression of the cannabinoid receptors in the hypothalamus at adulthood may result from a lower long-term cannabinoid activity that, in turn, could be produced by lower levels of eCBs and N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) in the hypothalamus of male offspring as was previous described at birth (Ramírez-López et al.,2016).",0
This interpretation also agrees with the down-regulation of the endocannabinoid metabolism in peripheral tissues.,0
"However, the adult female offspring from calorie-restricted dams showed a decreased gene expression of Cnr1 and the eCBs-degrading enzymes Faah and Mgll in liver as well as the NAEs-synthesizing enzyme Napepld in PAT.",0
The prominent down-regulation of the eCBs-degrading enzymes in the liver of RC females may result in a different endocannabinoid signaling than that of RC males.,0
"Higher endocannabinoid levels as a result of a lower expression of the eCBs-degrading enzymes FAAH and MAGL in liver can be associated with alterations in the lipid and cholesterol metabolism (Dinh et al.,2002; Osei-Hyiaman et al.,2005; Di Marzo and MacCarrone,2008), due to the fact that both eCBs anandamide (AEA) and 2-AG can inhibit the gene expression of apolipoprotein A1, the primary protein component of HDL, through the activation of CB1 receptors in hepatocytes (Haas et al.,2012).",0
"Despite of these alterations, in general, the female phenotype seems less severely affected after the exposure to maternal undernutrition in early development.",0
Any explanation for these dimorphisms should be supported by the elevated gene expression of Cnr2 in the liver and PAT of the RC female offspring compared to those of the RC males.,0
"Interestingly, the CB2 receptor activation was associated with anti-obesity effects (Verty et al.,2015) and a decreased risk for cardiovascular diseases.",0
"For instance, the gene deletion of the 2-AG-degrading enzyme Mgll has been linked to attenuation of diet-induced insulin resistance and improvement of atherosclerosis via CB2 activation (Taschler et al.,2011; Vujic et al.,2016).",0
"Taken in account the lower impact of the exposure to undernutrition observed in females in particular, and the lower risk of cardiovascular diseases described in females in general (Blenck et al.,2016), we can speculate that the CB2 receptor up-regulation may play a protective role in adverse metabolic conditions.",0
"The higher gene expression of Cnr1 in the hypothalamus, which was subtly more evident in male than female offspring from caloric-restricted dams, was not so clear in previous studies (Matias et al.,2003).",0
"(2003) demonstrated a decrease in the hypothalamic levels of AEA (confirmed by Ramírez-López et al.,2016) and an absence of significant changes in the gene expression of Cnr1 and Faah in the hypothalamus of weaned pups after a maternal undernutrition throughout the last part of pregnancy and/or lactation.",0
A possible explanation of this discrepancy could be related to the critical consequences of the maternal undernutrition at preconceptional periods.,0
"The up-expression of Cnr1 in the hypothalamus has been associated with the leptin resistance in obesity (Thanos et al.,2008; Cardinal et al.,2012).",0
This fact agrees with the increased body weight and the higher plasma levels of leptin in RC male offspring despite of the absence of hyperphagia or alterations in hypothalamic endocannabinoid machinery.,0
"It was described that long-term undernutrition from early stages lead to higher gene expression of Cnr1 in several brain regions of the leptin-deficient obese Zucker rats (Thanos et al.,2008).",0
"These findings indicate that leptin action and, therefore, the normal function of leptin receptors reduces the endocannabinoid tone and CB1 receptor activity (Di Marzo et al.,2001).",0
"Regarding the absence of hyperphagia, it is important to note that the food intake has been associated with the cannabinoid activation in specific hypothalamic areas (Soria-Gomez et al.,2014).",0
"However, previous studies suggested that specific CB1 receptor deletion in the hypothalamus was able to decrease body weight and increase energy expenditure, but was not accompanied with changes in food intake (Cardinal et al.,2012).",0
"Therefore, an alteration in the hypothalamic levels of endocannabinoids in newborn animals, as was previously described by Ramírez-López et al.",0
"(2016), could impair the sympathetic neurotransmission and hormones involved in energy metabolism (Di Marzo et al.,2001; Keimpema et al.,2013,2014; Cristino et al.,2014).",0
"Thus, the down-expression of the eCBs-degrading enzymes Faah and Mgll in the PAT of RC male offspring is consistent with an obese phenotype, hyperleptinemia, adiposity, and alterations in lipid metabolism in absence of increased food intake, as was previously described in animals with deficiency of FAAH and MAGL (Tourino et al.,2010; Geurts et al.,2015).",0
"In contrast, the decreased gene expression of the 2-AG-synthesizing enzymes Dagl α and Dagl β is opposed to what was previously found in the adipose tissue of obese subjects (Engeli et al.,2014).",0
"Therefore, the down-regulation of the endocannabinoid machinery in the adipose tissue of male offspring at adulthood may result in a putative compensatory effect in order to respond to an unbalanced endocannabinoid tone originated at birth after maternal undernutrition.",0
"The down-expression of all these elements in PAT indicates lower energy expenditure in RC males, which agrees with the increased perirenal adiposity and the higher levels of triglycerides in plasma.",0
"These features were also linked to an impairment of the browning process of the white adipose tissue (Geurts et al.,2015).",0
"Despite we found a decrease in the gene expression of Ppar γ, opposite results after the exposure to undernutrition (Bispham et al.,2005) and similar results after malnutrition during early development have been documented (Ahmad et al.,2013; Reynolds et al.,2014).",0
"Interestingly, the decreased gene expression of Ppar γ has been linked to inflammatory processes associated with obesity and insulin resistance (Odegaard et al.,2007; Reynolds et al.,2014), an issue that enhances the importance of the inflammatory responses in the developmental programming.",0
"As these nuclear receptors has been also linked to the activation of fatty-acid β-oxidation and insulin sensitivity (Auwerx,1999; Minnich et al.,2001), their decreased levels in RC females might be associated to alterations in lipid and glucose metabolism (Liu et al.,2015).",0
"The down-expression of these elements suggests a reduction of fatty-acid and cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver of RC females, which could partially explain the altered levels of the lipid carriers high-density, low-density and very low-density lipoproteins (HDL, LDL, and HLDL) in plasma.",0
"The HDL was 10-fold reduced in the plasma of RC females, which indicates a significant reduction of the outlet rate of fat molecules (cholesterol, phospholipids and triglycerides) from cells.",0
"In contrast, the LDL was two-fold increased in the plasma of RC females, which is strongly associated with artherosclerosis within the artery wall and poses a risk for cardiovascular disease.",0
"Similarly to human cohort studies, our results emphasize the importance of early life programming as the exposure to undernutrition during early development increases the risk from suffering features of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease later in life (Desai et al.,2005,2007b; Jimenez-Chillaron et al.,2005; Yura et al.,2005; Breton et al.,2009; Palou et al.,2010; Suzuki et al.,2010; Lukaszewski et al.,2011; Theys et al.,2011).",0
Sexual dimorphisms: an open question\nA major finding of this study is the appearance of sexual dimorphisms on the effects of maternal caloric restriction in the adult offspring.,0
Differences extend not only to metabolic parameters and gene expression but also to behavioral responses.,0
A major issue in sex differences is the need for control the estrous phase on which the evaluations were performed in order to clarify the impact of sex hormones variations in the female.,0
"Since the number of animals needed to control the three phases of the estrous cycle, including morning to afternoon time variations, was too high to be affordable, we had to use randomly cycling female animals sacrificed only during the morning time.",0
This limitation has to be considered in the interpretation of the data and further research will be addressed to evaluate the reasons for the sex-dimorphic alterations.,0
"However, it is important to note that in the female rat, sex steroids regulate both the expression and function of the endogenous cannabinoid system, so a potential explanation will also involve the impact of malnutrition on this important modulatory system, as it was described previously (Bonnin et al.,1993; Rodríguez de Fonseca et al.,1994).",0
"Conclusion\nAs conclusion, our results demonstrated that the exposure to a moderate maternal restricted diet from the preconceptional period predisposed for the development of features related to the metabolic syndrome, affected subtly the feeding behavior and altered the gene expression of relevant regulators of the lipid and cholesterol metabolism, including the endocannabinoid signaling system, in metabolically-relevant tissues (hypothalamus, liver and PAT) of adult offspring in a sex specific-manner.",0
"Moreover, the outcomes of the present study enhance the importance of the periconceptional period as well as the role of maternal diet in the early life programming, due to the fact that the maternal undernutrition was implemented before mating and offspring were raised in an ad libitum standard feeding.",0
"Importantly, this evidence supports the idea that the contribution of the endocannabinoid system in the early life programming could be critical.",0
Our findings represent an important key point to understand the complexity of the fetal programming process and might be particularly useful in the searching of efficient therapies against a malprogramming.,0
Further studies should be performed to clarify the role of the endocannabinoid system and other homeostatic mechanisms implicated in the process of nutritional programming.,0
"Investigation of the vitamin D nutritional status in women with gestational diabetes mellitus in Beijing\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nVitamin D deficiency is a common issue, which has relation with GDM, during the pregnant period.",0
To study the Vitamin D nutritional status of pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in the middle and late pregnancy and analyze the different sources of Vitamin D intake.,0
The level of 25-hydroxy Vitamin D (25-OH Vit D) and the sources of Vitamin D intake and the frequency of food consumption rich in Vitamin D were investigated.,0
"The diet records showed that the frequencies of consumption of dairy products and eggs among patients were 7.5\u2009±\u20093.8/week and 5.6\u2009±\u20092.2/week, respectively.",0
Conclusion\nMost of the patients took Vitamin D supplements which may help to maintain the nutritional balance of Vitamin D.\n\nBackground\nVitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the gut and maintains adequate serum calcium and phosphate concentrations to ensure normal mineralization of the bone.,0
Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults [1].,0
"Study has shown that exposing edible mushroom to ultraviolet B light could increase its Vitamin D2 content and raise serum 25-OH VitD2 in healthy adults [2,3].",0
Study also has shown that serum 25-OH VitD2 detection rate is less than 5% in China [4].,0
Serum 25-OH Vitamin D level is recognized as the best indicator of Vitamin D status.,0
"Adequate Vitamin D status (>30\xa0nmol/L) significantly promotes calcium absorption and reduces rickets risks, which was deemed as good Vitamin D nutritional status.",0
"Some researchers defined serum 25-OH Vitamin D lower than 50\xa0nmol/L as diagnostic criteria for Vitamin D deficiency, 50–75\xa0nmol/L as inadequate, and higher than 75\xa0nmol/L as adequate [4,6,7].",0
"Previously, ELISA was used to measure serum 25-OH Vitamin D level.",0
"Recently, LC-MS/MS became the gold standard of measuring Vitamin D level due to its ability to differentiate and accurately quantify the two subgroups of 25-OH Vitamin D (25-OH Vitamin D2 and 25-OH Vitamin D3); (2) high specificity, which allows differentiation of the target molecule from other metabolic intermediates, as well as avoiding interference as seen in immunological methods; (3) high sensitivity, which allows detection at ng/mL level.",0
Such method allows nutrition researchers to identify Vitamin D food sources and evaluate dietary pattern.,0
Vitamin D deficiency is closely associated with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM).,0
"Vitamin D is also a potential immunosuppressant, which down-regulates the expression of pro-inflammation markers, such as TNF-α and IL-2, among pregnant women with GDM [8].",0
There is an increased risk of Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy [9].,0
Study has found that the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is 66–96% [7].,0
"Currently, it is recommended to use multiVitamin or calcium supplements containing Vitamin D for women during pregnancy to increase their Vitamin D intake.",0
"The dosage is based on dietary intake recommendations [10,11].",0
It is important to pay attention to Vitamin D nutritional status in GDM pregnancy nutrition management.,0
"Using a new assessment technique, we investigated Vitamin D nutritional status among outpatients with GDM in our hospital, and analyzed Vitamin D sources and its association with dietary pattern.",0
"The serum level of 25-OH Vitamin D2 in the intervention group was 11.61\u2009±\u20096.71 (6.06–24.71) nmol/L, however, the serum 25-OH Vitamin D2 level in the fourteen cases in the control group was too low to be detected with the current technology (Table\xa02).",0
Discussion\nNormal Vitamin D level is one of the nutritional management goals for women with GDM.,0
"Most women (66–96%) in their middle and late pregnancy in Beijing are Vitamin D deficient if diagnosed with the criteria of serum 25-OH Vitamin D level <50\xa0nmol/L (ELISA method), as indicated in two studies from Department of Endocrinology and Department of Laboratory Medicine in Peking Union Medical College Hospital [6].",0
"This is comparable with the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency among the general population in Beijing area (LC-MS method, 11% if diagnosed with serum 25-OH Vitamin D level <25\xa0nmol/L, or 55% if diagnosed with serum 25-OH Vitamin D level between 25 and 50\xa0nmol/L method) [5].",0
"The Vitamin D deficiency level identified in this study was 20.4%, which is lower than those identified in the studies discussed previously.",0
Sunlight exposure time has an important impact on Vitamin D3 level.,0
The seasonal variations of serum 25-OH Vitamin D level detected in these subjects are consistent with natural environmental changes in the area of residence.,0
"Thus, the strength and duration of sunlight exposure become the main factors affecting the Vitamin D level in their bodies.",0
"Besides sunlight exposure, Vitamin D supplementation is also an important factor that affects serum 25-OH Vitamin D level among women with GDM.",0
This study finds that 85.7% of pregnant women received supplements containing Vitamin D. Their serum 25-OH Vitamin D levels were higher than those without supplement use.,0
"In addition, participants with GDM in this study were mostly urban residents with a higher socioeconomic status.",0
"It is noted that the detection rate of serum 25-OH Vitamin D2 in the study is 19.4%, higher than the usual 5% in the general population [3].",0
"However, only four out of nineteen participants with supplement use who was also positive for Vitamin D2 received Vitamin D2-containing supplements.",0
25-OH Vitamin D2 is also detected in the serum of these four participants.,0
"Therefore, consumption of Vitamin D2-containing supplements is associated with higher Vitamin D2 detection rate among pregnant women.",0
"However, other contributing factors could not be excluded.",0
"Previous studies identify edible fungi as the primary plant-based dietary source of Vitamin D. However, edible fungi were hardly seen in the dietary records among participants in this study.",0
Such low consumption rate and amount cannot be the leading cause of high Vitamin D detection rate in these participants.,0
"Accumulation of Vitamin D2 in food chain, such as from poultry fed with Vitamin D2 fortified feeds and their eggs, also contribute to elevated Vitamin D2 levels in human bodies.",0
"As a result, higher egg consumption among participants in this study may explain the higher detection rate of Vitamin D2.",0
"In addition, researchers find dairy products in China are mainly fortified with Vitamin D3, which will not translate into higher Vitamin D2 detection rate among participants.",0
"Conclusions\nIn summary, 20.4% pregnant women with GDM in their middle and late pregnancy are deficient in Vitamin D, though their Vitamin D levels were higher than the general population.",0
"It is necessary to increase exogenous Vitamin D intake in this population especially in fall and winter, when there is an increase of Vitamin D deficiency in Beijing area.",0
"This group often uses dietary supplements containing Vitamin D. They also have a Vitamin D2 detection rate of 19.4%, which can be explained by consuming edible fungi or supplements containing Vitamin D2.",0
"Alternatively, higher eggs and poultry consumption may also explain the high detection rate.",0
Further study is needed to confirm this.,0
Maternal intake of sugar during pregnancy and childhood respiratory and\xa0atopic outcomes\n\nAbstract\nThe possible role of maternal consumption of free sugar during pregnancy in the inception of respiratory and atopic diseases has not been studied.,0
"We aimed to study the relationship between maternal intake of free sugar during pregnancy and respiratory and atopic outcomes in the offspring in a population-based birth cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.",0
"We analysed associations between maternal intake of free sugar in pregnancy (estimated by a food frequency questionnaire), and current doctor-diagnosed asthma, wheezing, hay fever, eczema, atopy, serum total IgE and lung function in children aged 7–9\u2005years (n=8956 with information on maternal diet in pregnancy and at least one outcome of interest).",0
"After controlling for potential confounders, maternal intake of free sugar was positively associated with atopy (OR for highest versus lowest quintile of sugar intake 1.38, 95% CI 1.06–1.78; per quintile p-trend=0.006) and atopic asthma (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.23–3.29; per quintile p-trend=0.004).",0
"These associations were not confounded by intake of sugar in early childhood, which was unrelated to these outcomes.",0
"Our results suggest that a higher maternal intake of free sugar during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of atopy and atopic asthma in the offspring, independently of sugar intake in early childhood.",0
Abstract:SHORT\nHigher maternal intake of sugar in pregnancy may increase the risk of allergy and allergic asthma in the offspring http://ow.ly/zehc30bFswP\n\nIntroduction\nThere has been considerable interest in the role of maternal diet in pregnancy in the aetiology of childhood asthma and atopy [1].,0
"Studies have focused particularly on the potentially beneficial effects of antioxidants, following the hypothesis that a declining intake of antioxidants in Westernised countries has led to a reduction in pulmonary antioxidant defences, and hence to an increase in prevalence of asthma and atopy in recent decades [2].",0
"An alternative hypothesis, which has received less attention, is that the epidemic of asthma and atopy in the West could partly be explained by an increasing dietary intake of foods and constituents which may be harmful.",0
"Between 1970 and 2000, there was a 25% increase in the per capita consumption of all refined sugars in the USA, matching a worldwide trend [3].",0
"Current international dietary guidelines advise people to reduce their consumption of sugar, and more particularly free sugars, which comprise sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides) added to foods or drinks by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups and unsweetened fruit juices [4].",0
"While in children a high consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages [5–7] and fruit juice [7,8] has been linked to asthma, and particularly atopic asthma [7], the relation between total maternal consumption of free sugar during pregnancy and respiratory and atopic outcomes in the offspring has not been studied.",0
"One ecological study reported a correlation between perinatal consumption of sugar and severe childhood asthma symptoms [9], but could not specifically address maternal sugar intake in pregnancy.",0
"A recent Danish birth cohort study investigated the relation between soft drink consumption, but not total free sugar intake, during pregnancy and childhood asthma and allergic rhinitis [10].",0
We have investigated whether a high intake of free sugar in pregnancy is associated with adverse respiratory and atopic outcomes in the offspring in a large population-based UK birth cohort.,0
"The FFQ was used to estimate total energy intake and daily nutrient intake, by multiplying the daily frequency of consumption of a food by the nutrient content [14] of a standard portion [15] of that food, and summing this for all the foods consumed.",0
In this way free sugar intake was estimated.,0
Potential confounders\nWe selected potential confounding factors which are known (from existing literature) to be associated with one or more of the outcomes of interest [20].,0
In Model 1 we adjusted for total energy intake only.,0
In Model 2 we adjusted additionally for all potential confounders listed above.,0
"When evidence for associations persisted, we considered other factors which can be considered either as potential confounders or potential mediators of associations between maternal free sugar intake in pregnancy and childhood outcomes, i.e.",0
"[""We therefore adjusted additionally for maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) (self-reported), gestational age at delivery, birthweight, maternal weight gain during pregnancy (all abstracted from obstetric records) and child's BMI at age 7\u2005years (based on measured height and weight at clinic) (see supplementary figure E1 showing a directed acyclic graph).""]",0
"In order to assess confounding arising from other dimensions of diet, we additionally adjusted separately for maternal intake of vitamin E, zinc, selenium, n -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), n -6 PUFAs, and total fruits and vegetables in pregnancy [1,29–31].",0
"[""To investigate confounding by post-natal sugar intake, we adjusted additionally for child's sugar intake at age 3\u2005years.""]",0
"In order to investigate potential unmeasured confounding by genetic or shared environmental or lifestyle factors, we used a parental comparison approach, whereby effect estimates for maternal sugar intake in pregnancy were compared with effect estimates for maternal and paternal sugar intake after pregnancy.",0
"If there is a causal intrauterine effect, one would expect a stronger association with maternal intake in pregnancy than with maternal post-natal intake or paternal intake (the latter two exposures cannot have a direct biological effect on offspring asthma risk) (see further details in the supplementary material) [32,33].",0
"To correct for potential loss to follow-up bias, we used inverse probability weighting and assigned to each woman a weight that was the inverse of the probability of her selection for given values of covariates (see further details in the supplementary material) [35].",0
Characteristics of the 8956 mother–child pairs who were included in the analyses and those of the 3122 mother–child pairs with information on maternal diet who were excluded because of incomplete outcome data are compared in supplementary table E1.,0
Their offspring were more likely to have weighed less at birth and to have had a lower BMI at age 7\u2005years (table\xa01).,0
"After adjustment for potential confounders, there was weak evidence for positive associations between maternal free sugar intake in pregnancy and childhood doctor-diagnosed asthma and childhood wheeze (OR comparing highest versus lowest quintile 1.31, 95% CI 0.98–1.75; per quintile p - trend=0.09 and 1.42, 95% CI 1.05–1.92; per quintile p - trend=0.08, respectively), and stronger evidence for a positive association with atopy at age 7\u2005years (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.06–1.78; per quintile p - trend=0.006) (table 2).",0
"Post hoc analysis showed a positive association between maternal intake of free sugar and atopic asthma (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.23–3.29; per quintile p - trend=0.004) (table 3).",0
"[""Further investigation of potential confounding/mediation of main findings and sensitivity analyses\nAdditional separate adjustment for maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational age at delivery, birthweight, maternal weight gain during pregnancy and child's BMI at age 7\u2005years did not substantially alter the main findings and therefore no further formal mediation analysis was conducted (supplementary table E3).""]",0
"[""Additional separate adjustment for maternal intake of vitamin E, zinc, selenium, n-3 PUFAs, n-6 PUFAs, and total fruits and vegetables in pregnancy did not substantially alter the main findings (data not shown), nor did additional separate adjustment for child's free sugar intake at age 3\u2005years (supplementary table E3).""]",0
"The significant associations of maternal free sugar intake during pregnancy with childhood atopy and atopic asthma remained, unattenuated, on mutual adjustment for paternal (respectively, maternal) post-natal exposure (table 4and supplementary table E4, respectively).",0

"We studied associations between maternal free sugar intake in pregnancy and childhood asthma status phenotypes, and did not observe any association (supplementary table E5).",0
The exclusion of 17 women with implausible energy intake estimates did not alter the main results nor did exclusion of mothers with diabetes.,0
"Maternal “diabetes” was not associated with any respiratory or atopic outcome, but was associated with higher birthweight.",0
"Discussion\nIn this population-based birth cohort study, we found that a higher maternal intake of free sugar during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of atopy and atopic asthma in the offspring, independently of sugar intake in early childhood.",0
"To the best of our knowledge, these are novel findings.",0
"While a previous ecological study reported a positive correlation between perinatal consumption of sugar and severe childhood asthma symptoms [9], the limitations of ecological studies for inferring causality are well known (not least because of the high likelihood of confounding) [36].",0
"Furthermore, that study was unable to specifically investigate the potential role of maternal intake of sugar during pregnancy nor the specific role of free sugar.",0
Our longitudinal findings linking maternal free sugar intake in pregnancy to childhood atopy and atopic asthma extend the ecological results and allow stronger causal inference.,0
"Interestingly, the findings for atopy became stronger when we examined the association with multiple sensitisation.",0
"Although previous cross-sectional studies have reported a positive association between childhood consumption of sugar-containing drinks, including fruit juice, and asthma [5–8], intake of free sugar in early childhood in our study was not associated with any respiratory or atopic outcome.",0
Mechanisms\nWe speculate that high maternal fructose consumption may underlie the positive associations between maternal intake of free sugar and childhood atopy and atopic asthma.,0
"Fructose, which is a major component of added sugars, and is present naturally in fruit juice and in sweetened drinks as added sucrose (ratio of fructose/glucose 50/50%) or isolated fructose, has been mooted as driving previous cross-sectional findings linking sugar-containing beverage consumption to asthma in children [7,8].",0
"A prospective randomised controlled trial in adults showed that dietary sugar, and especially fructose, increased levels of C-reactive protein [37].",0
"Fructose also causes generation of uric acid [38], and experimental evidence in mice suggests that uric acid may be an essential initiator and amplifier of T-helper cell type 2 (Th2) immunity and allergic inflammation, through activation of inflammatory dendritic cells [39].",0
"Alternatively, fructose might influence atopic immune responses by conditioning the gut microbiome [40,41].",0
The potential of maternal diet in pregnancy to influence inception of offspring allergic airways disease through this mechanism was recently confirmed in a mouse model [42].,0
We therefore propose that one explanation for our main findings is that high fetal exposure to fructose may cause persistence of Th2 immune responses post-natally and allergic inflammation in the developing lung.,0
"In contrast to a previous study which reported a link between gestational diabetes and risk of atopic eczema and atopy in early childhood [43], we found no association between maternal diabetes during pregnancy and any outcome in the offspring, although, as expected [44], maternal diabetes was associated with higher birthweight.",0
The lack of a relation with maternal diabetes would suggest that higher fetal exposure to glucose is unlikely to explain our main findings.,0
"[""While high fructose consumption has been proposed as a risk factor for obesity [45], we found no evidence to suggest that the associations between maternal free sugar intake and atopy and atopic asthma in the offspring were mediated by maternal BMI, gestational weight gain or child's BMI, nor by prematurity or low birthweight, assuming key assumptions necessary for mediation analyses were met [46,47].""]",0
"Strengths and limitations\nStrengths of the ALSPAC birth cohort include its size and population-based prospective design, rich information on numerous potential lifestyle and dietary confounders (including information on childhood free sugar intake and parental sugar intake outside of pregnancy), and detailed phenotypic outcome measurements.",0
"Although the FFQ that we used had not been formally calibrated against other instruments such as diet diaries, it was based on the one used by Yarnell et\xa0al.",0
"[48], which has been validated against weighed dietary records and modified in the light of a more recent weighed dietary survey [13].",0
The FFQ lacked quantitative information on soft drink consumption and this will have led to underestimation of maternal free sugar intake during pregnancy.,0
"However, as misclassification of maternal free sugar intake in pregnancy is likely to have been random with respect to childhood outcomes, the strength of associations may have been underestimated.",0
"We were unable to assess associations with maternal sugar intake in early pregnancy; however, intakes in early and late pregnancy are likely to be highly correlated.",0
"We were unable to assess whether associations between maternal intake of free sugar in pregnancy and childhood atopy and atopic asthma persist beyond the age of 7\u2005years, as no data on atopy (only data on asthma status) have been collected in ALSPAC children after the age of 7\u2005years.",0
"We think that confounding of the main findings by lifestyle or other aspects of maternal diet in pregnancy is unlikely, as we controlled for numerous potential confounders in the analyses, including nutrients and foods that have been previously linked to childhood asthma and atopy.",0
"[""Importantly, the main findings were not confounded by the offspring's free sugar intake in early childhood.""]",0
"While the possibility of residual confounding cannot be ruled out, the null findings for maternal and paternal free sugar intakes after pregnancy make confounding by unmeasured familial behaviours linked to sugar intake and asthma risk a less likely explanation.",0
"As with any longitudinal study, we cannot rule out the possibility that exclusion of mother–child pairs without complete information might have biased our findings.",0
"However, it could be argued that, for our results to be totally spurious in those included in our analysis (and for the associations to be truly null in the population as a whole), associations in the excluded mother–child pairs would have to be in the opposite direction and much stronger, compared with the positive associations we reported in the included mother–child pairs, which seems extremely unlikely.",0
"Furthermore, loss to follow-up bias has been shown to only slightly modify associations in longitudinal studies, including in ALSPAC [49], and the results of our inverse probability weighting analysis [35] confirmed that loss to follow-up is unlikely to have biased our results.",0
"In view of the multiple analyses carried out and the post hoc nature of the findings for atopic asthma, we cannot exclude the possibility that the main findings occurred by chance; hence, they should be interpreted with caution.",0
"Given the a priori nature of the hypothesis being tested, and the fact that some outcomes of interest are highly correlated, it did not seem appropriate to correct for multiple testing.",0
"However, we plan to re-examine this hypothesis in another birth cohort to see if we can replicate the main findings.",0
Conclusions and public health implications\nWe conclude that a higher maternal intake of free sugar during pregnancy may increase the risk of atopy and atopic asthma in the offspring.,0
If these findings are replicated we would design an appropriate intervention study in pregnancy to establish or refute causality.,0
"Given the very high levels of sugar consumption currently in the West, where childhood allergy and asthma are so prevalent, confirmation of a causal link would raise exciting prospects for the primary prevention of these disorders.",0
"Vitamin D deficiency in Thailand☆\nVitamin D deficiency has received increased attention over the past several years since vitamin D may play an important role not only in bone metabolism but also in a variety of non-skeletal diseases such as diabetes mellitus, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases and cancer1,2,3.",0
"[""Latitude is an important determinant of vitamin D status since the amount of UVB that penetrates the earth's surface decreases markedly with increasing latitude[8].""]",0
People residing near the equator should have lower prevalence of vitamin D deficiency compared to people living at high latitudes.,0
"However, according to the recent studies, vitamin D deficiency is also common in these countries10,11.",0
[18]showed in a recent study in Thai children that vitamin D deficiency was also highly prevalent in school children aged 3–12.9 years.,0
Thai women are at risk for vitamin D insufficiency likely due to sunscreen usage and sun avoidant behavior due to the desire to maintain a fair complexion.,0
"Living in urban areas such as in Bangkok, increases the risk of vitamin D insufficiency due to increased pollution, which decreases the amount of UVB available for cutaneous vitamin D synthesis.",0
"Thus, dietary intake of vitamin D in Thai people is generally low.",0
"In summary, despite a location near the equator where sunlight is available year round, Thai people are at risk for vitamin D insufficiency due to environmental, cultural, lifestyle and dietary factors.",0
The relatively high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency may have important health implications for Thai people as the science of vitamin D continues to be unraveled.,0
A community-based cluster randomised controlled trial in rural Bangladesh to evaluate the impact of the use of iron-folic acid supplements early in pregnancy on the risk of neonatal mortality: the Shonjibon trial\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nIron-deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency globally.,0
"Due to the high iron requirements for pregnancy, it is highly prevalent and severe in pregnant women.",0
There is strong evidence that maternal iron deficiency anaemia increases the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes.,0
"However, most of the evidence is from observational epidemiological studies except for a very few randomised controlled trials.",0
IFA supplements have also been found to reduce the preterm delivery rate and neonatal mortality attributable to prematurity and birth asphyxia.,0
These results combined indicate that IFA supplements in populations of iron-deficient pregnant women could lead to a decrease in the number of neonatal deaths mediated by reduced rates of preterm delivery.,0
"In this paper, we describe the protocol of a community-based cluster randomised controlled trial that aims to evaluate the impact of maternal antenatal IFA supplements on perinatal outcomes.",0
"Methods/design\nThe effect of the early use of iron-folic acid supplements on neonatal mortality will be examined using a community based, cluster randomised controlled trial in five districts with 30,000 live births.",0
Discussion\nThis paper aims to describe the study protocol of a community based randomised controlled trial evaluating the impact of the use of iron-folic acid supplements early in pregnancy on the risk of neonatal mortality.,0
"This study is critical because it will determine if antenatal IFA supplements commenced in the first trimester of pregnancy, rather than later, will significantly reduce neonatal deaths in the first month of life, and if this approach is cost-effective.",0
Effective interventions directed specifically at preventing neonatal deaths are required to improve overall child survival.,0
"A systematic review in 2005 found that up to 70% of neonatal deaths, worldwide, could be averted by implementing sixteen evidence-based interventions at near universal coverage (99%) that incorporated preconception, antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal interventions [3].",0
"However, this review did not include antenatal iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation for pregnant women.",0
"At that time no trials had reported the effects of IFA on neonatal mortality, although these supplements were known to benefit both maternal and infant health [3].",0
"Due to the high iron requirements for pregnancy, it is highly prevalent and severe in pregnant women [4].",0
"The first national micronutrients status survey, published in early 2013, reported that iron deficiency among non-pregnant non-lactating women was 7.1%.",0
The survey findings also suggest a positive association between natural iron content in groundwater and iron status of women [6].,0
There is strong evidence that maternal iron deficiency anaemia increases the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes.,0
"However, most of the evidence is from observational epidemiological studies except for a very few randomised controlled trials.",0
IFA supplements have also been found to reduce the preterm delivery rate and neonatal mortality attributable to prematurity and birth asphyxia [7].,0
"Other studies from low-income countries have reported that preterm delivery is one of the main contributors to neonatal deaths [12,13].",0
These results combined indicate that IFA supplements in populations of iron-deficient pregnant women could lead to a decrease in the number of neonatal deaths mediated by reduced rates of preterm delivery.,0
We thus propose a large-scale prospective trial to measure the impact of the early introduction of antenatal iron/folic acid supplementation in pregnancy on neonatal outcomes in rural Bangladesh.,0
We didn’t consider placebo because WHO and Government of Bangladesh have a recommendation that pregnant women should receive 60\xa0mg of iron supplementation.,0
But the implementation of this recommendation is inadequate.,0
"Surveys indicate that only 52% of rural women reported any use of iron/folic acid in their last pregnancy but this dropped to 39% for the poorest households, and to 34% for women with no education (3).",0
"Objectives and hypothesis\nThe trial objectives are to evaluate the effect of early availability and promotion of IFA supplements on neonatal mortality, low birthweight and preterm delivery.",0
"The primary hypothesis is that in a community-based, cluster randomized controlled trial of women from rural Bangladesh, daily supplementation with 60\xa0mg elemental iron and 400\xa0μg folic acid starting in the first trimester of pregnancy, and sustained for at least 180\xa0days, will reduce neonatal mortality by 25% from 33/1000 to 24.8/1000 live births compared to usual iron-folic acid supplementation programs.",0
"The secondary hypotheses are that the early availability and promotion of IFA supplements in intervention clusters will reduce preterm delivery by 30% (15% in control to 10.5% in intervention), and low birth weight by 30% (15% in control to 10.5% in intervention).",0
"We further hypothesised that household wealth and maternal education would modify the neonatal mortality responses with a greater reduction for women from the poorest households, and women with no education.",0
"We also hypothesised that the early start to IFA supplements would not increase iron-related side effects, e.g.",0
nausea & vomiting in intervention clusters and will be cost-effective in reducing neonatal mortality in intervention clusters.,0
"We will also exclude three Upazilas from Gazipur because of the high number of garment industries, which would have high numbers of working women and would be difficult to follow-up and eight Upazilas from Mymensingh because of the high prevalence of malaria and kalazar.",0
"We will exclude areas where access is extremely difficult, for example in flood-prone areas.",0
The findings of the formative study suggested that introduction of IFA supplements early in pregnancy is feasible with support from BRAC or government community health workers.,0
"The formative study also suggested to include culturally sensitive reasons for the use of IFA supplements during pregnancy, improvement of the community health-worker training modules and to standardise messages across all health workers.",0
"Assuming a crude birth rate of 23 per 1000 people, 10% loss of pregnancies before birth and 15% loss to follow up each cluster will yield 300 births over 15\xa0months, and this will be sufficient to reach the desired sample size.",0
The models will evaluate the impact of the interventions over time by testing for an interaction between time and intervention group.,0
"We will conduct analyses to identify the subgroups (based on household wealth, sex of infant and maternal education) that modify the response to the intervention.",0
"Discussion\nIron deficiency is associated with increased risk of maternal death, preterm delivery, impaired foetal growth and development, low birth weight, increased neonatal mortality and impaired infant development [17].",0
"Although the importance of IFA supplements to prevent maternal anaemia and mortality is widely accepted, most antenatal IFA supplements distribution programs are of low priority.",0
"Evaluations of these programs using maternal anaemia as the outcome report little or no impact because of the multiple causes of maternal anaemia, low compliance, and inadequate distribution programs.",0
"Recent surveys in Bangladesh indicate that only 52% of rural women reported any use of IFA supplements in their last pregnancy, but this falls to 39% for the poorest households, and to 34% for women with no education [5].",0
"In the Projahnmo trial conducted in rural Bangladesh, only 40% of women in the baseline surveys reported any use of IFA supplements in pregnancy [18].",0
"Access to IFA supplements is through antenatal care, however, in rural Bangladesh, the median gestation that women commence antenatal care is 5.2\xa0months, and 44% of women report no use of antenatal care [5].",0
"Although they did not start early, these figures indicate there is a substantial opportunity to improve IFA supplements distribution in rural Bangladesh.",0
There is limited evidence about the optimal timing of IFA supplementation in pregnancy.,0
Promising evidence came from a trial in China investigating the effects of IFA supplements in pregnancy on neonatal deaths [19].,0
"However, the neonatal mortality analyses were post-hoc analyses, and the sample size was small resulting in poor precision in the effect estimates, and reduced power to explore all the factors modifying the effects on neonatal mortality.",0
"Thus, the impact of early IFA supplements on neonatal mortality needs confirmation in a larger scale trial.",0
"This project will determine if antenatal IFA supplements commenced in the first trimester of pregnancy, rather than later, will significantly reduce neonatal deaths in the first month of life, and if this approach is cost-effective.",0
"It will also provide valuable evidence about the role of groundwater iron level in modifying the responses of antenatal IFA supplements on neonatal mortality since there is already some evidence which suggests a positive, dose-response association between natural iron in groundwater and the iron status of women [6].",0
Maternal diet during pregnancy is related with the infant stool microbiome in a delivery mode-dependent manner\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nThe gut microbiome has an important role in infant health and immune development and may be affected by early-life exposures.,0
Maternal diet may influence the infant gut microbiome through vertical transfer of maternal microbes to infants during vaginal delivery and breastfeeding.,0
We aimed to examine the association of maternal diet during pregnancy with the infant gut microbiome 6\xa0weeks post-delivery in mother-infant dyads enrolled in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study.,0
"In the analyses stratified to infants born vaginally and adjusted for other potential confounders, maternal fruit intake was associated with infant gut microbial community structure (PERMANOVA, p \u2009<\u20090.05).",0
"In multinomial logistic regression analyses, increased fruit intake was associated with an increased odds of belonging to the high Streptococcus / Clostridium group among infants born vaginally (OR (95% CI)\u2009=\u20092.73 (1.36, 5.46)).",0
"Maternal dairy intake was associated with an increased odds of infants belonging to the high Clostridium cluster in infants born by Cesarean section (OR (95% CI)\u2009=\u20092.36 (1.05, 5.30)).",0
Linear models suggested additional associations between maternal diet and infant intestinal microbes in both delivery mode strata.,0
Conclusions\nOur data indicate that maternal diet influences the infant gut microbiome and that these effects differ by delivery mode.,0
"Background\nStudies have examined the maternal contribution to infant health, including the effect of maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation.",0
Prenatal diet influences the risk of infant and child allergy.,0
"For instance, the Mediterranean diet during pregnancy has been associated with a reduced risk of both persistent and atopic wheeze and atopy in children at 6.5\xa0years old [1,2].",0
"High meat consumption during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of wheeze in the first year of life, while maternal dairy intake is associated with a reduced risk of infantile wheeze [2].",0
Little is known about the actual mechanisms by which maternal diet affects children’s health; we hypothesize that maternal diet impacts the development of the gut microbiome in infancy and subsequently influences child health outcomes.,0
It is established that diet is an important driver of the gut microbiome.,0
Short-term diets comprised solely of either plant or animal foods have been shown to alter the human gut microbiome [3].,0
"To date, there has been limited investigation of the relation of maternal diet with the developing infant gut microbiome.",0
One study observed that maternal high-fat diet during pregnancy was associated with meconium microbial composition but had limited maternal diet data [6].,0
One mechanism the infant gut microbiome may be affected by maternal diet is via vertical transfer of maternal microbes to infants at delivery.,0
"There is a well-established relation of the infant gut microbiome with delivery mode (Cesarean section versus vaginally born infants) [7,8] which may persist through adulthood [9].",0
"Alternatively, maternal diet may affect fetal development and subsequent host response to microbial populations at and after birth.",0
"Additionally, differences in breast milk composition due to maternal diet may contribute to the infant gut microbiome in breastfed infants.",0
We examined the relationship of maternal diet during pregnancy with the infant stool microbiome in 6-week-old infants and identified associations within delivery mode groups.,0

"1b\n\nOperational taxonomic units in the infant gut and maternal dietary factors\nTo investigate the microbial taxa that may drive differences observed above, we measured associations between each maternal dietary factor and the relative abundance of individual infant stool operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with linear models adjusted for feeding method, maternal BMI, parity, and batch.",0
"While the microbiome-wide significance of maternal dietary factors after adjusting p values using the false discovery rate (FDR) method was not observed, OTUs with the same taxonomic assignment tended to appear together in the most significant results, supporting a true association of maternal dietary factors and infant gut microbiota.",0
"Maternal aMED score was positively associated with OTUs classified to the family Enterobacteriaceae , the genus Streptococcus , and the family Clostridiaceae , and negatively with OTUs classified to the species Bacteroides uniformis , the Enterobacteriaceae family, and the species Escherichia coli and [Ruminococcus] gnavus (Fig.",0
"Maternal dairy intake was positively associated with OTUs classified to the species Clostridium neonatale and C. butyricum and the genus Staphylococcus , and negatively related to OTUs classified to the Lachnospiraceae family (Additional\xa0file\xa01: Table S2b).",0
"OTUs classified to the genus Streptococcus including the species Streptococcus agalactiae were positively associated with maternal fish and seafood intake, while OTUs classified to the species Bacteroides uniformis were negatively associated (Additional\xa0file\xa01: Table S2c).",0
We observed a negative association between fruit intake and OTUs of the genus Bifidobacterium and a positive association with OTUs in the Clostridiaceae family in the infant gut (Additional\xa0file\xa01: Table S2d).,0
"We observed additional associations between these and other maternal dietary factors and infant stool OTUs, which are presented in the supplementary tables.",0
Associations in infants delivered by Cesarean section\nWe separately assessed the relation of maternal diet with the infant gut microbiome in infants delivered by Cesarean section ( n \u2009=\u200948).,0
"In an adjusted analysis, maternal dairy intake was associated with infant stool microbiome composition (generalized UniFrac distance PERMANOVA, p \u2009=\u20090.034; Fig.",0
"Linear models indicated a positive association of maternal dairy intake with OTUs classified to the family Enterobacteriaceae and the species Escherichia coli and negative association with the OTUs that belong to the genera Bifidobacterium , Pseudomonas , and Bacteroides (Additional\xa0file\xa01: Table S5b).",0
"One OTU classified to the genus Corynebacterium was negatively associated with maternal dairy intake ( p \u2009=\u20090.0044), and one each OTU classified to the species Acinetobacter rhizosphaerae ( p \u2009=\u20090.0040) and to the family Ruminococcaceae ( p \u2009=\u20090.0061), respectively, were also positively associated with maternal dairy intake, but we did not observe multiple related OTUs with similar associations.",0
"OTUs classified to the genus Enterococcus (one q value <\u20090.10) and the Lachnospiraceae family were positively related with and OTUs classified to the family Enterobacteriaceae , the species Escherichia coli and the genera Streptococcus and Blautia , were negatively related with the maternal aMED score (Additional\xa0file\xa01: Table S5a).",0
"As in vaginally delivered infants, maternal fish and seafood intake was positively associated with OTUs in the genus Streptococcus in infants delivered by Cesarean section (Additional\xa0file\xa01: Table S5c).",0
"In contrast to infants born vaginally, maternal dietary fish and seafood were positively associated with OTUs in the genus Bacteroides including the species B. uniformis and negatively associated with OTUs in the species Clostridium neonatale and other OTUs of the Streptococcus genus (Additional\xa0file\xa01: Table S5c).",0
"Additionally, maternal red and processed meat was positively associated with OTUs in the genus Bifidobacterium among others including the species Escherichia coli and the genus Enterococcus (Additional\xa0file\xa01: Table S5e).",0
2\n\nAssociations between maternal diet and infant gut microbial communities in infants delivered vaginally.,0
c Linear model associations between maternal aMED score and relative abundance of infant stool OTUs.,0
"in taxonomy labels indicate that the level of taxonomy is family, genus, or species\n\nDiscussion\nWe observed differences in both overall infant gut microbial community structure and specific microbes in relation to maternal dietary factors, often in a delivery mode-dependent pattern.",0
"Some effects of maternal diet were more apparent in exclusively breastfed infants; however, we were unable to compare to exclusively formula-fed infants since most infants received some breast milk.",0
"We found maternal fish and seafood consumption to be positively related to OTUs in the genus Streptococcus in the infant gut, which included the species Streptococcus agalactiae , or Group B Streptococcus .",0
Fish consumption is generally recommended as healthful due to its DHA and EPA content despite the exposure to heavy metals and other contaminants that may be detrimental to health [12].,0
"For instance, greater fish consumption is associated with child development outcomes including decreased risk of asthma and improved cognition [13,14].",0
The decrease in OTUs classified to the species Clostridium neonatale with increased maternal fish and seafood intake in infants born by Cesarean section is a possibly beneficial change to infant intestinal microbial communities.,0
We observed consistent associations between maternal DHA and EPA intake and infant gut microbiota.,0
"The associations of other maternal dietary factors with specific infant gut microbes were also somewhat unexpected, namely for red and processed meat and for fruit consumption.",0
"While fruit is considered healthful and red and processed meat consumption is recommended to be limited, OTUs in the genus Bifidobacterium , generally recognized as a beneficial microbe, were decreased with increasing maternal fruit consumption in vaginally born infants yet increased with higher maternal red and processed meat consumption in those born by Cesarean section.",0
The results from infant gut microbiome cluster analyses are consistent with this observation.,0
"For example, it is surprising that higher maternal fruit intake is associated with an increased probability of an infant delivered vaginally belonging to cluster 2, in which the genera Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides are underrepresented and the family Clostridiaceae is overrepresented compared to the other two clusters.",0
The effect of maternal dairy intake on infant gut microbiota was primarily observed in infants delivered by Cesarean section.,0
"One recent study suggests that both the microbial and fatty acid composition of breast milk may differ by delivery mode [18], so the differential effect of maternal dairy intake by delivery mode on the infant gut microbiome may be attributable to the differences in breast milk microbiota or lipids in relation to maternal diet by delivery mode.",0
"Our observation of increased colonization with the species Acinetobacter rhizosphaerae , a microbe that colonizes and promotes growth in plants [19], with maternal dairy in the Cesarean group is interesting in conjunction with the positive associations found between maternal dairy and the species Clostridium neonatale and Staphylococcus genus in vaginally delivered infants.",0
"Species of the genus Acinetobacter are increasingly involved in nosocomial infections [20], while the species Clostridium neonatale was initially isolated from infants affected by necrotizing enterocolitis [21], and the pathogenic potential of species in the genus Staphylococcus is well-established [22,23].",0
"Thus, it will be important to investigate whether maternal dairy consumption fosters the growth of potentially pathogenic microbes in the infant gut, particularly for infants delivered operatively.",0
"In several cases, a maternal dietary factor was associated with a microbe in both delivery groups but in opposite directions.",0
"Since Cesarean delivery results in differential microbial community structure of the infant gut [24], and the gut microbiome is a complex system, such differences are plausible; experimental studies will be required to confirm this observation.",0
"However, the associations between maternal diet and infant gut microbial communities did not always differ by delivery mode.",0
"For example, the maternal aMED score was consistently positively and negatively associated with the Enterobacteriaceae family, and additionally negatively associated with the species Escherichia coli , in both delivery mode strata.",0
"Our study sample was drawn from Northern New England, which has a relatively homogenous population; this could limit the generalizability of the study.",0
"However, by limiting unmeasured confounding due to differences in human microbiomes between populations that may result in erroneous associations with dietary differences, our study also may have greater internal validity.",0
"Maternal diet was assessed by self-report between 24 and 28\xa0weeks of gestation, and it is possible that dietary patterns change near the end of pregnancy or during lactation.",0
"However, diets are often stable, and a mid-pregnancy food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-assessment is likely to be sufficiently representative of late pregnancy and lactation diet in a high proportion of individuals [25,26].",0
"Nonetheless, the effects we observe may be due in part to maternal diet during lactation.",0
"Further, we cannot conclude if the effects of maternal diet occur only in breastfed babies, or also in those mostly fed formula, or a combination of formula and breast milk.",0
It is also possible that associations between maternal exposures and infant microbiota at 6\xa0weeks of life are influenced by factors not investigated in this study.,0
"Future studies examining the relationship between maternal diet and components of breast milk including microbial and nutritional profiles, as well as the potential influence of maternal diet on the fetal microbiome, may offer insight into the mechanisms by which maternal diet influences the infant gut microbiome.",0
Determining the impact of changes in the gut microbiome of infants due to maternal diet on infant health and development is an opportunity to refine dietary recommendations for pregnant and lactating women to support infant health.,0
"Conclusions\nIn conclusion, we identified three clusters of infant gut microbial communities and observed effects of multiple maternal prenatal dietary factors on the infant gut microbiome that often varied by delivery mode.",0
"In preliminary analyses of all infants, delivery mode, feeding method, as previously shown in our cohort [24], and parity were significantly related to infant stool microbial community composition at 6\xa0weeks of age.",0
Adjusted analyses included both variables known to be related to the infant gut microbiome by previous studies and variables significantly related to infant gut microbiota in our population to control confounding.,0
"To assess the relationship between each maternal dietary factor and infant gut microbiome cluster membership, we used multinomial logistic regression in the R package nnet adjusting all models for the same covariates as in previous analyses.",0
"To more precisely identify which microbial taxa contribute to the observed differences in infant stool microbial community composition by maternal dietary factors, we used a series of linear models to test the relationships between each maternal dietary factor and each OTU.",0
All analyses were analogously performed in the Cesarean section group to assess if an effect of maternal diet on the infant gut microbiome exists in the case of surgical delivery.,0
We were unable to adjust for antibiotic usage due to a paucity of exposure and imprecise data on timing of exposure.,0
"Genetic, management, and nutritional factors affecting intramuscular fat deposition in beef cattle — A review\n\nAbstract\nIntramuscular fat (IMF) content in skeletal muscle including the longissimus dorsi muscle (LM), also known as marbling fat, is one of the most important factors determining beef quality in several countries including Korea, Japan, Australia, and the United States.",0
"Genetics and breed, management, and nutrition affect IMF deposition.",0
"Here, we review results of research on genetic factors (breed and sex differences and heritability) that affect IMF deposition.",0
Cattle management factors are also important for IMF deposition.,0
"The effects of several management factors, including weaning age, castration, slaughter weight and age, and environmental conditions on IMF deposition are also reviewed.",0
"Nutritional factors, including fat metabolism, digestion and absorption of feed, glucose/starch availability, and vitamin A, D, and C levels are important for IMF deposition.",0
Manipulating IMF deposition through developmental programming via metabolic imprinting is a recently proposed nutritional method to change potential IMF deposition during the fetal and neonatal periods in rodents and domestic animals.,0
The coordination of several factors affects IMF deposition.,0
"Thus, a combination of several strategies may be needed to manipulate IMF deposition, depending on the consumer’s beef preference.",0
"INTRODUCTION\nIntramuscular fat (IMF) deposition or marbling in muscle including the longissimus thoracis et lumborum , infraspinatus , and biceps femoris , especially in Korean cattle (also called Hanwoo) and Japanese Black cattle, is one of the most important traits influencing beef quality and palatability attributes.",0
"Marbling is positively correlated with juiciness, tenderness, and palatability of beef [1].",0
The production of highly marbled beef in Korea is essential to compete with cheap imported beef that has a relatively low marbling score (MS).,0
"Several countries, including Korea, Japan, Australia and the USA, have considered IMF content as important to beef quality grade (QG), whereas European countries, including France and Germany, prefer leaner meat (less IMF content).",0
Understanding the factors affecting IMF deposition and the mechanisms responsible for its deposition is important when manipulating IMF deposition.,0
"Factors affecting IMF deposition can be sub-categorized into genetic (breed and sex differences, heritability), management (weaning age, castration, slaughter weight and age, and environment), and nutritional factors (fat metabolism, fat digestion and absorption, glucose/starch availability, roughage vs concentrate ratio, dietary energy and protein levels, vitamins A, D, and C levels, fetal and neonatal nutritional programming, and stage-specific feeding systems).",0
"Here, we also review these factors affecting IMF deposition in cattle.",0
It is important to identify the mechanisms responsible for initial muscle and fat cell growth during the developmental stage of cattle to better understand IMF deposition in later life.,0
"Du et al [16] proposed that myogenic, adipogenic, and fibrogenic cells are derived from common mesenchymal progenitor cells.",0
"Briefly, they proposed that mesenchymal stem cells are first committed to the myogenic and adipogenic–fibrogenic cell lineages during fetal muscle development [16].",0
Du et al [17] suggested that a shift in development of mesenchymal stem cells from myogenesis to adipogenesis may increase IMF deposition later in life.,0
It has been suggested that adipocyte formation in muscle begins approximately between late gestation and 250 d after birth in cattle [16].,0
Both hyperplasia and hypertrophy are involved in IMF deposition (Figure 1).,0
"Therefore, strategies that up-regulate both hyperplasia and hypertrophy of fat cells are effective ways to improve IMF deposition.",0
The nutritional and physiological condition of the fetus and the early postnatal stage affects the number of adipocytes in adipose tissues of animals [16].,0
"Thus, managing maternal nutrition is a potentially effective way to promote adipogenesis in fetal muscle [16].",0
Du et al [17] suggested that the order of effectiveness of nutritional management for manipulating IMF deposition is fetal stage>neonatal stage> weaning stage>older stages.,0
Harper and Pethick [23] recommended that producers focus on individuals with high genetic capacity to create more preadipocytes within animal muscle.,0
Albrecht et al [24] reported that hyperplasia of preadipocytes also plays an important role in marbling formation during postnatal growth of IMF because new marbling flecks appear after recruitment and filling with preadipocytes.,0
"Thus, during the late fattening stage of beef cattle, marbling adipocytes may grow continuously even though development of abdominal, intermuscular, and subcutaneous fat may slow or cease.",0
GENETIC FACTORS\n\nBreed and sex differences\nIntramuscular fat content in the LM varies significantly depending on the cattle breed.,0
Sex affects IMF content in the LM.,0
"Castrating bulls gener ally increases IMF content in several breeds, including Korean cattle and Holstein [9,38–40].",0
Heritability\nHeritability of the marbling trait has been reported in several cattle breeds.,0
Utrera and Van Vleck [41] presented estimates of heritability for cattle carcass traits in 72 studies (1962 through 2004).,0
The genetic potential of individual cattle can significantly affect IMF deposition.,0
"Greenwood et al [30] conducted a study to test effects of genotypes and nutrition during the immediate postweaning period on IMF contents in 5 muscles, marbling, and subcutaneous fat (rib fat or P8 rump fat) in Bos Taurus steers.",0
"Following weaning, steers were grown with a forage-only system and forage with high-energy supplemented system to test effects of a high-energy grain-based substitution on fat deposition with 5 times serial slaughter.",0
"In their study, genotype differences were generally observed in IMF contents of 4 muscles ( biceps femoris , supraspinatus , semitendinosus , longissimus lumborum , and infraspinatus ), although semitendinosus muscle IMF did not differ among genotypes.",0
"However, substitution of equivalent amount of energy from grazed pasture with high-energy grain-based feed has not increased IMF contents.",0
"Selecting a sire is important for high-quality beef production; animals with high genetic potential will generally exhibit higher MS at slaughter age, whereas animals with low genetic potential will give low MS [50].",0
"MANAGEMENT FACTORS\nSeveral management factors, including weaning age, castration, slaughter age and weight, nutrition and other environmental conditions can affect IMF deposition.",0
Weaning age\nWeaning age is known to affect IMF deposition and MS in beef.,0
Several studies have reported that early weaning or early weaning combined with a high-grain diet increases IMF deposition in beef cattle.,0
Effect of weaning age has been studied in Shorthorn calves [52].,0
"However, weaning treatment did not affect feed efficiency, post weaning growth, MS, and other carcass traits.",0
"In the Angus study, early weaning at 105 d of age and high concentrate feeding for 148 d followed by grazing and feedlot entry increased both the MS and hot carcass weight (HCW) compared with normal weaning at 253 d of age (normally weaned calves stayed with their dams to graze on pasture), although feedlot performance remained unchanged [54].",0
The authors suggested that metabolic imprinting by early weaning and a high concentrate feeding before grazing is a feasible method to improve MS and carcass weight.,0
A molecular study revealed that early weaning and a high-starch diet activated precocious pre-adipocyte differentiation and fat accumulation by activating adipogenic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARG) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α pathways.,0
"Smith and Johnson [57] suggested that the glucose contribution to fat synthesis decreases as cattle become fatter, whereas acetate use increases, especially in the IMF area.",0
"Those authors also suggested that providing dietary glucose sources (e.g., high-starch diet) at an early age can improve IMF deposition.",0
The authors suggested that feeding concentrate plus roughage or starch after early weaning at a young age could alter adipogenic and lipogenic potential in loin meat.,0
"Castration\nCastration of bulls generally increases IMF content in several cattle breeds, although it reduces growth rate [40].",0
"A 2016 report of nationwide pooled data in Korean cattle revealed that the majority (76%) of bulls had a QG 3, whereas 85.5% of castrated cattle showed grades of QG 1 or higher (QG1, QG1+, and QG1++) ([59];Figure 2).",0
"However, these changes with slaugther age were not observed in double-muscled Belgian Blue bulls [24].",0
The MS generally increases with slaughter age in Korean cattle.,0
This study suggested that changes in MS with slaughter age vary among farms.,0
"The difference may be due to genetic factors, management, or feed.",0
Decreasing slaughter age may be better for reducing production costs when feed prices are high.,0
"Pethick et al [69] suggested that a prolonged feeding period gives the cattle time to obtain high IMF levels because time is needed for muscle to reach maturity, followed by time for the muscle to fill up with IMF.",0
"However, feed efficiency decreases as animals age due to a decrease in the rate of muscle growth [70].",0
"Thus, animals with low genetic potential for QG are not recommended for a long fattening stage, which would result in low feed efficiency.",0
"In addition, a long fattening period could result in low yield grade (YG) because long-term fattening increases backfat thickness and carcass weight, which negatively affect YG in Korean cattle [59].",0
"Slaughter age needs to be optimised to get maximum profits for farmers by monitoring the QG and quantity grade of carcasses, feed costs, and carcass prices (auction prices).",0
Slaughter weight\nIMF content or MS generally increases with slaughter weight in several cattle breeds.,0
The National Beef Quality Audit of the USA (beef of steers and heifers in 28 packing plants during October–December 1991) found that MS increased with increasing slaugher weight from 173 to over 543 kg [71].,0
"Several factors, including MS or QG, feed costs, and carcass prices need to be considered to determine the optimum slaughter weight for the maximum profit.",0
"Environments\nStudies have demonstrated that environmental conditions, such as temperature stress, can negatively affect animal growth and beef quality in cattle [74].",0
Our recent study indicated that a lower ambient temperature decreased growth and feed efficiency in Korean cattle steers [78].,0
"Heat stress can also negatively affect animal performance, including growth, milk production, reproduction, feed intake, overall health, and well-being in cattle [79,80].",0
"The authors suggested that mild heat stress in summer and mild cold stress in winter may be beneficial to fat deposition under ad libitum feeding conditions for cattle fed in an unprotected, unsheltered area.",0
They also suggested that animals deposit fat in the winter to provide insulation for the body under cold stress.,0
Animals may require more energy to meet the increased maintenance energy requirements.,0
"Young [81] suggested that energy requirements increase during winter or when animals are under cold stress, as increased heat production is needed to maintain body temperature by shivering or other thermogenic process.",0
Angus crossbred cattle exposed to greater heat stress tend to have a greater MS [82].,0
The authors mentioned that slight heat stress might induce IMF deposition.,0
Seasonal variations in carcass characteristics have been observed in Korean cattle steers by our group [2].,0
"Therefore, the poor YG in winter may be due, in part, to high backfat thickness.",0
"However, both MS and QG were best in autumn and worst in spring.",0
Our recent study also revealed that growth performance was not affected by mild heat stress in Korean cattle [83].,0
"Overall, severe temperature stress may have significant negative effects on animal production, including growth performance and product quality, although mild temperature stress may differentially affect production.",0
"NUTRITIONAL FACTORS\nSeveral nutritional factors including fat metabolism, fat digestion and absorption, glucose/starch availability, roughage vs. concentrate ratio, dietary energy and protein levels, vitamins A, D, and C levels, fetal nutritional programming, and stage-specific feeding systems can affect IMF deposition.",0
"The activity of ATP citrate lyase is known to be low in ruminants [87]; thus, glucose is used as a lipogenic substrate less in ruminants than in monogastric animals [87].",0
"However, glucose is believed to be preferred to acetate as a substrate for FA synthesis for IMF deposition [88].",0
"Using an in vitro system of adipose tissue from Angus and Wagyu steers, Rhoades et al [91] reported that the rate of glucose incorporation into FA was over two times higher than the rate of acetate incorporation into IMF, although they were similar in subcutaneous fat.",0
"The same authors suggested that feeding a corn-based diet increased glucose uptake in IMF, whereas feeding a hay-based diet may promote subcutaneous fat deposition via incorporation of acetate into FAs.",0
Fat addition can affect IMF deposition.,0
"Therefore, increased glucose availability is important for providing glycerol for IMF deposition in ruminants [69], similar to monogastric animals such as pigs.",0
"Increasing propionate production for glucose synthesis is also important for IMF deposition, especially during the fattening period.",0
"For this reason, a large amount of concentrate is fed during the fattening period in Japanese Wagyu and Korean beef cattle [95,96].",0
High levels of IMF deposition requires excess energy con sumption above the maintenance and normal production requirements [69].,0
"These results suggest that higher energy levels are required for IMF deposition than for general body fat deposition, including for subcutaneous fat deposition.",0
"Cortisol is also an important regulator of energy metabolism, including the regulation of lipolysis and lipogenesis, and increases plasma NEFA concentrations [100].",0
"In addition, our recent research has shown that transport stress causes temporal increases in circulating cortisol and NEFA concentrations, along with a decrease in circulating TG concentration in pregnant Holstein heifers [103], consistent with transport stress also causing lipolysis.",0
"Thus, stressors, such as temperature and transportation, may have a negative effect on IMF deposition through lipolysis in beef cattle.",0
"Therefore, fat degradation by lipolysis should be minimized to prevent loss of IMF, and management and transport systems that minimize stress are needed.",0
Fat supplementation for extra energy supply has been recommended during cold or heat stress to prevent fat degradation.,0
"However, some studies have revealed that mild temperature stress can increase body fat deposition and marbling for insulation and other purposes [74,82], as described above.",0
Further study is warranted to clarify how stress intensity affects animal performance and fat deposition.,0
Manipulating dietary fat digestion and absorption in the small intestine may enhance MS. Emulsifying fat may affect the digestion and absorption of fat.,0
Bile acid supplementation may enhance fat digestion.,0
"Ursodeoxycholic acid supplementation increased IMF and QG in Wagyu heifers [26], demonstrating that bile acid supplementation improves IMF deposition, probably by increasing intestinal fat digestion and absorption by increasing fat emulsification.",0
Glucose/starch availability and roughage vs concentrate ratios\nConsuming surplus net energy is an important factor for deposition of IMF.,0
Feeding cereal grains is one way to raise net energy supply because energy dense grains can be utilized in the rumen and the small intestine to produce volatile fatty acids and glucose for energy production.,0
Maximum starch utilization can be achieved by optimizing fermentation of starch in the rumen to produce propionate (gluconeogenic precursor) and maximizing starch digestion and absorption in the small intestine.,0
"A considerable amount of glucose is absorbed from the small intestine when high-starch diets are fed, especially during the beef cattle fattening period.",0
Ørskov [110] reported that up to 42% of dietary starch may escape ruminal fermentation and reach the small intestine.,0
"A meta-analysis of starch digestion in dairy cows revealed that the ruminal digestibility of corn was 57.4% [112], demonstrating that a substantial portion of corn can be digested in the small intestine.",0
The same report estimated that up to 2 kg of starch/d can be digested in the small intestine of dairy cows; the average starch digestibility in the small intestine was 60.6%.,0
"Therefore, a better method to achieve high digestibility of starch in the small intestine is required to provide high post-absorptive glucose to the host animal.",0
"Pethick et al [69] reported that a high level of diet processing can increase the accessibility of dietary starch granules for both rumen and small intestine amylases, resulting in maximum glucose availability to the fattening animal [113].",0
"Grain type and processing affect IMF content [115]: maize is more effective at increasing IMF content than is barley, followed by sorghum.",0
Bindon [115] suggested that maize produces increased glucose from digestion in the small intestine and that steam flaking increases digestion in both the rumen and small intestine.,0
Pethick et al [69] suggested that feed that has a high glycemic index to allow rapid glucose absorption and concomitant high insulin levels through either grain feeding instead of grass finishing or grain processing provides increased net energy levels for FA synthesis.,0
Several studies have reported higher IMF content in high concentrate diets compared with low concentrate diets (reviewed in Wood et al [116]).,0
"In bulls of two Portuguese breeds (Alentejana and Barrosã), the effects of high (70% concentrate 30% maize silage) and low isoenergetic and isonitrogenous concentrates (30% concentrate 70% maize silage) on IMF contents were examined in the longissimus lumborum and the semitendinosus muscles [119].",0
"However, this difference was not observed in Alentejana bulls, indicating a breed difference in IMF content in response to the roughage-to-concentrate ratio.",0
"Similarly, dietary forage level affected MS. Jersey steers fed a low forage diet (6% Sudan grass, 6% alfalfa hay and 63.15% steam-flaked corn, dry matter [DM] basis) in a feedlot finishing diet had greater MS in the strip loin than did animals fed a high forage level diet (12% Sudan grass, 12% alfalfa hay and 51.20% steam-flaked corn) [121].",0
The effects of roughage/concentrate ratio on body fat deposition and the expression of angiogenic and adipogenic factors in adipose tissue have been examined in fattening Wagyu steers [122].,0
"However, fat weights in the subcutaneous, mesenteric, and intermuscular regions were not different between the groups.",0
"The expression of adipogenic factors (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha, and PPARG) in the subcutaneous fat and IMF was higher in the high-concentrate group than that in the low-concentrate group, indicating that the dietary roughage/concentrate ratio affects adipogenic gene expression in fat tissues.",0
The same authors suggested that total IMF within the LM in the high-concentrate group might be greater than that in the low-concentrate group by stimulating intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation.,0
"Concentrate diets are generally a major glucose source through either production of rumen propionate or glucose absorption from the small intestine from a rumen-bypassed concentrate, as described above, whereas roughage is a major acetate source that results from the rumen fermentation process.",0
"Higher IMF deposition with higher concentrate feeding may occur if IMF preferentially uses glucose as a substrate for FA synthesis, while subcutaneous fat uses acetate, as described by Smith and Crouse [88].",0
"Dietary energy and protein levels\nStudies in pigs indicate that a deficiency of essential amino acids such as lysine increases IMF content [123,124], and it has been suggested that an amino acid imbalance relative to energy levels may increase IMF content in cattle (reviewed in Pethick et al [69]).",0
Limited information is available on the effects of the dietary energy-to-protein ratio on IMF content in cattle.,0
"Effects of dietary energy (TDN: 70%, 80%; DM basis) and protein levels (crude protein [CP]: 11.9%, 14.3%; DM basis) on growth performance, carcass characteristics and meat quality were examined in F1 Angus×Chinese Xiangxi yellow cattle [125].",0
"Steers in the high-energy group had greater LM IMF content than those in the low-energy group, whereas dietary protein levels did not affect IMF content.",0
"However, dietary protein levels do not affect IMF deposition in Angus or Shorthorn steers (reviewed in Bindon [115]).",0
"Therefore, current studies are inconsistent in their results and conclusions on the effects of dietary protein levels affect IMF deposition.",0
"Vitamins\nSeveral vitamins, including vitamins A, D, and C, are implicated in regulating IMF deposition.",0
"A negative correlation was observed between serum retinol concentrations and carcass MS values in Japanese Black cattle [130,131].",0
"Several studies have shown that restricting vitamin A in the diet, or low beta-carotene (a precursor of vitamin A) intake, increases body fat, including IMF, deposition.",0
"The appropriate age for, and duration of, vitamin A deple tion or supplementation have been suggested as important factors that affect MS. Oka et al [134] reported that restricting vitamin A in 15-month-old cattle until the final finishing phase (29 months of age) increased MS, but not in 23-month-old cattle prior to finishing.",0
They suggested that serum vitamin A level affects the LM MS during the early fattening stage and that restricting vitamin A during the later stages of growth affects growth rate.,0
"Oka et al [134] recommended selective restriction of dietary vitamin A from 14 to 22 or 25 months of age to improve MS and QG without adverse health effects (blindness, arthritis, and muscular edema), given the effect of vitamin A restriction from 23 months of age in improving MS is minimal.",0
Continuous dietary vitamin A restriction during the late fattening phase is not recommended because prolonged vitamin A restriction may lead to health problems and retard growth rate [130].,0
"A continuous supply of normal levels of dietary vitamin A during the entire growth period may also result in poor marbling and QG, even if the growth rate were normal and no health problems occurred.",0
"Kawachi [137] described that the number of adipocytes increases in muscle between 13 and 19 months of age, so feeding a vitamin A-deficient diet during this stage may stimulate marbling.",0
"The appropriate concentration range for restriction of vita min A has been suggested as an important factor for enhancing MS and preventing health-related problems, including the incidence of blindness and muscular edema.",0
Oka [134] recommended that vitamin A-deficient levels not fall below 30 IU/dL to enhance MS and maintain health.,0
Ward et al [140] examined nutrigenetic interactions between the alcohol dehydrogenase 1C ( ADH1C ) single nucleotide polymorphism ( ADH1C c.-64T>C) and vitamin A levels and the impact on IMF deposition in Angus-cross steers.,0
A significant interaction was detected between ADH1C c.-64T>C genotype and vitamin A supplementation for IMF content in the LM.,0
"They concluded that the TT genotype of ADH1C c.-64T>C is related to greater IMF than the CC genotype when vitamin A is restricted, and ADH1C c.-64T>C could be a genetic marker for enhancing marbling in feedlot steers.",0
"One study reported that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3inhibited lipid accumulation by inhibiting key adipogenic factors such as PPARG [143].",0
Wang et al [144] suggested that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) competes with PPARG for binding to the retinoid X receptor (RXR).,0
"Higher VDR/RXR binding may decrease formation of the PPARG/RXR heterodimer, thus inhibiting adipogenesis (Figure 4).",0
Few in vivo studies have been performed on the effect of vitamin D on beef marbling.,0
"While vitamin A restriction improves marbling, but vitamin D restriction did not significantly affect marbling in Angus crossbred steers [133].",0
Further study is needed to clarify the effects of dietary vitamin D on MS and QG in beef cattle.,0
"Smith et al [145] suggested a possible connection between 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3and calcium homeostasis in the regulation of marbling.",0
"The increase in blood 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3levels in response to decreased calcium intake may downregulate preadipocyte differentiation, thus decreasing beef marbling.",0
"Thus, the dietary vitamin C requirement for beef cattle is not specified in the NRC [146].",0
"In addition, vitamin C may help to regulate adipogenesis.",0
Vitamin C increased preadipocyte growth of 3T3 L1 cells [148] and also had a positive effect on differentiation of sheep preadipocytes in primary culture [149].,0
A rumen-protected form of vitamin C is preferred as a dietary supplement because vitamin C is most likely degraded in the rumen [146].,0
Further study is necessary to clarify the effects of dietary vitamin C on MS and QG in other breeds of beef cattle.,0
"Fetal nutritional programming\nFetal programming or prenatal programing is the concept that mammalian embryonic and fetal development are linked to environmental changes, thus affecting the entire life [152].",0
The development of adipose tissue coincides with myogenesis during a particular time in fetal development [18].,0
"The gestation period is very important because it determines the fate of progenitor cells that will become muscle cells, fibroblasts, or adipocytes [16].",0
Nutritional manipulation of the fetus during gestation may affect animal performance and modify the quality and quantity of livestock products.,0
"Therefore, fetal nutritional programming via nutrition of dams during gestation may be one way to increase marbling in offspring later in life.",0
"Several studies have shown that fetal nutritional programming affects growth and/or beef quality, including marbling.",0
"For example, the effects of a 30% nutrient restriction in cows at early to mid-gestation on offspring (steers and heifers) growth and adiposity were tested in Angus×Gelbvieh [153].",0
"Adipocyte diameter in subcutaneous, mesenteric, and omental fat was larger in offspring of dams nutritionally restricted than in animals from dams with normal dietary intake (100% of NRC recommendations), but marbling data were not reported.",0
"In their study, YG was reduced, and HCW tended to be reduced in offspring of dams nutritionally restricted.",0
"In addition, nutritional restriction during early and mid gestation reduced ovarian characteristics (wet ovary weight, luteal tissue weight) of heifers, indicating negative effects of fetal programming on productive efficiency of replacement heifers.",0
This study indicates little or no effect of reduced maternal energy status during midgestation on offspring IMF deposition and muscle mass.,0
"Improving the nutritional condition of cows during pregnancy affects growth, fat deposition, and beef quality in steers; steers from cows grazing with better pasture (Thinopyrum–Elymus–Psathrystachus, CP 11.1% to 6.0%) during mid- to late gestation had greater live body weight at slaughter, HCW, and tenderness, and had an increased tendency for IMF deposition compared with offspring of cows grazing on native range (Bouteloua–Hesperostipa–Pascopyron, CP 6.5% to 5.4%) [155].",0
Effects of nutritional restriction from early gestation to parturition and/or throughout lactation on offspring growth and production characteristics to 30 mo of age and health and reproductive performance of cows were studied in large maternal grazing systems with offspring of Hereford cows mated to Piedmontese or Wagyu sires [33].,0
"However, the fetal programming did not significantly affect beef quality characteristics at 30 mo of age.",0
"In addition, authors emphasize importance of survival and health of cows and calves and of subsequent reproductive performance of cows for relative contribution of fetal programming to the profitability of beef production systems when developmental programming is applied [33].",0
"Radunz et al [156] tested the effects of three maternal late- gestational dietary energy sources (grass hay, corn, and dried corn distillers grains with solubles) on progeny postnatal growth and beef MS in an Angus cross-breed.",0
"The authors suggested that the prepartum maternal dietary energy source during late gestation can alter the development of fetal adipose tissue, affecting IMF deposition in progeny.",0
"However, studies during postnatal periods (after weaning or finishing period) show that feeding a high starch diet along with early weaning in steers generally increased marbling, as described above [51,53,157].",0
"Thus, the dietary energy source may differentially influence marbling and IMF deposition, depending on the feeding period.",0
"Overall, nutritional manipulation during the early, mid-, or late gestation period may affects adiposity or marbling of beef, but these effects are generally small and often masked by postnatal nutritional status, as mentioned by Bell and Greenwood [158].",0
"Further study is warranted to understand what mechanisms affect the adipogenic potential by nutritional modulation during the fetal period at specific gestation stages, thereafter affecting marbling and IMF deposition at the progeny slaughter stage.",0
Proper nutritional levels and proper selection of the types of energy sources for dams during each period of gestation stages may improve future production efficiency of progeny.,0
Some of the results presented above suggest restricted nutrition at certain stages of pregnancy has more favourable outcomes.,0
Bell and Greenwood [158] also suggest that effects of fetal programming during early-mid-gestation on postnatal growth or composition are generally minor.,0
"One of the mechanisms responsible for the effect of fetal nutritional programming on growth and adiposity of progeny is epigenetic modification (DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA) of gene expression during early development and permanent changes in offspring phenotypes in later life.",0
"Epigenetic modifications have been suggested to occur during development (fetal programming), growth, and fat deposition in cattle [13,18,159].",0
Our previous study showed the possible involvement of DNA methylation in regulating tissue-specific expression of PPARG gene in IMF and muscle of beef cattle [6].,0
"Thus, Korean and Japanese beef production systems have focused on production of highly marbled beef to satisfy their customers and to protect their beef industry against imported beef that has relatively low MS. As described above, several nutritional factors affect IMF deposition, and these factors must be considered to prepare a proper diet to improve marbling at the proper time in the life cycle.",0
"In addition, Japanese farmers generally restrict vitamin A levels in the diet during the mid-fattening stage to produce highly marbled Japanese Black cattle beef.",0
"Similarly, a growth stage-specific feeding system has generally been applied to Korean cattle to produce highly marbled beef.",0
The feeding strategy for highly marbled Korean cattle beef has been also described by Jo et al [96].,0
"CONCLUSION\nIn this article, we reviewed several factors (genetic, management, and nutritional factors) affecting IMF deposition in cattle (Table 2).",0
"IMF deposition can positively affect beef taste including tenderness and flavor, favoring highly marbled beef.",0
"This program has several limitations: the high proportion of concentrate in the diet and long fattening period (>30 months, especially in Korean cattle and Japanese Black cattle) may increase feed costs.",0
Excess energy supplied to mature animals during the late fattening period may significantly decrease feed efficiency.,0
"This may decrease digestibility of feed, increase animal feed waste, and eventually raise issues of animal industry sustainability.",0
"Current methods to increase IMF deposition are generally limited to increasing overall body fat deposition, including inedible fat.",0
"Further studies are needed to develop methods for producing highly marbled beef without increasing overall body fat deposition, including internal (abdominal, perirenal, mesenteric) and external (subcutaneous) inedible fat.",0
"In addition, high IMF deposition may negatively affect YG (or retail beef yield).",0
"Some sires may have high breeding value for both IMF and YG, and selection of such sires is likely to be beneficial for increasing IMF deposition without decreasing YG.",0
"Applying a single factor (e.g., nutritional or genetic) may not be adequate to increase IMF deposition.",0
"Development of new fusion technologies (e.g., nutrigenomics) with genetic, epigenetic, and nutritional factors may be more efficient to optimize IMF deposition and improve feed efficiency.",0
Nutritional programming during the fetal and neonatal periods has been suggested as a promising method to manipulate IMF deposition.,0
Further studies are warranted to test the feasibility of early nutritional programming for regulating IMF deposition in cattle.,0
"There has been increasing concerns by consumers about the negative impact of extremely highly marbled beef on human health, such as cardiovascular diseases and arteriosclerosis.",0
"Additional studies are warranted to produce beef with appropriate levels of IMF deposition to satisfy beef quality and taste, support human health, and sustain the animal industry, depending on the situation of each country.",0
"Effects of an antenatal dietary intervention in overweight and obese women on 6 month infant outcomes: follow-up from the LIMIT randomised trial\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nThe immediate impact of providing an antenatal dietary intervention during pregnancy has been extensively studied, but little is known of the effects beyond the neonatal period.",0
Our objective was to evaluate the effect of an antenatal dietary intervention in overweight or obese women on infant outcomes 6 months after birth.,0
"It is well recognised that a woman’s nutrition during pregnancy impacts pregnancy and birth outcomes, with the intra-uterine environment playing a key role in an individual’s later health and disease [3].",0
"Maternal obesity significantly predicts child and adult obesity in her offspring [4,5], and associated cardio-metabolic risk factors, including hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [6–8].",0
"Kitsantas and colleagues [9] report that maternal pre-gravid obesity increases the odds of pre-school obesity by a factor of 1.6 (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.26–2.03), while Rooney and colleagues [10] report a substantially greater increase in risk (RR 6.35; 95% CI 3.28–12.30).",0
"Exposure to such an intra-uterine environment potentially creates a vicious cycle in which the propensity to obesity is perpetuated, with major adverse public health implications [11,12], and implications for the health of successive generations [13].",0
There has been considerable research interest in the provision of antenatal dietary interventions during pregnancy to limit weight gain and improve pregnancy and birth outcomes for women and their infants.,0
"A comprehensive systematic review by Thangaratinam and colleagues [14] has identified numerous studies assessing dietary and lifestyle interventions in pregnancy, albeit mostly small in scope.",0
"While the findings reveal a relatively modest impact on weight gain [14], very little attention has been directed towards the ongoing follow-up of women and infants beyond the neonatal period to assess longer term outcomes.",0
"To our knowledge, only three randomised trials involving the provision of an antenatal dietary intervention [15–17] have conducted and reported findings of follow-up to 6 months after birth [18–20].",0
"However, these studies have been limited by the relatively low rates of assessment [18–20].",0
"Furthermore, studies have focussed predominantly on measures of adiposity, and have not reported other clinically relevant infant outcomes [18,20], or specifically reported infant outcomes among women who are overweight or obese [19].",0
"We have previously shown that a comprehensive dietary and lifestyle intervention during pregnancy, in women who are overweight or obese, significantly improves both maternal diet and physical activity [21], is associated with an 18 and 41% relative reduction in the risk of high infant birth weight above 4 and 4.5\u2009kg [22,23], and was a cost neutral intervention [24].",0
On-going participant follow-up is required to assess the further impact of these findings on childhood outcomes.,0
"This manuscript reports the effect of the LIMIT antenatal dietary intervention, on 6-month infant outcomes.",0
"Outcomes were additionally adjusted for maternal age, socioeconomic status and maternal smoking\nThere was no evidence to suggest that the effect of the antenatal intervention was modified by maternal BMI category for any of the reported outcomes (data not shown).",0
"The results, in terms of both direction and magnitude of effect, were consistent across all of these analyses.",0
"Discussion\nOur findings indicate that provision of an antenatal dietary intervention for overweight or obese women was not associated with effects on infant growth, measures of adiposity, and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 6 months of age.",0
There was no evidence to suggest that the effects of the intervention were modified by maternal BMI category.,0
A number of techniques have been described in the assessment of early infant body composition.,0
"Measurement of infant skinfold thickness [36,37] and bio-impedance are considered reliable and relatively non-invasive methods of assessing fat distribution, both of which have been correlated with more invasive measures [36,38–40].",0
"Furthermore, percentage fat, as determined by skinfold thickness measurements has been validated against DXA calculations of fat mass in both infants and children [36,41].",0
"Although these more detailed body composition assessment tools may have yielded more accurate estimates of the relative proportions of adipose and lean tissue mass, they were not considered feasible for use in the large scale setting required for this follow-up study, and its associated practical and financial constraints.",0
"While the use of a more sensitive test would provide more detailed and accurate estimates of early neurodevelopmental achievement, the ASQ has been validated against robust assessment tools [32], and in a paediatric population [33].",0
"Again, the resources and intensive psychology training required to administer, for example, the more complex Bayley Scale, while generating more detailed information, was not considered feasible in our study population.",0
"A potential limitation of our follow-up study is the risk of selection bias, with only 82% of the available cohort contributing data at 6-month follow-up assessments.",0
"We consider this risk, and the impact on the validity of our findings to be low.",0
"Our findings indicate no evidence of an effect of a comprehensive dietary and lifestyle intervention provided during pregnancy for women who are overweight or obese, on measures of infant growth, adiposity, and neurodevelopment at 6-months of age.",0
"This is despite our previously published findings of significant but modest improvements in maternal diet and physical activity during pregnancy [21], and an 18 and 41% relative reduction in risk of infant birth weight above 4 [22] and 4.5\u2009kg, respectively [23].",0
"While this may reflect evidence of a true lack of persisting effect of maternal dietary modification and birth weight on weight at 6-months of age, it may also be indicative that other factors are of relatively greater importance in driving early, ex-utero, infant growth and development.",0
Previous evidence on the longer-term effects of antenatal dietary and lifestyle interventions is limited.,0
"Although an assessment was conducted at 6 months post-partum involving 66% of participants [18], there have been no early infant outcomes reported to date.",0
"However, recently published findings from approximately 46% of eligible infants at 6 months of age (698 of 1522 eligible infants assessed) suggest a very small reduction in subscapular skinfold thickness measurement of ~0.4\u2009mm following provision of the antenatal intervention [20].",0
"While statistically significant, the clinical significance of such a small difference is questionable, the findings also consistent with a chance occurrence, particularly as this was a secondary outcome, and no other statistically significant differences were identified between the treatment groups in infant BMI, abdominal circumference, or the remainder of infant anthropometric measures obtained.",0
"There is emerging evidence, both from animal and human studies, of an association between maternal obesity and significantly higher risks of impaired offspring cognitive, motor and behavioural aspects of neurodevelopment [44–46].",0
"Children born to women who are overweight or obese are more likely to be identified with moderate to severe cognitive, motor and global developmental delay at 3 years of age [46], as well as poorer academic achievement extending to 14 years of age [44,45].",0
"Autism spectrum disorders in childhood have also been observed and diagnosed more frequently among children born to women with metabolic conditions identified during pregnancy, including diabetes and obesity [47].",0
"Our findings report, for the first time, the impact of an antenatal dietary intervention for women who are overweight or obese on early infant neurodevelopment.",0
"While we did not identify statistically or clinically significant differences in neurodevelopment at 6-months of age using a reliable screening tool, ongoing follow-up of participants further into childhood will again be important to determine whether there are any potential benefits of improving maternal diet and physical activity during pregnancy on childhood neurodevelopment.",0
"Despite this, it remains important to continue to follow-up the children whose mothers participated in this intervention trial, particularly in view of the well recognised association between high-infant birth weight and subsequent childhood obesity [48], and the emerging associations between maternal obesity and impaired childhood neurodevelopmental function [46].",0
"It will be valuable to utilise our clinical and biological databases to explore potential pathways whereby maternal obesity contributes to childhood outcomes, including obesity and impaired neurodevelopment.",0
"Nutrition during pregnancy and early development (NuPED) in urban South Africa: a study protocol for a prospective cohort\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nAdequate nutrition during pregnancy is important to ensure optimal birth outcomes, maternal health and offspring development.",0
"However, little is known about the dietary intake and nutritional status of pregnant women residing in urban South Africa.",0
"Therefore, the Nutrition during Pregnancy and Early Development (NuPED) cohort study was initiated to assess early nutrition-related exposures predictive of early childhood development in urban South Africa.",0
"Methods\nThe aims of this prospective cohort study are: 1) to assess dietary intake and nutritional status of urban pregnant women in Johannesburg, South Africa, and 2) to determine associations with birth outcomes, measures of maternal health, as well as measures of offspring health and development.",0
Discussion\nEnsuring adequate nutrition during pregnancy is one of the key actions endorsed by the South African Government to promote optimal early childhood development in an effort to eradicate poverty.,0
The results from this study may serve as a basis for the development of context-specific nutritional interventions which can improve birth outcomes and long-term quality of life of the mother and her offspring.,0
Background\nRecent estimates indicate that 250 million children in low- and middle income countries are at risk of not reaching their developmental potential [1].,0
"This is worrisome as suboptimal childhood development is associated with poorer adult health, well-being and productivity – leading to an intergenerational cycle of poverty.",0
"As the trajectories of physical and mental health later in life are determined fundamentally during the first 1000\xa0days of life, both the World Health Assembly Nutrition Targets and the Sustainable Developmental Goals call for action to, among others, improve maternal, infant and young child nutrition in an effort to ensure sustainable social and economic progress.",0
Maternal health and nutrition gained heightened attention three decades ago with the publication of the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis.,0
"Barker and Osmond [2] proposed that the cardiovascular disease they observed in an adult population from England and Wales was at least partly associated with poor early nutrition, and specifically undernutrition in utero [3].",0
"Undernourishment in utero can stress the foetus in ways that permanently affect physiological growth and development, and can be described as a reprogramming of the foetus’s developing phenotype [4].",0
"Several maternal nutritional factors have been investigated in relation to adverse pregnancy outcomes, as well as offspring health and development [7–9].",0
"The nutrients most studied during pregnancy include B-vitamins (particularly folic acid), vitamin D, iron, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (particularly n-3 fatty acids) and iodine [8,10].",0
"However, adequate maternal intakes of zinc and vitamin A may also be important for optimal pregnancy outcomes, as well as for maternal and offspring health [11–13].",0
"Furthermore, better overall diet quality has been associated with a lower risk for maternal perinatal depression and gestational weight gain, which in turn are risk factors for suboptimal offspring development [14–16].",0
The health of the adult South African population is a concern.,0
"The country is undergoing a rapid nutrition transition characterised by changes in dietary patterns and nutrient intake alongside urbanisation [19,20], which has resulted in a growing double-burden of under- and over-nutrition [20,21].",0
"The effects are also seen in children, with 27% of under-fives being stunted [22].",0
"Maternal short stature is, in turn, a risk factor for birth complications [24] – illustrating the intergenerational effect of poor nutrition.",0
Ensuring adequate nutrition during pregnancy is one of the key actions endorsed by the South African Government to promote optimal early childhood development in an effort to eradicate poverty [25].,0
"The Guidelines for maternity care in South Africa [26] therefore recommend routine nutritional assessment – such as measuring mid-upper arm circumference and haemoglobin levels – and daily supplementation of 200\xa0mg ferrous sulphate, 1000\xa0mg calcium and 5\xa0mg folic acid.",0
"However, studies show that the majority of South African women only seek or get access to public antenatal care in their second trimester of pregnancy [27–30], which might be too late for the routine supplementation programme or other interventions to be effective.",0
"Very little is known about the diet and nutritional status of pregnant women in South Africa, specifically residing in urban areas.",0
"Furthermore, understanding the associations of maternal diet and nutritional status during pregnancy with birth outcomes, as well as offspring health and development in the South African population will form the basis for the development of context-specific nutrition interventions that may improve birth outcomes and long-term quality of life of the mother and her offspring.",0
"Consequently, the Nutrition during Pregnancy and Early Development (NuPED) cohort study was initiated to investigate nutritional status during pregnancy and assess early nutrition-related exposures predictive of early childhood development in urban South Africa.",0
"Aims of the study\nThe aims of the NuPED study are 1) to assess dietary intake and nutritional status of urban pregnant women in Johannesburg, South Africa, and 2) to determine associations with birth outcomes, measures of maternal health, as well as measures of offspring health and development.",0
"Due to the high prevalence of HIV in the country (36% of women aged 30–34\xa0years [31]), their inclusion will make generalisation to the wider South African population a possibility.",0
It is important to note that in Johannesburg only 45% of women access ANC before 20\xa0weeks gestation and only 23% in their first trimester (as reported from other urban areas) [30].,0
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as a potential marker of neuronal growth and differentiation will be determined using ELISA [77].,0
"However, should the researchers be able to obtain additional funding, additional participants may be included.",0
"Discussion\nThe importance of perinatal nutrition and its role in offspring health, is recognised [79].",0
Nutrition during pregnancy is an important factor associated with both maternal and infant health outcomes [80].,0
"To date, however, South African public health nutrition interventions for pregnant women are limited to folic-iron and calcium supplementation, while it is highly likely that the diet of pregnant women living in South Africa is lacking vital micronutrients and essential fatty acids beyond those supplied, or is even containing excessive amounts of specific micro- and macro-nutrients.",0
"In order to advocate evidence-based healthcare policy and practice, the identification of nutrient deficiencies and poor eating patterns of pregnant women in South Africa, which are associated with adverse neonatal outcomes and delayed early offspring development, is imperative.",0
Little is known about the dietary behaviour and nutritional status of pregnant women living in South Africa.,0
"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first South African study focusing on the assessment of both maternal dietary intake and nutritional status in women pre- and postnatally and to investigate associations with outcomes of maternal and infant health.",0
This study is novel due to the comprehensive set of nutrition related data and indicators of maternal and infant health being obtained in a South African setting.,0
"Therefore, this explorative project will contribute to identifying factors that may be targeted in future pre- and/or post-conception maternal interventions for optimal offspring development and possibly reduction in adult NCD risk.",0
This study also has its challenges.,0
"South African statistics show that only 52% of women attend antenatal care before 20\xa0weeks’ gestation [30], thus access to women early in pregnancy is restricted and limits enrolment into the study.",0
"Furthermore, many healthcare facilities in Johannesburg serve a predominantly migrant population [81] posing a challenge for longitudinal data collection.",0
"Additionally, these women may choose to eat traditional foods [82] that do not form part of the South African Food Database for nutritional analysis; and may not be able to speak a local language [83] hampering detailed reporting during dietary assessments.",0
"Thus, migrating women or those unable to speak local languages could not be included in the study.",0
A limitation of the study is that women who fit the inclusion criteria are invited to join the study by visiting the data collection site at an agreed date.,0
Having this option of attending may contribute to self-selection bias.,0
Our recruitment data to date indicate that of those invited to take part in the study; only approximately 50% arrive at the data collection site on the booked date.,0
"Even so, this study will provide a comprehensive and unique database from an urban South African setting which will allow for cross-sectional, prospective and retrospective analyses to describe the nutritional status and dietary intake of pregnant women, and to determine associations with health outcome measures.",0
These results will supply context to intervention studies with the aim to improve maternal as well as offspring health in South Africa.,0
"[""Developmental Perspectives on Nutrition and Obesity From Gestation to Adolescence\n\nAbstract:KEY-POINTS\nObesity results from a complex combination of factors that act at many stages throughout a person's life.""]",0
"Therefore, examining childhood nutrition and obesity from a developmental perspective is warranted.",0
"A developmental perspective recognizes the cumulative effects of factors that contribute to eating behavior and obesity, including biological and socioenvironmental factors that are relevant at different stages of development.",0
"A developmental perspective considers family, school, and community context.",0
"During gestation, risk factors for obesity include maternal diet, overweight, and smoking.",0
"In early childhood, feeding practices, taste acquisition, and eating in the absence of hunger must be considered.",0
"As children become more independent during middle childhood and adolescence, school nutrition, food marketing, and social networks become focal points for obesity prevention or intervention.",0
Combining a multilevel approach with a developmental perspective can inform more effective and sustainable strategies for obesity prevention.,0
"[""Introduction\nObesity results from a combination of factors that occur at different stages during a person's lifetime.""]",0
"Therefore, childhood nutrition and obesity should be examined from a developmental perspective.",0
"First, prenatal and early life experiences influence the trajectory of weight into adulthood (1).",0
"Second, during certain critical periods, vulnerabilities are intensified to specific maternal and environmental exposures that can lead to obesity (2).",0
"Finally, the cumulative effects of multiple factors contribute to eating behavior and obesity (3).",0
"Growing evidence suggests that prenatal and maternal interactions and influences must be considered along with biological and environmental variables throughout infancy, childhood, and adolescence that may lead to — or prevent — obesity.",0
"Examining nutrition and obesity from a developmental perspective combines social context and biological influences with individual behavior (4,5).",0
We describe where these contexts interact with biological processes to affect food behavior and obesity.,0
"Although a person is at risk for obesity throughout his life, we focus on specific developmental susceptibilities for obesity from gestation through adolescence (Table).",0
Gestational Period\nRisk for obesity and metabolic disorders begins during gestation (1).,0
"Obesity is linked to in utero exposure to glucocorticoids, protein restrictions, and maternal diet and obesity.",0
Male offspring of female rats with a history of fetal exposure to glucocorticoids also exhibit low birth weight and glucose intolerance — a multigenerational effect (6).,0
"Feeding low-protein diets to pregnant rats produces a broad spectrum of disorders in their offspring (7): hypertension and vascular defects (8,9), altered fetal pancreatic development and structure (10), altered glucose tolerance (11), altered liver structure and function (12), altered gene expression (13), and possibly type 2 diabetes mellitus (10).",0
"In humans, low protein intake by women in late pregnancy has been associated with low birth weight, a marker of risk for obesity and other metabolic disorders later in life (14).",0
"Female rat pups born to and suckled by fat-fed mothers have high blood pressure, even after being placed on a balanced diet after weaning.",0
Such changes in early life are likely to lead to metabolic syndrome in adult animals (15).,0
"[""Many studies have indicated a link between smoking during pregnancy and the offspring's subsequent obesity, but the underlying mechanism has not been established.""]",0
"Children born to women who smoke during pregnancy typically weigh less at birth, and they often have a catch-up period during their first year, although studies have not consistently found a link between catch-up growth and greater childhood body mass index (BMI).",0
"Other hypotheses postulate mechanisms such as poor placental blood supply because of nicotine-induced vasoconstriction, poor maternal nutrition, and fetal exposure to carbon monoxide.",0
"[""Whatever the mechanism, the relationship between smoking during pregnancy and children's overweight is well documented (16,17)\nIn 1 study, for example, babies born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy weighed less than did babies born to nonsmokers (18).""]",0
"However, as they reached adolescence (age 11 years for girls, 16 for boys), children exposed to tobacco in utero had a significantly greater risk of being in the highest 10% of BMI for their age group.",0
"This tendency continued to strengthen with age (participants were followed through age 33) and could not be explained by other factors in their childhood, adolescence, or adulthood (18).",0
A recent 27-year study of children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy found larger annual changes in cholesterol levels; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased more than in children not exposed to tobacco in utero.,0
This was the first study to suggest that smoking during pregnancy is linked to adverse changes in the lipoprotein levels of children (19).,0
"In an analysis of questionnaire data from 8,765 children aged 5 to 7 years, smoking after pregnancy was not associated with childhood obesity but intrauterine exposure was (20).",0
Another study found that smoking during the 12 months before birth of a child was associated with adolescent overweight (21).,0
Studies have found a significant association between maternal prepregnancy overweight or obesity and overweight in children.,0
"This association indicates that overweight mothers are more likely to have overweight children, and these odds increase with the age of the child.",0
"For children aged 24 to 47 months, only maternal prepregnancy obesity had a significant effect; for children aged 48 to 71 months, either maternal prepregnancy overweight or obesity increased risk; and in children aged 72 to 95 months, maternal overweight or obesity imparted an even higher risk (21,22).",0
"[""Breast-feeding reduced the likelihood of early adolescent overweight in children whose mothers' prepregnancy BMI was 25 or higher, although the effect of breast-feeding was not significant in children of healthy-weight mothers (21,22).""]",0
"Thus, both prenatal and maternal variables can increase the risk of obesity in even the youngest children, long before social factors have an influence.",0
"Obesity prevention efforts at this stage of development have typically focused on encouraging healthy prenatal nutrition and breast-feeding; however, interventions to reduce maternal obesity during pregnancy have been limited.",0
Infancy and Early Childhood\n\nTaste acquisition and preference\nThe biological substrate that underlies the taste and rewarding properties of foods is relevant because the best predictor of food preference is whether a child likes the taste (23).,0
"Whether a food tastes good or bad and the pleasure of eating is a complex process mediated by chemical senses in the periphery and multiple brain substrates, which are remarkably well conserved phylogenetically (24).",0
"The small number of taste qualities may have evolved because of the functional importance of the primary stimuli (eg, sugars, sodium chloride, bitter toxins) in nutrient selection, especially in children.",0
"The heightened preference for sweet taste, which is evident within hours after birth and persists until adolescence (27,28) most likely evolved because sweet-tasting foods are high in energy.",0
"[""Children's heightened preference for salty tastes (29) attracts them to necessary minerals, and rejecting bitter-tasting substances protects them from poisons because most poisonous compounds taste bitter (30).""]",0
"However, although bitter tastes are innately disliked, with repeated exposure, infants can come to like certain foods that are bitter, particularly some vegetables (31-34).",0
"The 2002 Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study, designed to update knowledge on the feeding patterns of the youngest Americans, found that even before their second birthday, many American toddlers develop the unhealthy eating habits of adults (35).",0
"Although toddlers were more likely to eat fruits than vegetables, 1 in 4 did not eat any vegetables on a given day.",0
"Instead, like older children, they were more likely to eat fatty foods such as french fries, salty snacks, and sweet beverages and less likely to eat bitter-tasting vegetables (36,37).",0
"Our knowledge is growing of how, beginning very early in life, early sensory experience can shape and modify flavor and food preferences.",0
"[""For example, fetuses exposed to flavors, usually detected by the sense of smell, in amniotic fluid and infants exposed to flavors in breast milk (both of which reflect flavors of the mother's diet) (38) learn to like those flavors as they make the transition to eating adult foods (39).""]",0
"[""The foods that women eat when they are pregnant and nursing are precisely the ones that their infants should prefer because the mothers' eating them teaches the child that these foods are available, safe, and nutritious.""]",0
"At this time, however, how the protective factor of breast-feeding interacts with transmitting flavor preference for energy-dense foods in overweight mothers is unclear.",0
These sensory and biological considerations shed light on why lifestyle changes are difficult for young children to make.,0
The first emotional attachment to flavors should be exploited to try to reduce the prevalence of obesity in future generations.,0
"For this reason, preventive interventions may be most effective during pregnancy and postpartum, when women are highly motivated to change for the benefit of their children.",0
Pregnant and lactating women should widen their food choices to include as many flavorful and healthy foods as possible.,0
"These experiences, combined with repeated exposure to nutritious foods and flavor variety (31-34), should make children more likely to choose a healthy diet.",0
"Eating in the absence of hunger\nInfants (40,41) and young children (42,43) can adjust their food intake in response to changes in the caloric content of their diet, and biological sensations involving appetite probably underlie this ability.",0
"This ability has been documented at meals (42,43) and during the course of a day (44).",0
"The complex interaction of nature and nurture in the regulation of appetite (45) is exemplified by a behavior known as eating in the absence of hunger (EAH), a behavioral marker of impaired satiety (46-49).",0
"Children ranging in age from 3 (50) to 19 years (51) have been observed in laboratory settings to eat large amounts of palatable food in the absence of hunger, after a meal.",0
The amount of energy consumed in the absence of hunger is variable and related to child weight.,0
"EAH is seen more often in children who are overweight (39,47,49,52) and in children with higher 1-year weight gains (53).",0
This behavior is analogous to external (53) or disinhibited (54) eating behavior in adults.,0
"Genes influence many aspects of eating behavior, including taste sensitivity (55), food preference (56), intake of specific foods (57), meal patterns (58), energy density (59), macronutrient intake (60,61), and meal (61-63) and daily energy intake (61).",0
"Behaviors such as EAH may also be heritable (64), although evidence is limited.",0
"Genetic influences on EAH (49,65) and other eating behaviors such as emotional eating (66) are supported by findings that the behavior is more common when 1 or both parents are overweight, even after certain environmental factors (eg, parental eating habits) have been controlled for.",0
"Evidence for genetic influence on intake regulation is also reflected in the relative stability of behaviors like EAH within people during 2- to 6-year periods in childhood (47,67).",0
The biological underpinnings of EAH and other appetite-related behaviors are not well understood.,0
"EAH in children is associated with higher fasting insulin and leptin levels (64), 2 hormones that regulate appetite and body weight (68).",0
"Satiety responsiveness, a separate dimension of child intake regulation, has recently been linked to variations in the FTO gene (69), which confers obesity risk and is highly expressed in the hypothalamus, a center of appetite regulation in the brain.",0
"Similar to other aspects of appetite regulation (70,71), EAH appears to become more problematic throughout childhood (45,72).",0
"Though the causes are not known, socioenvironmental influences contribute to developmental shifts in intake regulation by overriding biologically based cues of hunger and satiety.",0
"Factors that modify intake regulation include the types and amounts of food to which children are exposed, social modeling of eating behaviors, and child feeding styles and practices (73).",0
"For instance, experimental research has demonstrated social modeling influences on both the types (74) and amounts of food eaten by young children (75-77).",0
"[""Studies of EAH among girls have shown positive associations with mothers' but not fathers' disinhibited eating (52,65).""]",0
"EAH has also been associated with restrictive feeding practices, although not consistently.",0
"[""Restricting children's access to a preferred food has been associated with higher levels of EAH in girls aged 3 to 5 years (49,78) and in non-Hispanic white girls aged 5 to 9 years (47,72,79).""]",0
"[""Laboratory studies of preschool-aged children have also demonstrated that restrictions placed on children's access to palatable, energy-dense foods can lead to increased food intake when restrictions are lifted and food becomes available (80,81).""]",0
"Other studies, however, found no link between feeding restriction and EAH (54).",0
"In many ways, inconsistencies in the literature on EAH parallel those observed in the general literature on child feeding, which may reflect the early stage of the work in the field.",0
"[""Knowledge of child feeding has largely evolved from laboratory studies that address cause and effect but provide limited insight on the usual environments and social interactions surrounding children's behavior.""]",0
"[""The approach parents take to feeding their children reflects their goals for their children's eating and health, and these goals are influenced by culture and socioeconomic status (82).""]",0
"[""To some extent, the effect of child feeding practices on children's health requires careful consideration of context.""]",0
Middle Childhood\nAnother critical period for the development of obesity is during middle childhood.,0
"BMI tends to decrease during early childhood and then, typically between the ages of 6 and 8, begins to rise again (adiposity rebound).",0
Excessive rebound and early rebound (before age 5) are related to higher BMI in adulthood (83).,0
"[""An early rebound may reflect the child's taking more control of intake, exposure to gestational diabetes, or early maturation (84).""]",0
"[""Children's patterns of weight gain vary by sex and age (85), and during stages of rapid growth, caloric requirements increase.""]",0
These stages are opportunities for interventions to prevent obesity by controlling caloric intake and increasing energy expenditure.,0
"In addition, because the prevalence of obesity increases among children after puberty, as the age of sexual maturity decreases in the population (86) obesity will probably become more prevalent among elementary school students.",0
Children of school age are highly susceptible to environmental stimuli such as marketing and food availability.,0
Studies suggest that children who are exposed to food advertisements eat more.,0
"[""Several studies of advertising on children's television programs found that the foods promoted increased the risk of becoming obese.""]",0
"[""In 1 study, at least half of food advertisements during children's television programming were for energy-dense, low-nutrient foods such as cereal, candy, snacks, soda, and fast food (87).""]",0
"Not only do such advertisements promote eating, but eating while watching television also often leads to overeating because children do not notice how much they are eating (88).",0
"A recent study showed that for each hour of television watched, children consumed an extra 167 kcal/d (89).",0
"This susceptibility is mainly because decision making, critical thinking, and abstract thinking are underdeveloped in childhood.",0
"Exposure to advertisements would decrease by restricting food advertisements that target children, especially during times, such as Saturday mornings, when many children are watching television (87).",0
"[""The school environment is an opportunity for study and intervention in children's health behaviors because multiple factors can influence obesity in this context.""]",0
"For example, the Coordinated School Health Program model from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention proposes a multilevel approach in which 8 different school components (eg, health education, nutrition services, healthy school environment, family and community involvement) interact to influence student health (91).",0
"[""Few studies of school eating patterns have focused on kindergarten and early elementary years, but in third grade, school lunch choices begin to influence children's overall diets (92).""]",0
"[""Schools' food policies affect student BMI; in 1 study, as the number of school food policies increased, students' mean BMI decreased (93).""]",0
The US educational system has typically fallen short in considering health a priority for academic emphasis or outcomes.,0
"Health outcomes must be included in the educational agenda and become part of school accountability to obtain support and funding for health-based policies and interventions, such as physical education, comprehensive health education, or BMI monitoring.",0
"A survey of the 100 largest school districts in 2006 found that, among the local wellness policies implemented, 99% dealt with nutrition standards of school meals, 97% required nutrition education for at least some grades, and 65% set standards for when teachers can use food to reward children for good behavior or academic accomplishments (94).",0
"School programs intended to alleviate the obesity crisis need funding, partnerships, and evaluation.",0
"[""In 2007, the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario set forth school policies that would prevent childhood obesity; these policies included promoting physical education classes for all students, requiring physical education specialists to be involved in physical education classes, selling healthy foods in cafeterias and vending machines, and promoting walking or biking to and from school (95).""]",0
"Adolescence\nIn addition to developmental risks carried from earlier life, by adolescence the cumulative effects of social disadvantage on obesity become apparent.",0
Analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Child-Mother File found that having an unmarried mother increased the risk for adolescent overweight.,0
"Education and current income were not significantly associated with adolescent overweight, and lifetime income was only marginally significant (21).",0
The Growing Up Today Study found that subjective social status in the school environment predicted BMI in adolescent girls (96).,0
Girls who ranked themselves at the low end of school social status were 69% more likely to have a BMI 2 kg/m2higher than that of girls of higher subjective social status.,0
The authors concluded that higher subjective social standing in school might protect against weight gain in adolescent girls.,0
The feedback loop in which low self-esteem increases the risk of overweight and overweight contributes to low self-esteem could be a critical point of intervention.,0
"[""An analysis of data from 12,067 people in the Framingham Heart Study revealed an association between people's weight gain and weight gain in their social networks (97).""]",0
"Rather than occurring randomly throughout social networks, people with BMI ≥30 kg/m2were clustered in the 32-year data set.",0
This finding was not explained solely by social ties between people who were already obese.,0
"The chance of becoming obese during a given period increased with development of obesity in a friend (57% increase), a sibling (40% increase), or a spouse (37% increase).",0
The effect was stronger between same-sex friends and siblings.,0
"This association did not extend to neighbors, nor was it associated with changes in smoking behavior.",0
A more recent study examined the peer effects on adolescent BMI by using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (98).,0
"This study found an effect of social networks on obesity in adolescents, and the effect was more pronounced among girls and heavier adolescents.",0
Social networks seem to play a role in the spread of obesity in both adults and adolescents.,0
"Therefore, programs that target peer norms may be effective in preventing overweight in adolescents.",0
Cognitive development during adolescence should also be considered.,0
"Although the developmental stage of formal operational thought enables skills such as enhanced problem solving, decision making, and abstract reasoning (90), the underdeveloped prefrontal cortex (99) still leaves adolescents at risk for behaviors that may increase the risk of obesity.",0
"For example, adolescents tend to be prone to impulsivity and the fallacy of invincibility and to have problems considering long-term consequences of their behavior.",0
These factors can contribute to poor judgment when it comes to food selection and other health-related behaviors.,0
"Conclusions\nTraditional interventions for child and adolescent obesity often focus on the individual child, with or without family involvement, and include education, modification of diet, and increases in physical activity.",0
"Cognitive behavioral strategies are often used to help children make better decisions, solve problems, and monitor their own progress.",0
"A recent movement suggests minimizing screen time for youth because television, computers, and video games contribute to sedentary behavior.",0
"However, few obesity interventions show clinically or statistically significant weight loss beyond the intervention period (100), which suggests that new and more comprehensive interventions are needed.",0
"To counteract the growing incidence of obesity, interventions must adopt an approach that grasps the interplay of economic, social, behavioral, biomedical, and environmental influences.",0
"[""Such an approach would have to encompass emerging knowledge about how obesity is the consequence of complex factors acting at many stages throughout a person's lifetime.""]",0
"The challenge of intervening in the obesity epidemic becomes even more daunting with the realization that, in children and adolescents, these influences must be considered separately at each stage of development.",0
This overview of the developmental influences on childhood overweight and obesity suggests opportunities for intervention.,0
"To combat prenatal influences on child obesity, pregnant women should be strongly discouraged from smoking and encouraged to consume a diet low in fat with adequate protein.",0
"Additionally, breast-feeding may decrease the risk of overweight, particularly in children born to overweight mothers.",0
"Because women are more motivated to change behaviors during pregnancy and immediately postpartum, these intervals can be targeted to shape eating patterns of both mother and child.",0
"Interventions to prevent child and adolescent obesity should focus on multiple settings, including the home and school.",0
"Further research should investigate variables in family relationships, the home, and the extended environment that influence eating.",0
Schools can intervene by offering healthy food choices in their breakfast and lunch programs and vending machines.,0
Empowering families and schools and giving them resources to engage in obesity prevention efforts and to provide environments that support healthy behaviors are critical issues that governments and social institutions need to address.,0
"Pre- and Postnatal Nutritional Histories Influence Reproductive Maturation and Ovarian Function in the Rat\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nWhile prepubertal nutritional influences appear to play a role in sexual maturation, there is a need to clarify the potential contributions of maternal and childhood influences in setting the tempo of reproductive maturation.",0
In the present study we employed an established model of nutritional programming to evaluate the relative influences of prenatal and postnatal nutrition on growth and ovarian function in female offspring.,0
"[""Results\nWe report that in the female rat, pubertal timing and subsequent ovarian function is influenced by the animal's nutritional status in utero , with both maternal caloric restriction and maternal high fat nutrition resulting in early pubertal onset.""]",0
"[""Depending on the offspring's nutritional history during the prenatal and lactational periods, subsequent nutrition and body weight gain did not further influence offspring reproductive tempo, which was dominated by the effect of prenatal nutrition.""]",0
"Whereas maternal calorie restriction leads to early pubertal onset, it also leads to a reduction in adult progesterone levels later in life.",0
"In contrast, we found that maternal high fat feeding which also induces early maturation in offspring was associated with elevated progesterone concentrations.",0
Conclusions\nThese observations are suggestive of two distinct developmental pathways leading to the acceleration of pubertal timing but with different consequences for ovarian function.,0
We suggest different adaptive explanations for these pathways and for their relationship to altered metabolic homeostasis.,0
"Introduction\nThe past century has seen a dramatic decline in the age of menarche: in Europe the age of menarche has fallen from 17 to ∼12.5 years of age[1]–[5], although the rate of decline is slowing[6],[7].",0
"This fall is usually attributed to improvements in child health and nutrition since the early 19thcentury, when the age of menarche was highest.",0
"This led to the hypothesis that the age of menarche is directly linked to a critical degree of body fat[8]; however although prepubertal nutrition and the age of puberty are certainly associated in some way, this concept did not stand up to critical analysis of the data[9].",0
"Data in humans suggest the possibility that complex interactions between prenatal and postnatal events influence the timing of puberty within one generation[2],[10],[11].",0
"In the 1948 UK birth cohort, both being born smaller and accelerated weight gain in childhood led to independent and interactive effects on the age of menarche[12], and we have recently confirmed this observation in an Australian cohort[13].",0
"Opposing influences of prenatal and postnatal growth have previously been described for adrenarche[14], central fat distribution[15]and insulin sensitivity at age 8 years[16].",0
"In data derived from adoption studies[17],[18], young girls who migrated from underprivileged countries to developed countries entered puberty significantly earlier than girls who remained in their country of origin[19],[20], and in unrelated studies such children have shown persistent differences in ovarian function later in life[11].",0
"It has been argued that the effects of intrauterine cues such as prenatal undernutrition on later metabolic function have an adaptive origin[21], in that they are a result of evolved processes designed to maintain reproductive fitness across a range of potential environments.",0
"[22]have proposed that the fetus uses nutritional signals (and/or changes in the endocrine environment) to anticipate its future energetic environment, and through developmental plasticity adjusts its phenotype accordingly[23],[24].",0
"[""In this regard, developmental plasticity would confer a phenotype that is better suited for the environment and thereby increase the organism's chances of reproducing successfully.""]",0
"Life history theory links earlier ages of maturation to ecological circumstances including energy availability, risks of predation and other causes of extrinsic mortality[25].",0
"Part of an adaptive response to early life nutritional challenge might therefore be expected to be an acceleration in the age of reproductive maturation, provided that the organism can metabolically sustain earlier reproduction without further compromising its own viability.",0
"In general, life history concepts suggest that poor nutrition or threatening circumstances in early life lead to accelerated maturation, through which the organism trades body size and longevity for earlier reproduction in a threatening environment[26].",0
"There are a wealth of data showing that in the rat, compromising early life signals such as maternal undernutrition or glucocorticoid exposure lead to offspring that develop a deleterious metabolic phenotype; including obesity, with both peripheral components such as sarcopenia and insulin resistance, and central components including hyperphagia, a preference for fatty foods and altered willingness to exercise[27]–[29].",0
"More recently, the effects of relative ‘overnutrition’ have come into question.",0
"Of current concern in developed countries are the rising rates of obesity[30]and gestational diabetes, both of which produce offspring who develop obesity[31]–[35].",0
"While it has been suggested that body fat and therefore childhood nutrition per se play a direct role in determining the age of pubertal onset[36],[37], the effects of an intrauterine obesogenic environment have not been considered.",0
"The overall aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of differing nutritional exposures (standard rat chow, high fat or caloric restriction) during intrauterine and early postnatal life on pubertal onset and ovarian function in female rat offspring.",0
"Additionally, we investigated whether a lifetime of high fat consumption by the dam has differing effects compared to high fat consumption that is restricted to pregnancy and lactation.",0
"We evaluated growth, timing of reproductive maturation and adult ovarian function.",0
"We report that early life caloric restriction, either before birth or during lactation, consistently accelerates the age of maturation.",0
"Although we report that the combination of prenatal caloric restriction and postnatal high fat nutrition also advanced the age at puberty, this was not directly linked to body weight at puberty.",0
"Intriguingly, maternal high fat consumption also accelerated reproductive maturation in female offspring, but here a post-weaning high fat diet had limited additional effect.",0
"We also present data indicating that these two early life nutritional exposures had differential effects on later life ovarian function, suggestive of two developmental pathways that affect the tempo of reproductive maturation in the rat.",0
"Comparatively, maternal high fat nutrition led to a small but significant (p<0.05) reduction in birth weight compared to Cont (Figure 1B).",0
There was a further significant (p<0.05) reduction in birth weight of female offspring born to PLHF dams compared to MHF and Cont offspring.,0
"In contrast to calorie restricted offspring, these pups regained their weight and by day 12 (MHF) or day 14 (PLHF) surpassed controls in both weight and rate of weight gain, reflective of a significantly altered growth trajectory (Figure 1D).",0
Pubertal onset and adult ovarian function is dependent on maternal nutritional background\n\nPubertal onset in control offspring\nPubertal age of offspring born to control dams was similar to that reported previously[38].,0
"Maternal nutrient restriction during pregnancy and/or lactation significantly advanced pubertal age in female offspring to a similar degree (p<0.01,figure 2A;Table 1).",0
"In calorie restricted offspring (UNP, UNL, UNPL), a post-weaning HF diet further advanced the age at puberty (p<0.001;Figure 2B, C, D;Table 1) compared to those offspring who were normally nourished in utero and fed a HF diet post-weaning (Table 1).10.1371/journal.pone.0006744.g002\n\nCaption (FIG): FIGURE 2\nPercentage of offspring entering puberty over time in animals whose dams received 50% of normal nutrition.",0
"A post-weaning HF diet significantly increased progesterone concentrations in Cont and UN animals (p<0.05,Figure 4C), although in UNL offspring these differences did not reach statistical significance.",0
"Maternal consumption of a HF diet resulted in adult offspring progesterone concentrations that were significantly higher than those of offspring born to Cont dams (p<0.05;Figure 4B), although in MHF offspring these differences did not reach statistical significance.",0
Weight at puberty\nOffspring that were exposed to altered maternal nutrition (either maternal undernutrition or high fat diet) all showed significantly lower body weights at pubertal onset compared to Cont offspring (p<0.05;Table 1).,0
"Discussion\nThese data demonstrate that intrauterine, lactational and post-weaning nutritional histories make differential contributions to the age of puberty in the female rat, and lead to persistent effects on ovarian function extending into adulthood.",0
"While a post-weaning high fat diet had the effect of accelerating puberty, this was restricted to only those offspring of control dams or those born to dams that were calorie restricted, and in calorie restricted offspring this effect was relatively small compared to that of early life nutrition.",0
"Maternal undernutrition\nFetal growth restriction as a consequence of impaired intrauterine conditions can be interpreted as part of a life history strategy in which the organism anticipates a shorter life because of a higher risk of extrinsic mortality, and therefore invests less into growth but accelerates maturation to ensure reproductive fitness[10],[36],[39]–[41].",0
"Consistent with this, we observed that both prenatal and lactational undernutrition accelerated puberty – although only the former was accompanied by the later development of obesity and other components of metabolic compromise, as previously reported[29].",0
"The shift towards an earlier puberty may represent a life course strategy[10]intended to preserve fitness[36],[41]by reducing the risk of death before reproducing, or by allowing a greater number of successful reproductive episodes before death.",0
We speculate that the well reported phenomenon of metabolic programming as a result of poor prenatal nutrition might be a secondary outcome of a life history strategy to accelerate maturation.,0
"A fitness advantage would be obtained only if there were sufficient nutrient stores to support earlier reproduction, and an integrated adaptive response would thus require both accelerated puberty and altered metabolism.",0
"However, an accelerated reproductive tempo may not be maintained in the face of later nutritional constraints.",0
"There may be a postnatal override such that if energetics remain poor during postnatal life, reproductive maturation may be delayed until the nutritional environment is improved sufficiently to support a first pregnancy.",0
"Using a similar experimental paradigm, we have previously demonstrated that prenatal undernutrition in a rodent model was associated with a prepubertal increase in food intake[29]and alterations in epigenetic regulation of and mRNA levels of hepatic genes to favour lipogenesis[42].",0
"Taken together, our observations could suggest that the prenatal undernutrition-induced acceleration in pubertal onset observed in the present study may contribute to a significant drive to alter metabolic capacity.",0
"These data therefore may be consistent with clinical observations that that lower but normal birth weight followed by accelerated weight gain up to age 8 is associated with earlier menarche[12],[13].",0
Mechanisms regulating pubertal onset are no doubt multifactorial.,0
"Leptin is a permissive neuro-regulatory factor for the onset of puberty[43],[44].",0
"It synchronizes growth and fertility with periods of either adequate or inadequate food availability[45]; post-weaning treatment with leptin accelerates puberty in rodents[46],[47], and leptin in the rat neonate affects hypothalamic maturation[48].",0
"Since in the present study neonatal growth trajectories in pups that were exposed to maternal undernutrition began to deviate from those of control pups at a time that coincides with a neonatal surge in circulating leptin concentrations, which itself is nutritionally influenced[49],[50], leptin may be a central driver in initiating maturational changes.",0
This is consistent with our previous observations that these offspring have altered leptin regulation and are hyperleptinemic as adults[51].,0
"Indeed those offspring, for which maternal calorie restriction was extended into lactation, did not show obesity as adults, but still displayed accelerated reproductive maturation.",0
"The observation that lactational undernutrition can lead to a modification of the adult metabolic phenotype is compatible with work by others showing that postnatal undernutrition can modify metabolic programming[52],[53].",0
It does appear however that such modification does not reverse the altered tempo of reproductive maturation in programmed offspring.,0
"Using a life-history interpretation, adaptive developmental responses to environmental cues may be graded; according to the severity of the stress experienced[22],[54]–[56].",0
The differing outcomes between each of the perinatal undernutrition approaches reported here are likely to reflect these confounders of severity and timing.,0
Maternal high fat exposure\nWe found that exposure to a high fat diet either throughout the lifetime of the mother or restricted to pregnancy and/or lactation led to early pubertal onset.,0
These findings are compatible with a previous report of early puberty following high fat nutrition during pregnancy[57].,0
"High fat perinatal nutrition advanced the age at puberty to the same degree as did post-weaning high fat nutrition in control offspring, and intriguingly the addition of a high fat postnatal diet following high fat prenatal nutrition had no further effect on pubertal age.",0
"Therefore, nutritionally-induced accelerated reproductive maturation following high fat exposure may not be limited to one distinct critical developmental window.",0
"In our model, early life signals of high fat nutritional conditions led to accelerated maturation.",0
"We have previously shown that offspring of dams fed a high fat diet throughout life (including during pregnancy and lactation) show accelerated weight gain in postnatal life, independent of postnatal diet[58].",0
"In the present study, offspring of nutritionally challenged dams develop obesity; thus a perpetuation and possibly a compounding of accelerated pubertal onset may ensue in the next generation as these offspring will themselves be fatter at an earlier reproductive age.",0
"Ovarian function\nMaternal exposure to either caloric restriction or to high fat nutrition was associated with accelerated puberty in female offspring, but there were distinct differences in mature ovarian function as measured by progesterone concentrations in the proestrous phase.",0
"The study design did not allow for a direct measure of reproductive performance, however, high salivary progesterone concentrations in women is associated with greater ovulation rates and ovulatory events are associated with childhood and adult environmental and ecological factors[58].",0
"Although we did not measure reproductive performance, we speculate that the higher progesterone concentrations observed may be associated with better functioning of the corpora lutea.",0
We recognise however that the influence of central gonadal drivers cannot be discounted.,0
"In contrast to MHF and PLHF offspring, those born to dams that were undernourished during pregnancy showed lower adult circulating progesterone concentrations.",0
"In life history terms, the trade-off for those born to dams undernourished during pregnancy may be an earlier maturation but a faster decline in ovarian function with aging, associated with significantly reduced adult progesterone levels.",0
"There are data that suggest that at least in mice, aging per se may be accelerated in offspring of poorly nourished dams.",0
"[59]have reported that prenatal undernutrition, in contrast to postnatal undernutrition, leads to reduced longevity in mice.",0
"In our study, while puberty was accelerated in maternal high fat exposed offspring, ovarian function was maintained or enhanced into adult life.",0
"We speculate that whereas pubertal onset was accelerated in the UNP group to maintain some potential for reproduction in an environment predicted to have a higher mortality risk, in the HF offspring maturation was accelerated to opportunistically enhance fitness.",0
"Finally, while the use of rodent models for reproductive investigation is generally well accepted, a number of differences must be recognized.",0
"Rodents for instance have short reproductive cycles closely linked with circadian rhythms, and do not experience menses or true “menopause” as a result of follicular depletion as typically observed in humans, although follicular depletion does occur.",0
"Although we accept that rodents and humans may differ in their adaptive responses to early life cues, there are many reports outlining associations between a suboptimal early life environment and altered phenotype in both species[60],[61].",0
"Conclusions\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that in the rat, pre- and postnatal nutritional histories together influence both ovarian function and the tempo of reproductive maturation in female offspring.",0
"In our study, both maternal high fat nutrition and diminished maternal calorie intake impacted on female offspring reproductive maturation resulting in early pubertal onset, most likely through two different, potentially adaptive, pathways.",0
"We speculate that our findings may imply adaptive responses to early life cues predicted by a life-history approach, although confirmation of these predictions requires further studies to assess reproductive fitness.",0
Future studies will elucidate the long term effects of maternal nutrition on offspring reproductive capability and to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying early pubertal onset.,0
"On the aetiology of autism\nI have suggested that the primary environmental trigger for autism is not vaccinations, toxins or infections, but gestational and early childhood vitamin D deficiency (1,2).",0
"Subsequently, the title of an article in Scientific American recently asked, ‘What if vitamin D deficiency is a cause of autism?’ (3) Since then, an article on vitamin D and autism in Acta Paediatrica (4) and the accompanying commentary (5) have added to the accelerating suspicion that vitamin D deficiency – either during pregnancy or early childhood – may be an environmental trigger for the genetic disease of autism.",0
"Instead, I concentrate on papers either published since my paper, or on evidence I overlooked when researching the original paper.",0
"Finally, I explain my reasons why this theory deserves immediate attempts to disprove it.",0
"Simultaneous with the above two Acta Paediatrica publications, a paper elsewhere reported that among 117 adult psychiatric outpatients is Sweden with various diagnoses, the 10 patients with autism had the lowest vitamin D levels of any of the groups studied, a mean of 12 ng/mL (31 nM), approaching the osteomalacic range for adults and the rachitic range for children (6).",0
"Even more interesting, some of the patients seemed to improve when treated with an average dose of about 4000 IU of vitamin D/day.",0
The authors did not say if the improvement occurred in the autism group.,0
A 2008 review detailed the devastating effect gestational vitamin D deficiency has on developing mammalian brains (7).,0
"Unfortunately, the tiny 10 μg (400 IU) dose in prenatal vitamins is virtually irrelevant in preventing the current epidemic of gestational vitamin D deficiency (8).",0
"For this reason, in 2007, the Canadian Paediatric Society cautioned pregnant women they may require not 400 IU/day but 2000 IU/day, or more, to prevent gestational vitamin D deficiency (9).",0
"If adequate amounts of vitamin D prevent autism, one would expect children with rickets to have an increased risk of autism.",0
"To my knowledge, the neuropsychiatric symptoms of rickets have not been studied in the modern era.",0
"However, at least two old papers have addressed it (10,11), both published before Kanner described autism in 1943.",0
"Both papers describe ‘weak mindedness,’‘feeble minds,’‘mental dullness,’ unresponsiveness and developmental delays.",0
"Even more intriguing, both papers report that the mental condition in rickets improved with vitamin D.\nAnother of the mysteries of autism is the apparent increased incidence of autism in the children of richer college-educated parents, especially women, a finding announced a few months ago (12).",0
"Actually, this is not a new finding.",0
"As I discussed in my original paper, this has been known since the early 1980s but was dismissed as being because of ascertainment bias.",0
"This very recent report correlates well with a 2007 CDC report (13), which found a similar increased risk for the wealthy and well-educated, findings the authors tried but could not dismiss as being because of ascertainment bias.",0
"If the vitamin D theory is true, autism should be more common in richer well-educated mothers, who are more likely than other mothers to practice sun avoidance and use sunblock (1,2).",0
"In his invited commentary, Dr. Eyles asked, ‘Does skin colour modify the risk’ of autism, noting melanin in the skin is an effective sunblock.",0
Such studies are difficult as they raise sensitive social issues.,0
"Nevertheless, three of four recent U.S. studies found a higher incidence of autism in black children, sometimes appreciably higher (1,2).",0
"report, the Somali immigrants in Sweden call autism the ‘Swedish disease’ and Somali immigrants in Minnesota call it the ‘American disease,’ but in equatorial Somalia, autism has no name.",0
Toxins delivered by water or air pollution appear to damage the genome of the vitamin D deficient (14).,0
"If exposure to such toxins were the main contributors to autism incidence, then we should have seen an autism incidence pattern in the US that mirrored air and water pollution with a dramatic increase in the 1950s, a peak in the 1960s and then a progressive decline by the early 1980s, coincident with enactment and enforcement of the US clean air and clean water acts of the 1960s.",0
"Another possibility is that air pollution from Eastern Europe, India and China, which has been increasing in the last 20 years, has engendered the current crop of autism.",0
"However, why would foreign air pollution of today do what American air pollution of the 1950s and 60s could not?",0
Another paper published after my original paper found that autistic boys have unexplained reductions in metacarpal bone thickness (15).,0
"At some time in their life, these children laid down less cortical bone than normal children, a finding consistent with undetected and untreated childhood or even intrauterine vitamin D deficiency.",0
Yet another recent paper reported that the prevalence of autism in three U.S. states was higher in areas of higher precipitation and clouds (16).,0
"The 2005 autism prevalence rate among school-aged children, after controlling for differences in population size, demographic characteristics, per capita income and state, was higher in cloudy areas.",0
"The association of autism prevalence and the mean annual precipitation received by a county between 1987 and 2001 was positive and significant (p = 0.0034; 95% confidence interval, 0.0018–0.0050).",0
"Surprisingly, high maternal seafood consumption, of the type known to be contaminated with mercury, has been associated with fewer – not more – autistic markers in the offspring (17).",0
"Lower maternal seafood intake during pregnancy was associated with low verbal intelligence quotient, suboptimum outcomes for prosocial behaviour, fine motor, communication and social development scores.",0
"While the omega-3 and mercury content of fish is well known, less well known is the fact that fish is one of the few foods with significant amounts of vitamin D, which, as referenced earlier, protects the genome from damage by toxins.",0
"While the urban/rural gradient in rickets is well known and was one of the keys to discovering that sunlight prevented rickets, less well known is a meta-analysis showing a twofold urban/rural gradient for autism (18).",0
"Similar to rickets, city life affords less vitamin D, because of tall buildings, indoor occupations and increased urban air pollution, all of which block ultraviolet B light from penetrating the atmosphere.",0
"Finally, a 2008 paper reported that autism was more common among mothers who took antiepileptic drugs (19).",0
"A comment to the authors (20) detailed the evidence that antiepileptic drugs are one of the few classes of drugs that consistently and significantly interfere with vitamin D metabolism, lowering 25(OH)D levels.",0
"I agree with Dr Eyles’ comment that the vitamin D theory is ‘highly parsimonious.’ Indeed, it was love of parsimony that led me to first hypothesize that vitamin D is intimately involved in the pathology and epidemiology of both autism and influenza (21).",0
Some have speculated that the excess of winter births in autism is explained by wintertime maternal viral infections.,0
"Obviously, another, and more parsimonious explanation, is that vitamin D is involved in all three.",0
The vitamin D theory of autism does not diminish genetic contributions to autism occurrence.,0
"Indeed, without the genetic tendency for autism, I suspect that severe maternal or early childhood vitamin D deficiency may cause bone abnormalities, as referenced above, with no evidence autism.",0
"All that the current epidemic of maternal and early childhood vitamin D deficiency does, with its resultant neural deficiency in the pluripotent neurosteroid calcitriol, is to allow the genetic tendency for autism to express itself.",0
"If this theory is true, the path towards effective prevention – and perhaps a treatment effect if adequate physiological doses of vitamin D are given – is so simple, so safe, so inexpensive, so readily available and so easy, that it defies imagination.",0
"Seventeen vitamin D experts recently stated, ‘In our opinion, children with chronic illnesses such as autism, diabetes and/or frequent infections should be supplemented with higher doses of sunshine or vitamin D3, doses adequate to maintain their 25(OH)D levels in the mid-normal of the reference range [65 ng/mL (162 nmol/L)] – and should be so supplemented year round.’ (22)\nFinally, if true, a darker side of the theory emerges.",0
"To some real but unknown extent, autism is an iatrogenic disease, caused by governments, organizations, committees, newspapers and physicians who promulgated the current warnings about sun-exposure for pregnant women and young children without any understanding of the tragedy they engendered.",0
"A Comparative Study of 25 (OH) Vitamin D Serum Levels in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis and Control Group in Isfahan, Iran\n\nAbstract\n\nObjectives:\nThere is no study about correlation between vitamin D serum level and multiple sclerosis (MS) in Iran.",0
"So in this survey, we investigated the serum level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in MS patients and compared it with controls in central region of Iran, an area with medium to high risk for MS disease, in spite of high sun exposure.",0
"Also, our study showed significant discrepancy between the two groups according to the rate of deficiency, insufficiency and normal range of vitamin D categories (P=0.021).",0
"Conclusions:\nWe found the same results as those studies carried out in Europe and North America; i.e., lower serum vitamin D level in MS patients than that in normal population, in spite of sufficient sun exposure in Isfahan region.",0
"INTRODUCTION\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic probably with autoimmune basis and uncertain etiology characterized by demyelinative and inflammatory physiopathology causing axonal damages.12This disease affects females more than males with ordinary 10 years relapsing-remitting course and secondary progressive phase.2On histological basis, T helper cells type 1 (Th1) is the most responsible cause for pathologies seen in MS.1–3There are multiple risk factors for MS in a complex relationship with each other from genetic ones to environmental factors but exact mechanism leading to MS has remained unclear yet.45From guessed environmental risk factors for MS, past infection with EBV, smoking and low serum level of vitamin D are more favorable.67The most important vitamin in calcium and phosphor homeostasis is vitamin D. This vitamin has proposed potential power for modulating immune system.48This is achieved via enhancing the phagocytic function of monocytes9and decreasing the secretion of IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α and PGE2 by monocytes.10Also, immature or semi mature APC’s cannot mature in presence of 1,25 (OH)2D.8Many studies showed a role of paracrine function and nerve growth factor synthesis of vitamin D in CNS and also, showed that deficiency of this vitamin in pregnancy period can cause neural system disorder in animal cases.811–14Then, vitamin D has a near relation with MS and the results of different studies can be summarized as follows: First, the effect of latitude via exposure to sun light and serum level of vitamin D on MS prevalence, that increases with distance from equator, with only one exception in Norway.23815Second, Vander et al.",0
"showed that sun exposure in childhood period prevents from MS.16Third, it seems low risk of MS in white population is associated with high serum level of vitamin D or high oral intake via supplements or oily fish in some studies.217–19Fourth, it have been shown that vitamin D can be a protective agent against experimental autoimmune encephalitis in mice (like MS in humans).48Finally, some scientists administered 100-1700 IU/day vitamin D supplements in MS patients and observed the reduction of relapses.20–22The candidate for estimating serum level of vitamin D is 25-hydroxy vitamin D, because of its prolonged half-life.823–25It is used to assess an individual’s overall vitamin D nutritional status, because its formation, unlike that of 1, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D, is not tightly regulated and it has a relatively long half-life (20-60 days).",0
"There are differences in optimal level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D but nowadays internationally accepted normal range is between 75 nmol/L and 200 nmol/L, and we consider serum level below 75 nmol/L and below 2 nmol/L as insufficiency and deficiency, respectively.42325Even it seems to achieve the prevention of autoimmune diseases, the serum level of vitamin D must be higher than the level required to reduce osteoporosis (higher than 75 nmol/L).4In attention to high prevalence of MS in Iran and especially in Isfahan which is about 43.5/100,0002627and given that Iran is located in an latitude of 32° 50’ and longitude of 51° 43’ with enough sun exposure and because nobody investigated the relationship between vitamin D, as an environmental agent, and MS disease in Iran before, we decided to compare the serum level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in MS patients and healthy control group in Isfahan region.",0
"The mean level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in case and control groups were 48 and 62 nmol/L, respec-tively, and it showed a significant difference between them (P=0.036).There was not any significant relationship between age and serum level of vitamin D in both groups (P=0.83).",0
This study showed a significant relationship between serum levels of vitamin D between the two groups (P=0.021).,0
"DISCUSSION\nWe found the same results as studies in Europe and North America, which implicates lower serum vitamin D level in MS patients than in normal population, in spite of sufficient sun exposure in Isfahan region.23815The hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for MS was first proposed over 30 years ago4and gained credibility after the discovery of the immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D.5Moreover, in the past few years, the epidemiological evidence of an increased MS risk among individuals with low vitamin D concentrations has achieved substantial strength.",0
"Relative to sun exposure, diet is a poor source of colecalciferol, providing only 40-400 IU per food serving,12whereas whole-body UVB exposure for 20 min for a light-skinned person during the summer months will produce at least 10,000 IU.713However, increased skin pigmentation, age, use of sunscreen, built environment, and environmental factors that reduce the strength of UVB reaching the earth’s surface (e.g., winter season, high latitude, pollution, cloud cover, and ozone levels) all contribute to reduce skin colecalciferol production to the point at which diet might become the primary source.7–14Because melanin pigment in human skin absorbs UVB,28black people have lower 25 hydroxyvitamin D concentrations than white people, and are often vitamin D deficient.21However, the risk of MS in black people is lower than in white people (because of genetic differences).28Analyses of the relation between vitamin D status and MS risk are therefore better done separately within each race/ethnic group.",0
The importance of age of exposure and seasonality is uncertain.,0
"Studies in migrants implicate postnatal environmental exposures, but do not exclude prenatal effects.1529Blood concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D fluctuate with season, but the etiological relevance of these fluctuations to MS risk is unknown.",0
"The reasons why vitamin D deficiency is thought to be a risk factor for MS are as follows: First, MS frequency increases with increasing latitude, which is strongly inversely correlated with duration and intensity of UVB from sunlight and vitamin D concentrations.2830–35Second, prevalence of MS is lower than expected at high latitudes in populations with high consumption of vitamin-D-rich fatty fish43536.",0
"Third, MS risk seems to decrease with migration from high to low latitudes.15If vitamin D had any effect on MS risk, we would expect MS incidence to decrease with increasing 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations.",0
"The only study satisfying this condition used a nested case-control design to sample an underlying prospective cohort comprising over 7 million individuals who served in the US military and had at least two serum samples stored in the US Department of Defense Serum Repository.18The study concluded that serum concentration of 25 hydroxyvitamin D in healthy young white adults is an important predictor of their risk of developing MS, independently from their place of birth and latitude of residence during childhood.18In a prospective investigation comprising approximately 200,000 women in the USA, vitamin D intake was measured every 4 years by a comprehensive semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire.37The incidence of MS during the 30-year follow-up decreased with increasing vitamin D intake (P=0.03 for trend) and was 33% lower among women in the highest quintile of vitamin D intake versus those in the lowest quintile.17Furthermore, MS incidence was 41% lower among women taking 400 IU per day or more from supplements compared with non-users.17Attempts to relate vitamin D intake to MS risk have also been made in casecontrol studies.",0
"In Norway, a study comprising 119 MS cases and 251 controls living above the Arctic Circle, where fatty fish is a major contributor to vitamin D intake, reported a lower risk of MS for individuals who ate fish three or more times per week at 16–20 years of age compared with those with a lower consumption (odds ratio=0.57 [95%CI 0.33-0.93]; P=0.024).19Supplementation with codliver oil was also associated with lower risk of MS, but only among individuals with low summer outdoor activity.",0
"In relation to sun exposure and related measures, one of these studies, which comprised 136 individuals with MS and 272 age and sex-matched controls in Tasmania,16collected information on sun exposure at different ages.",0
The odds ratios of MS among individuals who reported spending at least 2 hours per day in the sun during holidays and at weekends at ages 6-10 years were 0.47 (95%CI 0.26-0.84) for winter and 0.50 (0.24-1.02) for exposure; inverse but weaker associations were observed with sun exposure at older ages.,0
"Non-melanoma skin cancer and, less strongly, melanoma are more common in individuals with high levels of sun exposure.",0
"Thus, if vitamin D was protective, these cancers would be expected to be rare among individuals with MS.",0
"In fact, a lower than expected occurrence of skin cancer was reported among individuals with MS in a study in the UK.38Month of birth has also been suggested as a factor that affects MS risk.",0
"In a pooled analysis of data from Canada, UK, Denmark, and Sweden including more than 40,000 individuals with MS, significantly fewer (8.5%) people with MS were born in November and significantly more (9.1%) were born in May.39This finding suggests that prenatal exposures or exposures in the first months of life could be important in MS etiology, but the link to vitamin D is unclear.",0
"Genes also can affect vitamin D metabolism, skin color, and behavior, all of which can influence circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations.",0
"Furthermore, genetic variations in vitamin-D-related and other genes might influence the effects of vitamin D on the immune system.",0
"Therefore, genetic variations in vitamin-D-related genes might also affect MS risk, either directly or by modifying the effects of vitamin D.40\nOur implications for future research and MS prevention and according to the basis of the results of the only longitudinal study of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and MS onset,18and assum-ing that these results are unbiased and vitamin D is truly protective against MS, over 70% of MS cases in the USA and Europe could be prevented by increasing the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration of adolescents and young adults to above 100 nmol/L.4142These concentrations are commonly found only in individuals with outdoor lifestyles in sunny regions, but could be reached in most people by taking 1000-4000 IU colecalciferol daily.8254344Although these doses are largely considered safe and potentially beneficial for other outcomes,819confirmation of safety and efficacy in a large randomized trial is needed before making general recommendations.",0
"One option would be a national or multinational study based on randomization of school districts or other suitable units in regions of low sunlight intensity, perhaps including multiple outcomes that might be affected by vitamin D, such as diabetes, obesity, respiratory infections, and asthma.4546Alternatively, high-risk first-degree relatives of individu-als with MS could be targeted in a smaller trial,47although randomization and compliance could be more challenging.",0
"In either design, contamination of the control group would be a potential concern.",0
"CONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, this study showed that serum vitamin D deficiency might be a potential environmental predisposing factor for developing multiple sclerosis in our region, and need to follow factors that cause this problem including dietary, genetic, and other ones.",0
"Whereas future observational epidemiological studies and genetic and molecular investigations will be useful to strengthen and refine the hypothesis, it might be necessary to do a large randomized trial to establish the safety and efficacy needed to promote large-scale vitamin D supplementation.",0
"A test of the hypothesis that vitamin D could reduce MS risk will require the administration of relatively high doses of vitamin D to hundreds of thousands of young adults for several years, and careful monitoring for unforeseen adverse effects is mandatory.",0
We suggest that an international multidisciplinary working group to be set up to oversee the design of future prevention or supplementation studies.,0
"Furthermore, screening of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations is likely to identify a large proportion of patients who are vitamin D deficient or insufficient, and who might benefit from vitamin D supplementation for prevention of osteoporosis and other complications, especially multiple sclerosis.",0
"Weekly Iron-Folic Acid Supplementation with Regular Deworming Is Cost-Effective in Preventing Anaemia in Women of Reproductive Age in Vietnam\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nTo estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of a project administering de-worming and weekly iron-folic acid supplementation to control anaemia in women of reproductive age in Yen Bai province, Vietnam.",0
"Methods and Findings\nCost effectiveness was evaluated using data on programmatic costs based on two surveys in 2006 and 2009 and impact on anaemia and iron status collected in 2006, 2007, and 2008.",0
"Based on estimated productivity gains for adult women, the benefit:cost ratio is 6.7∶1.",0
Conclusion\nThe study shows that weekly iron-folic acid supplementation and regular de-worming is a low-cost and cost-effective intervention and would be appropriate for population-based introduction in settings with a high prevalence of anaemia and iron deficiency and low malaria infection rates.,0
Introduction\nWHO estimates suggest that globally up to 500 million women of reproductive age suffer from anaemia.,0
Women and children are most vulnerable due to greater iron requirements and those in resource constrained countries are particularly at risk[1].,0
"Severe maternal anaemia increases the risk of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity while less severe anaemia and iron deficiency have been linked to sub-optimal fetal growth, premature birth and low birth weight, as well as iron deficiency in infants[2]–[4]which may impair cognitive development[5].",0
"[""On a broader scale the reduced capacity for work and education due to anaemia and iron deficiency can adversely impact a population's social and economic development[6].""]",0
WHO guidelines recommend daily iron supplementation for pregnant women and children 6–24 months where anaemia rates are 40% or more[7].,0
A recent international expert consultation organized by WHO went further and recommended weekly supplementation with iron and folic acid for all non-pregnant women of reproductive age in areas where anaemia prevalence is greater than 20%[8].,0
A systematic review of 25 original studies concluded that this approach of weekly iron and folic acid supplementation was safe and also effective in improving haemoglobin concentration in women of reproductive age[9].,0
"However, there is no data on cost and cost-effectiveness of population-based weekly supplementation programs, and limited data on other nutritional supplementation programs.",0
"In Vietnam, there has been an increasing awareness of nutritional deficiencies and anaemia, particularly in rural populations.",0
"A national survey in 2000 found anaemia rates were 24.3% for non-pregnant women nationally (26.3% in rural areas), and 32.2% in pregnant women (33.8% in rural areas)[10].",0
"Contributing factors included lack of variety in the diet associated with low income, compounded by high rates of infection with soil-transmitted helminths, particularly hookworm.",0
"A study of pregnant women in the rural central highlands in 2001 identified anaemia prevalence in pregnant women, post-partum women and non-pregnant women of 53%, 62% and 54% respectively[11].",0
As a consequence the Vietnam National Nutrition Strategy 2011–2020 has the reduction of iron deficiency anemia in children less than 5 years of age and reproductive-age women as an objective.,0
However the costs of potential strategies for achieving this are currently unknown.,0
"We report here the cost and cost-effectiveness of the de-worming and weekly iron-folic acid intervention, which has now been delivered to women in Yen Bai province since May 2006.",0
"[""The impact of the program on women's iron and helminth infection status in the first 12 months was assessed using structured questionnaires, stool examination and haemoglobin assessment at the field site, and blood sample analysis for ferritin, soluble Transferrin Receptor and C-Reactive Protein (to identify the presence of acute infection).""]",0
"[""With evidence of the program's positive impact on women's iron status the weekly supplement program with twice-yearly de-worming was scaled up to province level (with an estimated target group of 250,000 women of reproductive age) commencing March 2008.""]",0
"[""The effectiveness of the distribution system and women's compliance were assessed by an independent Non-Government Organization at 10 weeks and 18 and 36 months post-implementation.""]",0
"[""Structured questionnaires were administered to assess the availability of supplements at each level of the distribution chain and women's attitude about, and their history of, taking the supplements[13].""]",0
"In addition, participating women were surveyed to assess their estimate of costs involved in accessing the supplements.",0
"Personnel costs were imputed based on information obtained from interviews with district, commune and village health workers about their total salary and the proportion of time they spent on this intervention.",0
"Assuming that anaemia cases prevented is the measure of effectiveness, the cost-effectiveness of the intervention is USD 4.24 per anaemia case prevented (USD133900 / (175581×18)).",0
"These authors estimate that the productivity gains for an individual removed from anaemia are 5% in manual occupations (70% of employment in a country such as Viet Nam), and 17% in heavy manual occupations (which form 12.7% of employment in manual occupations in Viet Nam: the share of agriculture in GDP is 22.1%)[16].",0
"The estimated dollar value per capita of the productivity gains are calculated as USD1.29, i.e.",0
"Hence the benefit: cost ratio is approximately 6.7∶1, just based on improvements in productivity of women of reproductive age in the workforce.",0
This means that for each dollar invested in a weekly iron supplementation and de-worming program the monetary value in terms of productivity was USD6.70.,0
"There may be additional financial benefits associated with reductions in other health care costs such as those associated with reduced maternal and infant mortality, and a reduction in neural tube defects which cannot readily be quantified.",0
In addition there are possible effects on reduced anaemia in children and men associated with de-worming women of reproductive age and a consequent reduction in helminth transmission.10.1371/journal.pone.0023723.t003\n\nCaption (TABLE-WRAP): TABLE 3\nEffectiveness of the Yen Bai iron supplementation and de-worming program.SurveySample sizeHaemoglobin (g/L)Prevalence of anaemiaBaseline34912238%3 month57412627%12 month57213120%30 month30313019%\nData sourced from Casey et al[13].,0
"Discussion\nThe provision of iron-folic acid supplements on a weekly basis for women of reproductive age is aimed at improving iron stores, particularly prior to pregnancy and during the first trimester before women access ante-natal care.",0
Pre-pregnancy weekly supplements that contain folic acid may also decrease the risk of neural tube defects.,0
"A successful supplementation program must include training of health care system workers, provision of accessible educational materials for the target group and the broader community and a reliable distribution system.",0
Therefore these costs need to be incorporated into the overall cost of an intervention program.,0
We have demonstrated the effective uptake of weekly iron-folic acid supplementation by 70% of woman in Yen Bai province with an annual cost of USD 0.76/woman.,0
This compares to estimates by the National Institute of Nutrition that only 20% of pregnant women are covered by the national antenatal program of daily iron supplementation for which there is no costing.[18].,0
"The costing reported here includes distribution of supplements, health staff training, production and distribution of educational materials and regular monitoring.",0
The possible reasons for the higher uptake of the weekly supplements are many.,0
One likely reason for the difference is convenience.,0
Weekly supplements for women of reproductive age in the program reported here are accessed at village level.,0
The 2009 survey identified that it took women an average of 17 minutes to access the distribution point for weekly supplements.,0
Another reason for high compliance with the weekly program was the maintenance of a reliable supply.,0
A previous study has shown that a poor distribution system and irregular availability were the most significant environmental risk factors for taking iron supplementation continuously[19].,0
"Also, weekly supplements may be better tolerated, with less frequent side-effects thereby increasing acceptance and compliance.",0
"[""The extensive training and community education program was another positive factor which increased acceptance of the supplements as a valuable contribution to women's health.""]",0
The main limitation of the impact evaluation was the lack of a control arm where no intervention was given.,0
"However, we considered it unethical to withhold iron-folic acid supplementation and deworming from women of reproductive age over a long period of time given the evidence from short-term studies on the efficacy of weekly iron-folic acid supplementation[8].",0
"A previous study in Viet Nam followed women of reproductive age receiving weekly supplements, some of whom became pregnant at various points during the 12 months of follow-up.",0
Our study did not have a sample group large or accessible enough to allow an assessment of long-term pregnancy outcomes.,0
"With a larger sample, it would be possible to extend our calculations to estimate the cost per death averted with a reduction of the prevalence of severe anemia in pregnant women.",0
"The relative risk of mortality associated with a 10 g/L increase in hemoglobin is estimated as 0.75 for maternal mortality, and 0.72 for perinatal mortality[21].",0
"The annual cost of USD0.76 per woman treated is consistent with a cost estimate of USD10-13 per pregnancy[22],[23], since pregnant women receive more tablets.",0
"A recent trial in northern China identified an annual cost of USD40.00 to improve antenatal, delivery and postnatal care of which 22% (USD8.80) was to supply and distribute daily supplements to pregnant women[24].",0
Data on cost per pregnancy of daily iron supplementation is quite weak.,0
"For those countries in the Southeast Asia region (SearD) with high adult and child mortality rates, they estimate the cost as $10.12 (but as high as $46.04 per pregnancy in the low mortality countries in the Europe region, EurA).",0
"Behrman, Alderman and Hoddinott, 2004[23], cite estimates for Nepal of $13.14 per pregnancy (based on program estimates extrapolated from a research study).",0
The estimated benefit:cost ratio of 6.7∶1 is similar to the median benefit:cost ratio for iron fortification estimated by Horton and Ross[6]for a range of countries.,0
"Supplementation of women is more costly per person, but has a stronger effect on anaemia.",0
"[""However, fortification benefits both men and women while supplementation directly benefits only women and will only have large labour market benefits in countries where women's participation in the labour market is high.""]",0
"However, in Viet Nam fortification of cereals is not easily available for rural areas (rice, the main staple, is more costly to fortify, and less feasible to fortify given the lack of central processing).",0
There have been experiments with fortification of fish sauce however this is not yet on a commercial scale.,0
At present a supplementation program is the most feasible method for addressing iron and folate deficiencies in Viet Nam.,0
"The cost of coverage with weekly iron-folic acid is comparable to program estimates for distribution of other nutritional supplements such as twice-yearly vitamin A, and zinc.",0
"A recent survey[25]of the cost of micronutrient supplementation programs (both published and “grey” literature) identified 43 studies, of which 31 were for vitamin A, and the rest for iron (7), iodine (4) and zinc (1).",0
"Mean cost per beneficiary were calculated as USD1.95 (vitamin A), USD3.64 (iodine), USD0.52 (zinc – only 1 program), but was not calculated for iron.",0
Mean cost per person-year of “useful” coverage was estimated as USD8.53 (vitamin A) and USD0.74 (iodine) but not available for iron or zinc.,0
"Although Vitamin A capsules were less costly than iron per person (USD0.12/person/year compared to USD0.36), delivery costs for vitamin A were higher: USD1.83 compared to USD0.40.",0
"This may reflect lower coverage with volunteer health workers and lower population densities in Africa, where most costing studies of vitamin A were done.",0
The reported cost structures of delivery for these programs were however somewhat similar.,0
"The costs of providing weekly iron-folic acid in a program setting may also be useful for estimating costs of providing micronutrient powders for home fortification for children 6–36 months, and for therapeutic zinc for children under five.",0
Program cost data for these latter two interventions are almost non-existent.,0
"This study therefore fills a major gap in the cost literature, namely estimating the cost of implementing weekly iron supplementation programs.",0
"It has policy significance given the recommendation to expand coverage of supplementation with weekly iron and folic acid supplements to women of reproductive age, as well as for other similar supplementation programs, such as multiple micronutrient powders and zinc for children.",0
"Effects of ethnicity and vitamin D supplementation on vitamin D status and changes in bone mineral content in infants\n\nAbstract\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nTo evaluate the effects on serum 25(OH)D and bone mineralization of supplementation of breast-fed Hispanic and non-Hispanic Caucasian infants with vitamin D in infants in Houston, Texas.",0
"Conclusion\nLow cord 25(OH)D levels are seen in Hispanic infants, but their functional significance is uncertain related to bone health in a southern US setting.",0
Daily vitamin D intake of 400 IU during the first months of life appears adequate to increase serum 25(OH)D and support BMC increases despite low initial 25(OH)D levels in some infants.,0
The recommended dose of 400 IU (10 micrograms) daily for infants was established based on typical amounts in a teaspoon of cod liver oil [1].,0
This recommendation has recently been reaffirmed as being appropriate by both the Institute of Medicine [2] and the American Academy of Pediatrics [3] whereas the Endocrine Society considers the 400 IU to be a minimum appropriate dose [4].,0
"Although the dose of 400 IU daily is used for both breast-fed and formula-fed babies, vitamin D-deficient rickets is extremely rare in formula-fed infants primarily due to the mandatory addition of vitamin D to infant formulas in the United States.",0
Formula-fed infants typically consume 300-500 IU/day from their formula and therefore generally meet the current recommendations without an additional oral supplement of vitamin D drops especially after the first 6 to 8 weeks of life.,0
The relatively greater calcium and phosphorus concentration in US infant formulas compared to human milk may also be protective against rickets in some infants.,0
"Remarkably, few data have looked at modern techniques of assessing bone mineral status and compared it to vitamin D levels and supplementation in this population [5].",0
Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is accepted as the best marker of vitamin D status although it may serve primarily as a marker of exposure rather than clinical outcomes [2].There are few data that correlate serum 25(OH)D levels with functional outcomes in newborns and small infants.,0
"Neonatal serum 25(OH)D levels reflect a range of in utero factors, most significant of these being the maternal vitamin D status [6].",0
"Although calcium and phosphorus are transported transplacentally without vitamin D, the effects of low vitamin D in utero or shortly after birth are uncertain [7].",0
"This study was conducted to evaluate early life bone mineral content (BMC) and the effects of three months of vitamin D supplementation in breast-fed Hispanic and non-Hispanic Caucasian (henceforth, ""Caucasian"") infants on vitamin D levels.",0
We hypothesized that 25(OH)D would be lower in Hispanic than Caucasian newborns but that these differences would not be substantial enough to be related closely to BMC and bone mineral density (BMD) or their changes during the first three months of life.,0
"However, the relationship between vitamin D status and bone-related outcomes in supplemented infants provides information about the effects of these cord levels and vitamin D supplementation in early infancy.",0
"Furthermore, few data have evaluated Hispanic infants who may be at high-risk for low vitamin D status due to poor maternal vitamin D intake [4].",0
"Other lifestyle and dress habits were not evaluated, and all participants were observed by the study staff for typical Western-style US clothing (sleeveless or short-sleeved shirts in the summer, jackets or coats in the winter).",0
Differences markedly less than are less likely to be biologically relevant and this study was not designed to identify small differences.,0
Statistical analysis was not applied to the relative change in serum 25(OH)D values with low baseline versus high baseline data as there is currently no accepted optimal approach for such an evaluation as reviewed recently by Tu and Gilthorpe [8].,0
We evaluated the relationship between cord blood 25(OH)D and BMC and BMD at one week of age.,0
"BMC was highly correlated to body weight (r = 0.86, p < 0.001) as was BMD (r = 0.56, p < 0.001).",0
"BMC was significantly related to length at one week (r = 0.61, p < 0.001) however, in multivariate analysis including weight and length, only weight was significant, p < 0.001 and length was not significant, p = 0.87.",0
"Length was similar between Hispanic and Caucasians, 50.3 ± 2.1 cm versus 50.5 ± 2.0 cm respectively, p = 0.72.",0
"Prenatal vitamin supplement composition varied by brand; however, most brands included 200 IU vitamin D per pill.",0
There was no relationship between compliance and outcome so this was not further considered in the analysis.,0
Of note is that the BMC and BMD were greater in Hispanic infants at three months but not at one week of age.,0
"When body weight at three months was included as a covariate in this analysis, changes in BMC remained significant, p = 0.03, but changes in BMD were not (p = 0.06).",0
"We found that cord 25(OH)D (dependent variable) was not significantly related to BMC and BMD as shown before, and was not closely related to BMC at three months (p = 0.10).",0
"Discussion\nWe found 25(OH)D levels < 20 ng/mL to be common in the cord blood of infants in a southern climate in the United States representing about 60% of the infants in our study, with about 20% of the infants having values ≤ 10 ng/mL.",0
"However, we did not identify any specific physiological consequences of these cord 25(OH)D levels for bone mineralization at birth as evidenced by initial DXA measurements.",0
Supplementation with 400 IU/day of vitamin D to these infants led to a relatively greater increase in those who were born with the lowest vitamin D status and there was no suggestion of any bone mineral outcome deficits at one week or three months of age in infants with low cord 25(OH)D levels.,0
"We note that our study was of limited size however, and that larger studies are needed in diverse global populations.",0
Our study did not have the ability to identify the effects of small amounts of formula or other nutritional differences between groups.,0
The close relationships between weight and length and initial BMC imply that calcium transfer across the placenta is closely related to overall nutrient transfer and not to vitamin D status (7).,0
"Of note is that few subjects had a cord 25(OH)D < 6 ng/mL, a value found in studies in pregnant women and newborns in the Middle East [9,10].",0
"Neonatal rickets and hypocalcemia have been reported in some, but not all infants with cord or maternal 25(OH)D values < 6-10 ng/mL from the Middle East.",0
"These extremely low values are not commonly reported in the United States, although we speculate that an increasing number of cases may be reported in the future due to increased awareness of vitamin D deficiency.",0
There are very few data on 25(OH)D in cord blood in the Hispanic population and no data looking specifically at the relative increase over time based on cord 25(OH)D [11].,0
We did not have PTH values on the cord blood but PTH values at three months of age were not correlated significantly with 25(OH)D values at birth or three months or with bone mineral outcomes.,0
Differences in 25(OH)D between Hispanic and Caucasian infants may be related to lifestyle including sunshine exposure.,0
These were not evaluated in this study but there are no clear cultural reasons to expect a substantial difference in Houston.,0
"Of note is that in that study, about 10% of infants with these very low 25(OH)D levels had evidence of hypocalcemia although none had physical symptoms and it is not clear if there was a true cause and effect in this group.",0
"Although there was a trend in that study towards a relative increase in 25(OH)D in infants with lower baseline values who received supplementation, this was not clearly demonstrated.",0
"In the United States, median values for 25(OH)D in a northern setting in the first days of life were 17 ng/mL with 58% of infants < 20 ng/mL, results very similar to those seen in our study [13].",0
We found similar ionized calcium levels in Hispanic and Caucasians at birth.,0
"There is some suggestion that late hypocalcemic tetany is more common in Hispanic infants, although this is not well demonstrated due to the limited published data [14].",0
"Regardless, serum calcium in the cord blood and in the first days of life is likely controlled by a variety of factors, of which vitamin D is only one factor.",0
Limited previous research is generally consistent with our findings.,0
Park et al [15] studied Korean infants at 2 to 5 months of age and found no relationship between 25(OH)D level and BMC assessed by DXA even though many of the infants had very low 25(OH)D levels.,0
They speculated that this is due primarily to passive absorption of calcium at this age.,0
It has been suggested but is not proven that early life calcium absorption is primarily non-vitamin D dependent [2].,0
"However, it is likely that by three months of age, vitamin D has a key role in calcium absorption, especially in breast-fed infants with a relatively low calcium intake compared to formula-fed infants.",0
Whether the greater bioavailability of calcium from human milk compared to formula affects the needed level of 25(OH)D by infants is unknown.,0
Greer et al [16] found an increase in 25(OH)D from 24 to 39 ng/mL at three months of age with the provision of 400 IU/day of vitamin D to breast-fed infants.,0
"These results are similar to ours, with slightly higher 25(OH)D values found in the Greer study.",0
Direct comparisons however of 25(OH)D values between studies conducted in the past and recent studies should be done with caution due to well-documented variations in assay techniques.,0
"Therefore, in considering early vitamin D supplementation, the question becomes whether there is physiological benefit to rapid replenishment with vitamin D (e.g.",0
high doses of vitamin D in early life) with or without monitoring of 25(OH)D levels or whether the 400 IU/day dose is adequate.,0
"Our data, from this small dataset, can only be used to partially answer this question specifically related to bone health.",0
"However, it appears that, at least in a southern US setting, 400 IU/day is adequate for infants regardless of vitamin D status at birth.",0
"We cannot rule out the possibility that a small number of infants will be hypocalcemic in the first weeks of life with this approach, but, this appears to be uncommon and may be more related to PTH function than vitamin D. Further research is needed relative to the etiology of symptomatic hypocalcemia in the first weeks of life.",0
Studies in adults have found a greater increase in 25(OH)D levels in subjects who started at a lower level before supplementation [17].,0
Similar data are not readily available in pediatric populations.,0
Caution should be used in interpreting any results for changes in 25(OH)D based on baseline levels.,0
It has been suggested that these results may reflect a regression to the mean phenomenon or may be related in part to measurement variability (8).,0
"However, the findings in our study appear meaningful in that the provision of vitamin D at a dose of 400 IU/day led to mean values that were above 30 ng/mL regardless of starting value or ethnicity.",0
The 30 ng/mL target is well above that likely to be needed for adequate vitamin D status in the newborn based upon the recent recommendations of the Institute of Medicine [2].,0
The effects of maternal vitamin D deficiency are complex and may extend beyond bone health effects in infants.,0
Provision of all pregnant and lactating women with the Recommended Daily Allowance of 600 IU/day is an important public health strategy.,0
"Nonetheless, such supplements are not universally consumed by the population.",0
"The Hispanic community may be at higher risk due to darker skin pigmentation, greater obesity, lower dairy intake and less supplement use.",0
It has been suggested that all Hispanics and all pregnant and lactating women have their 25(OH)D levels monitored [4].,0
Of note is that 25(OH)D levels in a southern United States climate are low despite sunshine exposure year round at the latitude in Houston.,0
"Furthermore, there is a seasonal dependence of 25(OH)D levels although we did not have enough subjects to identify the degree to which this seasonal dependence was affected by ethnicity.",0
We had previously shown a seasonal dependence of 25(OH)D levels in prepubertal girls in Houston [18] with no differences in calcium absorption or kinetics between Hispanic and Caucasian prepubertal girls.,0
"Thus, it is clear that a southern US location is not protective against seasonal deficiency of vitamin D or low cord 25(OH)D levels.",0
"Conclusion\nWe found that low 25(OH)D levels are common in newborns in a southern US climate, especially among Hispanic infants.",0
Our findings support current guidelines to begin vitamin D supplementation of 400 IU/day to all breast-fed infants in the first week of life and to further encourage the provision of adequate vitamin D to pregnant women.,0
Larger studies are needed in diverse populations at various latitudes to further characterize the relationship between vitamin D supplementation and bone mineral content.,0
Maternal Vitamin D Deficiency Delays Glomerular Maturity in F1 and F2 Offspring\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nThere is a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in women of reproductive age.,0
"However, at all ages, both F1 and F2 VitD- mice had shorter glomerular diameters, and diet played a significant role in the total variation.",0
"Immature glomeruli begin to disappear at 10 days, but at this age, F1-VitD- mice had more immature and mature glomeruli than F1-SC mice.",0
"At 6 months of age, F1-VitD- mice exhibited more glomeruli, while F2-VitD- mice exhibited the same number of glomeruli as F2-SC mice, but fewer glomeruli compared to the F1-VitD group.",0
Both diet and generation account for the total variation in the number of glomeruli.,0
Decreases in urine output and podocin expression and increases in urea and creatinine in the urine were observed in F1 offspring.,0
Conclusion\nThese findings demonstrate that maternal vitamin D deficiency accompanies changes in the renal expression of important factors that may retard the maturation of glomeruli by extending the period of nephrogenesis.,0
This insufficiency is likely related to diet[3]and is gaining recognition as a public health problem.,0
"[""The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency is high even in sunny climates, such as Brazil's, principally in adolescents[4].""]",0
"Vitamin D is critical for the development of the nervous system[5],[6]and immunological functions[7]during fetal development.",0
Vitamin D during the pregnancy is important to both maternal skeletal preservation and fetal skeletal formation.,0
"However, new evidence suggests that vitamin D could be vital to normal fetal development and that vitamin D restriction in this period may affect chronic disease susceptibility post-natal life[8].",0
"Furthermore, recent studies have shown that this restriction can generate “genomic imprinting” in the fetus, which is related to the genesis of chronic diseases in adulthood[9].",0
"Moreover, vitamin D is associated with premature births, obesity and renal dysfunction in adulthood, making it more than an essential fat-soluble vitamin responsible for calcium metabolism[9],[10].",0
"Normal development of the kidney is a highly complex process that requires precise cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis[11].",0
"[""Among the essential regulators of kidney development are components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), podocin (a critical component of the glomerular slit diaphragm) and the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene WT1[12].""]",0
"Vitamin D restriction during pregnancy and throughout lactation in rats is associated with an increased number of glomeruli and decreased renal corpuscle size among offspring, although the causes and consequences of this abnormal kidney phenotype remain unknown[13].",0
"Therefore, the adverse effects of vitamin D restriction during kidney development need further exploration.",0
This study investigates the effects of maternal vitamin D deficiency on glomerular development in early postnatal life and its effects on renal structure at maturity.,0
This study focuses on the F1 and F2 generations after F0 maternal vitamin D restriction.,0
"Diet significantly affected KM ( P \u200a=\u200a0.006), but there was no interaction between diet and generation ( P>0.05; two-way ANOVA).",0
"Both diet ( P<0.0001) and generation ( P \u200a=\u200a0.003) affected the GD, but there was no interaction between diet and generation ( P>0.05; two-way ANOVA).",0
"At 10 days of age, generation contributed significantly to KM ( P<0.0001), but there was no interaction between diet and generation ( P>0.05; two-way ANOVA).",0
"Diet affected the GD in 10-day-old offspring ( P<0.0001), but there was no interaction between diet and generation ( P>0.05; two-way ANOVA).",0
"Immature glomeruli normally begin to disappear at this age, but the F1-VitD- mice had 150% more immature glomeruli and 25% more mature glomeruli than the F1-SC mice ( P<0.0001).",0
"Diet significantly affected the GD at 6 months of age ( P \u200a=\u200a0.0008), but there was no interaction between diet and generation ( P>0.05; two-way ANOVA).",0
"Both diet ( P \u200a=\u200a0.001) and generation ( P \u200a=\u200a0.04) affected the number of glomeruli at 6 months of age, but there was no interaction between diet and generation ( P>0.05; two-way ANOVA).",0
"However, the 24 h urine output, adjusted for BM, was significant lower (−60%; P \u200a=\u200a0.004) in the F1-VitD- mice than the F1-SC mice, even without differences in water intake between these groups.",0
"However, at 6 month of age, in both the F1 and F2 generations, the VitD- mice had significantly higher values of renin expression than the SC mice ( P \u200a=\u200a0.001).",0
"AT1r expression was significantly higher at 6 months of age than at weaning only in F1-VitD- offspring ( P \u200a=\u200a0.0007,Fig.",0
"Therefore, podocin expression was significantly different between the F1 and F2 generations among VitD- offspring at weaning ( P \u200a=\u200a0.02) and at 6 months of age ( P \u200a=\u200a0.004).",0
"Discussion\nMicronutrient deficiency during development, such as maternal vitamin D deficiency, is a subject of increasing importance because of the nutritional deficiencies caused by excessive consumption of junk food during pregnancy.",0
"However, vitamin D insufficiency is still under-recognized and under-treated, despite its prevalence.",0
A recent study of pregnant women in Europe reported that only 12% had an optimal level of vitamin D[20].,0
"In the present study, maternal vitamin D deficiency in mice led to significant changes in kidney development in the offspring, such as retardation of glomerular maturation and an increase in the number of glomeruli.",0
"Furthermore, not only the F1 generation but also the F2 generation was affected by the gestational vitamin D deficiency of the F0 generation mice.",0
"Vitamin D is normally stored in the liver and adipose tissue, and after six weeks on a restricted diet, the vitamin D levels were extremely reduced without alteration of calcium or phosphate levels in the rodents[21].",0
"Previous studies in rodents have shown that the restriction of vitamin D for a period of six weeks prior to mating assures vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy[13],[22].",0
"Vitamin D deficiency during the third trimester of pregnancy in humans has been associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity in offspring[23], which could be linked to the potential role of vitamin D in the regulation of adiposity[24],[25].",0
"Maternal nutrient restriction causes adiposity in offspring[26], and recent data suggest that maternal vitamin D deficiency affects adiposity, although the mechanisms are not yet fully understood[23].",0
"In the present study, adiposity was not the focus.",0
"However, there was a significant increase in BM in both generations of VitD- offspring at six months of age, but the BM was higher only in the F2-VitD- group at weaning.",0
"However, at three months of age, the VitD- groups in both the F1 and F2 generations showed a tendency toward increased BM, although the difference was not statistically significant.",0
The small sample size of the groups could explain these results.,0
"In rats, it has been observed that maternal vitamin D deficiency leads to a significant increase in the number of glomeruli, which is a unique and important effect of vitamin D restriction during fetal development[13].",0
"To understand this result, it should be emphasized that nephrogenesis in rodents, unlike in humans, continues after delivery for the first 10 days of postnatal life.",0
This period is roughly comparable to the third gestational trimester of humans[27].,0
"Experimental models have demonstrated that blocking the RAS during development causes changes in the glomerular vasculature that affects the normal maturity of the kidney, although the RAS cascade during kidney development is not fully understood[28],[29].",0
Research suggests that vitamin D is important for differentiation and maturation during cell proliferation[9]and that it down-regulates renin gene expression in the kidneys[13].,0
"However, in the present study, renin expression was significantly higher at six months of age in both the F1 and F2 generations, and AT1r expression was higher in F1-VitD- offspring than in F1-SC offspring.",0
Kidney organogenesis is begun and maintained as a result of a series of regulatory molecules.,0
"WT1 is expressed in the metanephric blastema and probably plays a key role in podocyte differentiation[12],[30].",0
"Although the VitD- offspring in the present study did not show a reduction in WT1 expression, maternal vitamin D deficiency did alter the ratio of immature-to-mature glomeruli at birth by extending the period of glomerular maturation.",0
"Maternal vitamin D deficiency may also have contributed to an increased number of glomeruli, thus producing smaller glomeruli than in animals fed SC.",0
"Indeed, the smaller glomeruli could explain the high BP observed among F1-VitD- offspring and the strong tendency toward high BP observed in the F2 generation.",0
"Previous research has documented a negative correlation between the number of glomeruli and BP levels in humans[31]and in rodents[27],[32].",0
This finding is consistent with the high renin and AT1r expressions observed in the present study.,0
Activation of the RAS may play a significant role in the development of mechanisms that lead to kidney damage[33].,0
Two hypotheses are currently proposed to explain the progression of chronic renal disease.,0
The results of the present study are consistent with the “overload hypothesis”.,0
"This hypothesis suggests that structural and functional adaptations are associated with glomerular hypertension, hyperfiltration, and hypertrophy partially compensated for nephron losses[34].",0
Podocin provides the structural organization of the slit diaphragm and the regulation of filtration function and seems to be involved in the alteration of the glomerular basement membrane[35].,0
"Nephrin is expressed late in the process of podocyte differentiation and is a locus for the formation of the slit diaphragm, foot process maintenance and physical integrity in vivo , but it is dispensable for cell survival and has little impact on gene regulation during glomerular development.",0
"In the present study, vitamin D restriction during nephrogenesis reduced podocin expression in the F1 generation from weaning until six months of age but not in the F2 generation.",0
Such effects should be evaluated because podocin serves in the structural organization of the slit diaphragm and the regulation of its filtration function[35].,0
"Although the mature animals did not show significant proteinuria, maternal vitamin D deficiency altered podocin expression in the F1 generation from weaning until six months of age, but not in the F2 generation.",0
The question of how developmental programming passes to subsequent generations deserves further attention.,0
"Intense maternal protein restriction, for example, leads to chronic diseases in adult life, affecting both the F1 and F2 generations[37],[38], and reaching even the F3 generation[39].",0
Part of the explanation seems to be decreased global methylation in these offspring[40].,0
The present study has certain limitations.,0
"The major aim of the study was to investigate glomerular development and renal structure at birth, 10 days and adulthood in mice born to mothers fed a diet restricted in vitamin D. Although, we examined other variables, such as body mass and 24 h urine, the present study was not designed to investigate renal functional and metabolic consequences but rather was designed to answer the question of whether there were structural, glomerular alterations or transgenerational effects.",0
Further studies are necessary to clarify the impact of maternal vitamin D restriction on the renal function of offspring.,0
"Furthermore, the literature shows some relationship between vitamin D deficiency and adipose tissue development, and other studies should evaluate such effects, and the transgenerational effects.",0
"In conclusion, the present findings provide insight into the relationship between maternal vitamin D deficiency and the occurrence of a greater number of glomeruli in offspring.",0
"Maternal vitamin D deficiency is accompanied by changes in the renal expression of podocin, renin and AT1 receptors, and it delays the maturity of the glomeruli, by extending nephrogenesis.",0
"These findings are more pronounced in F1 progeny, but F2 progeny are also affected.",0
The Efficacy and Safety of a High Dose of Vitamin D in Mothers with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial\n\nAbstract\nBackground: During pregnancy and lactation outstanding changes occur in mother’s vitamin D metabolism.,0
"This study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of 300,000 IU vitamin D given intramuscularly on body status in new cases of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).",0
"The median concentration of serum 25(OH)D3 in the IG was to 62.10 nmol/l after the intervention, showing an increase of around 158%, compared to before intervention (24.25 nmol/l) whereas the CG showed a decrease of around 4.5%.",0
"Conclusions: The single 300,000 IM dose of vitamin D is regarded as an effective and safe to promptly improve vitamin D status in GDM.",0
"These changes occur according to the needs for the mineralization of the fetus bones as well as adequate secretion of vitamin D in mother’s milk.1\nDue to rapid fetal development, particularly bone calcification at the terminal stages of pregnancy, there is a possibility of vitamin D deficiency to occur in mothers.",0
"Since, fetus and baby are both dependent upon mother for blood and milk respectively, mother’s vitamin D supplementation is highly vital.",0
"Studies have indicated that during pregnancy vitamin D deficiency varies from 18% to 84%, which varies with the region under the study and type of clothing.2,3Vitamin D deficiency among breast-fed children in the regions with heavy sunshine such as the Middle East is high.3-5This hypovitaminosis which is due to limited exposure to sun of mothers’ and their babies as well as low vitamin D intake by mothers.",0
These can cause vitamin D deficiency in mothers’ milk as the only source of vitamin D for babies.6\nThere are evidences showing the role of vitamin D in keeping normal glucose homeostasis.7-10Resistance to insulin and destruction of insulin secretion in human and animal models has considerably been related to vitamin D deficiency.,0
"Such a relation has been attributed to special receptors for vitamin D in pancreatic betacells.9Moreover, vitamin D was shown to have positive effects on insulin sensitivity, and its deficiency to have negative effects on the function of betacells.11In agreement with this, cohort studies revealed that vitamin D had a protective effect against diabetes type II.8,11Also, serum concentration of vitamin D during 24-29thweek of pregnancy in women suffering from gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was lower than that in women without the disease.12\nThe study of vitamin D status and improving it in the lactating mothers with previous GDM is of conspicuous value.4,13\nDue to the limited exposure to sunshine and inadequate intake, the level of vitamin D is reduced in the milk of lactating mothers.",0
"Therefore, vitamin D supplementation in high doses has been recommended, and oral doses of 20000 or 40000 IU were associated with positive outcomes.6,14Moreover, higher oral dose of (6400 IU per day) to lactating mothers significantly increased vitamin D status in mothers as well as the vitamin D content and antirachitic activity of their milk.14Therefore, high doses of vitamin D, either orally or through injection, has recently been recommended.15-24\nA single dose of vitamin D, administered parenterally, would be more effective, because it is not associated with the noncompliance associated with an oral dose.",0
"A dose of 600,000 IU vitamin D resulted in hypercalcemia, therefore, it can not be regarded a safe dose.17There is no study to evaluate vitamin D status in mothers with previous GDM, and present oral vitamin D products are not fully effective,16therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the effect of intramuscular injection of 300,000 IU during a three-month period.",0
"There was no difference between the serum concentration of PTH of the IG and CG prior to intervention, however, serum concentration of PTH after the intervention was significantly lower in the IG than that of CG.",0
"Caption (TABLE-WRAP): TABLE 3:\n\nThe number and (percentage) frequency distribution of vitamin D status in the intervention group (IG) and control group (CG) before and after interventionGroupsVitamin D status (nmol/l)IGCGBeforeAfterBeforeAfterSevere deficient (<12.5)0000Moderate deficient (12.5-24.9)15(62.5%)09(42.9%)10(47.6%)Mild deficient (25-34.9)4(16.7%)1(4.2%)7(33.3%)3(14.3%)Optimal (>35)5(20.8%)23(95.8%)4(19%)6(28.6%)\n\nDiscussion\nIf vitamin D deficiency is defined as serum concentration of 25(OH) vitamin D3 lower than 35 nmol/l,12about 80% of the mothers with GDM in the present study were suffering to some degrees from vitamin D deficiency.",0
"This indicates the efficacy of this procedure in dramatic improvement of vitamin D status in the mothers, especially in the region with high vitamin D deficiency.",0
"Considering the range of obtained serum calcium and phosphorus in mothers, no incidence of hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, or hypervitaminosis, this dosage and route of supplementation of vitamin D seems to be safe for mothers and their infants.",0
"In this study, the median concentration of the serum vitamin D in the IG raised from 24.25 to 62.10 nmol/l, which is in line with a recent survey carried out by Restorff et al.26on 33 rheumatoid arthritic patients.",0
"They showed that supplementation with an oral dose of 300,000 IU of vitamin D and 500-1000 mg daily of calcium led to an increase in the concentration of serum vitamin D from 15 to 81.4 nmol/l.",0
"Moreover, similar to that find by Restroff et al.26serum PTH of the IG decreased significantly by 22% in our study.",0
"The mechanism of PTH reduction is that an increased serum vitamin D leads to a decrease in PTH gene translation, and thus PTH secretion.",0
"On the other hand, increased serum calcium causes the intracellular calcium to attach to calcium receptors on the surface of parathyroid cells causing a change in a special form of the receptors.",0
"Such a change results in the inhibition of PTH secretion from parathyroid cells.27\nThe increase of serum calcium in the IG in the present study is similar to that reported in the other studies.15,17-20,22-25,27,28The mechanism of increasing serum calcium by vitamin D is that vitamin D attaches optionally to receptors X of retinoic acid (RXR), and composes a heteromeric complex with a certain sequence on the DNA, known as reacting elements to vitamin D. This leads to the transcription of a special mRNA, which results in the translation of several proteins such as epithelial calcium channels and the proteins attached to calcium.",0
"This results in the increase of calcium absorption from the intestine.27\nPrevious studies,17,27of intramuscular injection of 600,000 unit of vitamin D was associated with significant increases of serum vitamin D at 1.5, 3, and 6 months, but not significant at 9 and 12 months later.",0
"In these studies,17,27as well as ours, serum calcium level considerably increased, but contrary to ours, they reported abnormal calcium level in 7% to 12% of the patients during the study.",0
"In another study,15administration of 600,000 IU of vitamin D was associated with a significant increase in serum vitamin D, a significant decrease in serum PTH, and hypercalcemia occurring in 4% of the subjects during 4 and 12 months of intervention.",0
"In our study, no hypocalcaemia was observed indicating the safety and efficiency of this supplementation method.",0
"A recent study,21has indicated that administrating a high dose of vitamin D every two months was an easy and comfortable treatment.",0
The study was evaluated as more economic and effective in terms of patients’ compliance.,0
"Our study revealed that a single high dose injection of vitamin D is more economic and effective particularly in lactating mothers who refrain from consuming oral daily doses due to postpartum care, unwillingness or depression.",0
"Witham et al.24showed that single doses of 100,000 and 200,000 IU of vitamin D in diabetic type II patients increased serum vitamin D from 41 to 63 and from 48 to79 nmol./l respectively.",0
"However, they showed that the decrease of PTH did not reach statistical significance.",0
"Moreover, another study,18showed that a single dose of 200,000 IU of vitamin D in the healthy youths was associated with a peak in vitamin D concentration after two weeks of treatment, but lower than that of our study at three months after treatment.",0
"Therefore, a single dose of 300,000 IU dose employed in this study is of higher effectiveness compared with an oral dose, especially in people suffering from vitamin D deficiency.",0
"However, our study is limited for not measuring urine calcium and creatinin, since these variables could confirm the presence of hypervitaminosis more exactly and more confidently.",0
"Moreover, serum vitamin D was measured by ELISA kit, which is of lower accuracy compared with HPLC and RIA methods.",0
"Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of postpartum supplementation of vitamin D on antirachitic factor of the mother’s milk, and infant’s health indexes.",0
"Moreover, additional clinical trial studies will have to be conducted to determine the effect of mega doses of vitamin D on other health-related parameters such as the factors related to metabolic syndrome as well as inflammatory markers.",0
"Conclusion\nThe findings of the study indicate that intramuscular administration of a single dose of 300,000 IU of vitamin D is effective and safe to improve vitamin D status, and to ameliorate the factors related to the health of mothers and infants, particularly in the regions with severe vitamin D deficiency.",0
Vitamin D in pregnancy: A metabolic outlook\n\nAbstract\nVitamin D deficiency is a preventable health problem.,0
"Research indicates that adequate vitamin D intake in pregnancy is optimal for maternal, fetal and child health.",0
"Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is the origin for a host of future perils for the child, especially effect on neurodevelopment and immune system.",0
Some of this damage done by maternal Vitamin D deficiency gets evident after many years.,0
"Therefore, prevention of vitamin D deficiency among pregnant women is essential.",0
"The currently recommended supplementation amount of vitamin D is not sufficient to maintain a value of 25 hydroxy vitamin D above 30 ng/ml, during pregnancy.",0
Studies are underway to establish the recommended daily doses of vitamin D in pregnant women.,0
"Clearly, further investigation is required into the effects of vitamin D, of vitamin D supplementation, and of vitamin D analogs for improvement in human health generally and mothers and children specifically.",0
"This review discusses vitamin D metabolism, dietary requirements and recommendations and implications of vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy and lactation.",0
INTRODUCTION\nVitamin D has been a hot topic in the medical world for the past 10 years.,0
Concerns about vitamin D have resurfaced in medical and scientific literature owing to its multiple effects on human health.,0
We are beginning to learn that it plays a much wider role in health and disease prevention.,0
"The classical and non-classical pathways of this hormone affect calcium metabolism, the immune system, cell proliferation and differentiation, infection, and cancer.",0
"[1] The question scientists have been working on for almost a decade is why and how vitamin D is affecting conception, pregnancy and the health of the newborn.",0
"[2] Also the media has been taking increasing interest, and public expectations have been raised regarding the enhanced roles for vitamin D in pregnancy.",0
"It is an unrecognized epidemic common among children, adults and pregnant women throughout the world, across ethnicity and season.",0
"[2] There are increasing studies worldwide reporting poor vitamin D status, including those in tropical countries.",0
The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency has been reported to range from 15% to 80%.,0
[34] It is now recognized that everyone is at risk for vitamin D deficiency.,0
Modern day cosmetology and our urbanization has eclipsed the sunlight and it is impossible is to fulfill daily intake via diet as a large amount of vitamin D needs to be consumed.,0
"Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in India, a finding that is unexpected in a tropical country with abundant sunshine.",0
There are few data from India about the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in pregnancy and in the newborn.,0
[5] The increasing prevalence of disorders linked to vitamin D deficiency is reflected in the several hundred children with rickets treated each year.,0
[6] Low dietary calcium intake and 25(OH) D concentrations were associated with deleterious effects on bone mineral homeostasis.,0
"In the last 3 years, an increasing amount of research suggests that some of the damage done by Vitamin D deficiency is done in-utero, while the fetus is developing.",0
"Much of that damage may be permanent, that is, it cannot be fully reversed by taking Vitamin D after birth.",0
VITAMIND METABOLISM\nVitamin D is a misnomer.,0
"Because of its steroid structure and function, vitamin D plays an important role in priming cells for other hormones to do their action.",0
"[7]\nVitamin D itself is devoid of any biological activity, but enzymatic conversion to 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH) 2D] generates the hormonal form with diverse biological activities.",0
"[8] The active form of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 1,25[OH] 2D3) has well-established effects on bone metabolism and mineral homeostasis.",0
"However, recently it has become clear that 1,25(OH) 2D3 has potent anti-proliferative and immunomodulatory actions that are not immediately linked to its role as a skeletal regulator.",0
"Approximately 25-30 g of calcium are transferred to the fetal skeleton by the end of pregnancy, most of which is transferred during the last trimester.",0
"The requirement for vitamin D in maintaining normal calcium metabolism throughout pregnancy and lactation in mothers, fetuses and newborn infants is still controversial.",0
"It is clear, however, that vitamin D requirements are increased in mothers during pregnancy and lactation.",0
"[10] The synthesis, metabolism and function of vitamin D compounds during pregnancy are complex.",0
"Data suggest that 1,25(OH) 2D aids implantation and maintains normal pregnancy, supports fetal growth through delivery of calcium, controls secretion of multiple placental hormones, and limits production of proinflammatory cytokines.",0
"Notably, the 24,25(OH) 2D synthesized by the placenta accumulates in bone and may be involved in ossification of the fetal skeleton.",0
"Although transplacental transport has not been studied in humans, vitamin D passage from the mother to the fetus would be facilitated by serum concentrations of 1,25(OH) 2D being higher in the maternal compared to the fetal circulations.",0
[12] Vitamin D deficiency can result in lower bone mineral density and an increased risk of bone loss (osteoporosis) or bone fracture because a lack of vitamin D alters mineral metabolism in the body.,0
"[""Sources of vitamin D\nThe most important source of vitamin D is the skin's synthesis of the vitamin from sunlight.""]",0
"[13] Use of sun blocks, increased coverage of clothing and time spent indoors increase the risk of Vitamin D deficiency.",0
"It has been estimated that exposure to sunlight for usually no more than 5-15 min/d between 10 AM and 3 PM, in the spring, summer, and fall at latitudes above and below 35° (and all year near the equator) to exposed parts of the body involving “arms, legs and face “provides the body with its required 1000 IU of cholecalciferol.",0
Sunshine in not adequate in many parts of world.,0
"In the United States staple foods like milk, breakfast cereals and margarines are artificially fortified with vitamin D.[14] At present, the number and variety of vitamin D fortified foods available on the market differs significantly between countries and is attributed to the country-specific policies on food fortification which are not yet unified.",0
"Vitamin D is present in a small number of foods, although, for an average person food will only supply about 10% of the amount needed.",0
"[""Although liver and cod liver oil contain vitamin D, they are not recommended in pregnancy as they also contain too much vitamin A.\nVitamin D is a unique nutrient because its requirement can be met by both endogenous production from sunlight as well as exogenous dietary sources, which complicates determining the body's daily nutritional requirements.""]",0
"Methods are currently available to quantify the contribution of endogenous vitamin D synthesis resulting from sun exposure, but serious limitations remain in accurately estimating dietary vitamin D intake because of the incompleteness of nutrient databases for both vitamin D-fortified food and vitamin D supplements.",0
"[""Thus, increasing vitamin D intake from vitamin D fortified foods, and vitamin D supplements, in combination with sensible sun exposure, maximize a person's vitamin D status to promote good health.""]",0
Women with darker skin Fitzpatrick Class 6 are more prone to Vitamin D deficiency as they need four to ten times sunlight than Fitzpatrick Class 1-4 skinned people for adequate Vitamin D synthesis.,0
"[15] Thus, Daily vitamin requirement varies with ethnicity, and this is relevant in case of Indian population.",0
Obesity is a growing epidemic.,0
"Pre-pregnancy obesity is also associated with significant increases in the odds of maternal and neonatal vitamin D deficiency, independent of other factors such as ethnicity.",0
"[16] This deficiency is because body fat stores much of the vitamin D made in the skin, making it less available to the body.",0
"[""Women who have intestinal malabsorption diseases like celiac disease and Crohn's disease or partial removal or bypass of the stomach or intestines absorb less of both dietary and supplemental vitamin D are at increased risk of deficiency.""]",0
"Overdose\nHypervitaminosis D is a serious, albeit very rare, condition.",0
"There is controversy concerning levels of nutrient intake, and at times the concept that “more is better” emerges.",0
It is said that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations above 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) are “not consistently associated with increased benefit”.,0
"For vitamin D, there are still underlying questions: How much is the daily requirement and How much is too much?",0
"[17] New research suggests that women who take high doses of vitamin D during pregnancy have a greatly reduced risk of complications, including gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and infection.",0
[18] This recommendation may be controversial because very high doses of vitamin D have long been believed to cause birth defects.,0
W\nEpidemiological analyses implicated high dietary vitamin D intake during pregnancy results in birth of syndromic babies.,0
Friedman and colleagues developed a model for this disorder in rabbits by administering near-fatal amounts of ergocalciferol during pregnancy.,0
"[20] Based on these accumulated observations, the uncertain teratogenic potential of high doses of calciferol analogs or of the associated disturbances in mineral homeostasis continues to cause concern.",0
Various human studies are done so far involving pharmacological doses of vitamin D during pregnancy.,0
"reported that as hypoparathyroid patients have completed many pregnancies while receiving ergocalciferol,[21] it is unlikely that material vitamin D, 25(OH) D, or 24,25(OH) 2D per se are teratogens.",0
"Most prenatal vitamins have around 400 IU of vitamin D, and most health groups recommend taking no more than 2,000 IU of the vitamin in supplement form daily.",0
"Eventually, as circulating 25(OH) D increases to toxic concentrations, the classic situation of hypercalciuria, hypercalcemia, and, finally, extraskeletal calcification becomes evident.",0
"[1819] To attain circulating 25(OH) D concentrations that exceed 250 nmol/L (100 ng/mL), a daily vitamin D intake well in excess of 10,000 IU/d (250 μg/d) for several months would be required.",0
"However, hypervitaminosis D has never occurred when physiologic amounts of vitamin D are ingested.",0
"In addition, no case of hypervitaminosis D from sun exposure has ever been reported.",0
"This is supported by the recent finding from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examining the effects of a single annual megadose of vitamin D3 (500,000 IU, equivalent to approximately 1370 IU/d) on fall and fracture outcomes in community-dwelling elderly women with a history of fall or fracture.",0
"Role of vitamin D in pregnant women\nAdequate vitamin D intake is essential for maternal and fetal health during pregnancy, and prevention of adverse outcomes.",0
Recent work emphasizes the importance of non-classical roles of vitamin D in pregnancy and the placenta.,0
"Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is associated with the non-classical actions of this hormone, being linked with preeclampsia, insulin resistance, gestational diabetes mellitus,[22] bacterial vaginosis, and an increased risk for caesarean section delivery.",0
Women who have vitamin D deficiency do not usually feel any different but in some may have muscle weakness and weakened bones.,0
A new study finds that women who develop severe preeclampsia tend to have lower blood levels of vitamin D than healthy pregnant women raising the possibility that the vitamin plays a role in the complication.,0
"Vitamin D supplementation reduces preeclampsia risk, compared to unsupplemented controls.",0
"[23] Preeclampsia is associated with low circulating levels of IGF-I and 1,25(OH) 2D and, in vitro , IGF-1 increases 1,25(OH) 2D production by primary human syncytiotrophoblasts from placentas from normal pregnancies but not from preeclamptic pregnancies.",0
"Studies by other groups have reported abnormal expression of 1α-hydroxylase, a vitamin D—activating enzyme in preeclamptic pregnancies, revealing a potential role for 1,25(OH) 2D3 as a regulator of placentation.",0
Induction of the 1α-hydroxylase in early gestation might provide a mechanism by which environmental or dietary vitamin D can influence fetal-placental development.,0
"Two clinical trials support a potential role of vitamin D in the prevention of preeclampsia, although neither of these treated with vitamin D supplements alone.",0
[24] Vitamin D supplementation in early pregnancy should be explored for preventing preeclampsia and promoting neonatal well-being.,0
Vitamin D is known to influence insulin secretion.,0
"1,25(OH) 2D regulates insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells and thereby affects circulating glucose levels.",0
"[25] As expected, low concentration of 25(OH) D is a risk factor for insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and features of metabolic syndrome in normoglycemic subjects.",0
Vitamin D deficiency during early pregnancy significantly increases the risk for gestational diabetes in later pregnancy.,0
[26]\nVitamin D may influence the course of infectious diseases during pregnancy.,0
Low 25(OH) D levels are correlated with increased bacterial vaginosis in the first trimester.,0
"Bacterial vaginosis is more prevalent in black women, who typically have lower serum 25(OH) D concentrations and have a six-fold higher chance of vitamin D deficiency, compared with white women.",0
"Vitamin D has effects on the immune system, cytokines, and antibacterial peptides that are likely to regulate the bacterial flora.",0
Nutritional vitamin D status has very recently been linked to the human innate immune system and its ability to contain Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,0
"Serum 25(OH) D levels are inversely related to primary cesarean section in nulliparous women, an unexpected and unexplained maternal outcome recently identified.",0
The risk was four-fold higher in women with serum 25(OH) D levels below 37.5 nmol/L (15ng/mL) controlling for multiple confounding factors.,0
"VDR and 1,25(OH) 2D normally increase skeletal muscle function.",0
"Conversely, vitamin D deficiency results in proximal muscle weakness and decreased lower extremity muscle function perhaps contributing to the risk for cesarean section.",0
The Cochrane review concluded that there is not enough evidence to evaluate the requirements and effects of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy.,0
"Data from three trials involving 463 women show a trend for women who receive vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy to more frequently have a baby with a birth weight below 2500 grams than those women receiving no treatment or placebo, although the statistical significance was borderline.",0
"Animal models of vitamin D deficiency have shown just how important adequate nutritional intakes of vitamin D are to skeletal, cardiovascular, and neurologic development in experimental animals.",0
"[27] Weishaar and Simpson[28] showed that lengthy periods of vitamin D deficiency in rats are associated with profound changes in cardiovascular function, including increases in cardiac and vascular muscle contractile function.",0
A recent study provides evidence with reference to the consequences of vitamin D deficiency on the neurodevelopment of the fetus during pregnancy in a rat model.,0
"[28] A study on rodents showed that hypovitaminosis D trabecular bone loss, and concluded that vitamin D is indispensable for normal bone mineralization during the reproductive period in rats.",0
[29]\nVitamin D appears to have a protective effect against multiple sclerosis (MS).,0
"Research has found direct connections between vitamin D and the genes known to be involved in MS, but exact pathology and whether vitamin D supplements during pregnancy or childhood can lessen the likelihood of the child developing MS later in life is not known.",0
"While there is interest in the role of vitamin D in the prevention of multiple sclerosis, following epidemiological studies demonstrating an association between vitamin D supplementation and reduced prevalence of the disease, future research, including randomized controlled trials in pregnant or nonpregnant individuals, is awaited to confirm or refute such benefit.",0
"Because the poor vitamin D stores of the mother may impair vitamin D state in the infant, it is important to know whether rickets can be prevented in breast fed infants by supplementation of the mother.",0
[30] The Canadian Pediatric Society recommended 2000 IU of vitamin D3 for pregnant and lactating mothers with periodic blood tests to check levels of 25(OH) D and calcium.,0
[31] The American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations focus on supplementing the infant and make no specific recommendations about universally supplementing breastfeeding mothers.,0
A sufficient supply of vitamin D to the breast fed infant is achieved only by increasing the maternal supplementation up to 2000 IU/day.,0
As such a dose is far higher than the daily dietary allowance recommended for lactating mothers its safety over prolonged periods is not known and should be examined.,0
Other suggests vitamin D supplementation of 400 IU/day to breast fed infants is the most secure way of preventing rickets in infants.,0
[32]\n\nRole of vitamin D in newborn and infant\nAdequate maternal vitamin D levels are also important for fetal and child health.,0
"Fetal Vitamin D concentrations are mainly dependent on maternal concentration, and maternal deficiency may lead to adverse outcomes in offspring.",0
"Vitamin D-deficiency in mothers have significantly increased risk of infantile rickets due to inadequate maternal–fetal transfer of 25-hydroxyvitamin D.[32] Recent retrospective studies found a significant and previously undetected association of maternal vitamin D deficiency with rickets-associated infant heart failure and with acute lower respiratory tract infection,[33] a serious complication often associated with sepsis without clinical signs of rickets.",0
While vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy has previously been associated with reduced risk of wheezing and type 1 diabetes.,0
[34] A few studies have observed that maternal Vitamin D concentrations are related to offspring birth weight and growth during the postnatal years.,0
Lower maternal vitamin D status was associated with lower bone mineral concentration and impaired glucose homeostasis in newborn infants.,0
"[35] Maternal vitamin D deficiency also has been associated with craniotabes,[35] a softening of skull bones that is one of the earliest signs of vitamin D deficiency, in a case study with neonatal seizures of a hypocalcemic infant and with impaired skeletal development in utero.",0
"[34] Interestingly, vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is also associated with risks of health problems later in childhood, including improper bone development at 9 yrs of age, asthma,[36] dental cavities, schizophrenia, and type I diabetes.",0
[37–39]\nThe concept that maternal nutritional status influences the risk of chronic disorders in the offspring has attracted interest over the past 2 decades.,0
"However, very few studies have been in position to examine this association directly in animals.",0
"Women of Indian origin, especially pregnant women, are known to have a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.",0
In Indian women calcium intakes are low and the demands on calcium economy are high because of repeated cycles of pregnancy and lactation.,0
Although there was no association between maternal Vitamin D status and offspring birth size.,0
"At present, vitamin D supplementation is not a part of antenatal care programs in India.",0
"Testing and treatment for vitamin D deficiency\nWomen of reproductive age are assumed to be able to obtain the recommended intake for almost all vitamins without the use of supplements, and no national organization recommends routine vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy unless a woman is at nutritional risk.",0
One approach is to consider serum testing in patients at high risk for vitamin D deficiency but treating without testing those at lower risk.,0
"The basis for these recommendations was made before it was possible to measure the circulating concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH) D], the indicator of nutritional vitamin D status.",0
"[4142] Endocrine Society Issues Practice Guideline on Vitamin D and the guideline recommend that clinicians screen for vitamin D deficiency in people at risk for deficiency, including obese individuals, blacks, pregnant and lactating women, and patients with malabsorption syndromes.",0
"[43] If electing to test vitamin D status, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the accepted biomarker to be offered early in pregnancy.",0
"[44] Although 1,25(OH) 2D is the active circulating form of vitamin D, measuring this level is not helpful because it is quickly and tightly regulated by the kidney.",0
"True deficiency would be evident only by measuring 25(OH) D. Of note, questions have been raised regarding the need for standardization of assays.",0
A large laboratory (Quest Diagnostics) recently reported the possibility of thousands of incorrect vitamin D level results.,0
Sunlight expo-sure questionnaires are imprecise and are not currently recommended.,0
"There is no consensus about the optimal 25(OH) D level, but many experts accept a range 75nmol/L (≥30 ng/mL) as optimal.",0
"[44] Controversy exists regarding the optimum concentration of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D for defining vitamin D deficiency, especially in pregnancy.",0
Most experts agree that serum vitamin D levels below 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) represent deficiency.,0
However this current practice is based on the skeletal actions of the vitamin and may not be applicable for its non-classic actions.,0
"As was recently pointed out in a Cochrane review, the topic of maternal vitamin D requirements during pregnancy has been poorly studied.",0
The reality is that the actual vitamin D requirement during pregnancy is not known.,0
"For that matter, the requirement for the general population is not known either.",0
"There is no dietary recommended intake (DRI) for vitamin D. What is known today is that for a pregnant woman, the adequate intake for vitamin D is 200 IU per day.",0
"However this recommended level, which was largely arbitrarily set, seems to be less helpful to improve the nutritional vitamin D status of pregnant women.",0
"[""National Osteoporosis Foundation's (NOF) recommends 400-800IU vitamin D for pregnant women.""]",0
"A recent systematic review concluded that antenatal vitamin D supplementation is effective in improving the vitamin D status of Asian and white women, improves growth in the first year of life in South Asian babies and therefore may contribute to reducing the incidence of rickets in this latter group, without evidence of harm.",0
"[""Current NICE guidance states clearly that pregnant women are informed, at their first antenatal booking, of the importance of adequate vitamin D during pregnancy and after, to maintain their own and their baby's health.""]",0
These women are advised to take 10 micrograms per day in the form of a multivitamin supplement.,0
It is crucial to ensure that at-risk women are aware of this need.,0
"Those identified as at-risk include: Women from black and ethnic minorities who are socially-excluded, women with limited exposure to sunlight, especially those who are housebound and obese women with prepregnancy BMI > 30.",0
Current U.S. guidelines call for pregnant women to get 400-600 IU.,0
"However, research in recent years has been challenging those ideas on what is enough, and what is too much.",0
The U.S. guidelines are currently under review.,0
"For now, though, 600 IU in prenatal vitamins remains the recommended daily intake for pregnant women.",0
"However, getting 25(OH) D levels consistently above 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) may require at least 1500-2000 IU/day of vitamin D. If a mother is vitamin D deficient, breast milk is not a good source of vitamin D, so infants need to be given vitamin D supplementation until they are weaned.",0
Also women are encouraged to continue to take vitamin D supplements after pregnancy to help protect against health problems such as osteoporosis.,0
"It was recently shown that a maternal supplementation of 2100 IU vitamin D/day was needed, when administered during the period of lactation, in order to observe an increase in serum levels of 25(OH) D in the breast-fed infants comparable to that observed in children given 400 IU/day.",0
"CONCLUSION\nVitamin D has emerged as something of a wonder supplement, according to the claims of dozens of studies published in the past few years.",0
The current lack of evidence of benefit for women at lower risk of vitamin D deficiency points to the need for further research into vitamin D supplementation in pregnant women with clinical neonatal and infant end-points under scrutiny.,0
"There is a similar gap in the knowledge base for optimal dosing, as there is little empirical robust evidence to support 600 IU/day.",0
"Further research is required, particularly to establish the dose needed to supplement pregnant women with pre-existing deficiency and the optimal gestation at which vitamin D supplementation should be started.",0
"Recommendations should be made on informing women of the importance of maintaining adequate vitamin D stores in pregnancy, particularly for those at greatest risk of vitamin D deficiency.",0
"[""Sensible sun exposure and education of the public about the beneficial effects of some limited sun exposure to satisfy their body's vitamin D requirements should be implemented.""]",0
"Future studies are essential to determine the true vitamin D requirement during pregnancy not only for maternal skeletal preservation and fetal skeletal formation, but also for fetal “imprinting"" that may affect neurodevelopment, immune function and chronic disease susceptibility soon after birth as well as later in life.",0
"The few available studies investigating the reproductive safety of SGAs did not reach conclusive results, and none have compared monotherapy with polytherapy involving other psychotropic medications.",0
"The exposed neonates were more likely to be born premature, were admitted more often to the neonatal intensive care unit, presented with poor neonatal adaptation signs and had higher rates of congenital malformations.",0
All the aforementioned neonatal outcomes were found mainly in the polytherapy subgroup.,0
Conclusions\nThe use of SGAs in polytherapy was prevalent in the assessed cohort and was associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes for both the mother and the child.,0
In utero exposure to SGA monotherapy appears to be associated with less risk to the fetus.,0
"Future research should focus on polytherapy in pregnancy in order to define its reproductive safety and to separate the effects of medication exposure, underlying psychopathology and associated comorbidities.",0
Caption (BOXED-TEXT)\nArticle summary\n\nArticle focuses\nTo investigate the reproductive safety of the second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic (SGA) medications.,0
Key messages\nThe use of SGAs in polytherapy in pregnant women with mental health disorders is presently a common practice and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes for both the mother and the child.,0
In utero exposure to SGA monotherapy appears to be associated with less risk to the fetus.,0
"The reproductive safety of antipsychotic medications should be studied in the reality of polytherapy, associated comorbidities and environmental and genetic confounders.",0
"At present, the largest study to investigate pregnancy outcomes following the maternal use of SGA in monotherapy and in polytherapy, identifying risk behaviours and factors associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.",0
Inability to address confounding by indication and separate the effects of maternal\xa0mental illness and its severity from psychotropic pharmacotherapy on pregnancy outcome.,0
"The women who contacted Motherisk tended to be middle to upper\xa0middle class, whereas a smaller proportion of callers came from the lower socioeconomic and/or immigrant population; however, this may not affect the generalisability of the results, as their outcomes may be confounded by other factors unrelated to the drug effect.",0
"Although the women were recruited prospectively, there are potential limitations in the retrospectivity of a database.",0
The sample size necessary to define a twofold increase of malformation rates of 1–3% above the baseline was insufficient.,0
Introduction\nPsychiatric disorders are among the most common pathologies affecting women of childbearing age.,0
"Recent estimates of the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in pregnancy range from 14% to 30.5%1–3and include mood, anxiety and psychotic disorders.1–4Untreated mental illness during pregnancy is associated with risks to both the mother and the child.5Uncontrolled schizophrenia, depression and bipolar disorder have all been associated with an increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes.6–8The risks associated with uncontrolled mental illness often lead physicians to recommend maintenance of treatment with psychotropic medications throughout gestation.",0
Antipsychotics have been utilised in the treatment of psychiatric disorders for a number of decades.,0
"While the initial drugs, now referred to as first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), demonstrated a profound effect on treatment outcomes, this group of medications is not only associated with serious extrapyramidal complications, but is also known to induce hyperprolactinaemia and to affect fertility.",0
The existing literature on pregnancy outcomes following exposure to FGAs has not shown a significantly increased risk for malformations above the baseline incidence.,0
"Conversely, many FGAs (including haloperidol, chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, thioridazine) have been associated with perinatal complications, particularly when exposure is later in pregnancy.9These include but are not limited to withdrawal symptoms, unstable body temperature, extrapyramidal signs, respiratory distress, seizures and transient neurodevelopmental delay.",0
"Conclusions regarding other FGAs are limited due to either poor methodology or incomplete reporting.9Although the reproductive safety of FGAs is as yet unconfirmed, the adverse side effect profile necessitated the development of newer medications in recent years.",0
"Since the mid-1990s, the use of SGAs has increased drastically and expanded rapidly to the treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders.10–13Furthermore, deinstitutionalisation, the destigmatisation of mental illness and the improved side effect profile of SGAs, particularly the reduced incidence of hyperprolactinaemia in most SGAs, have all contributed to increased fertility rates among treated women.9The rise in birth rate in women with psychiatric disorders, combined with the increase in off-label usage of these medications, has resulted in a significant increase in the number of fetuses exposed to this newer class of antipsychotics.",0
"While SGAs readily cross the placenta,14the existing studies that have investigated the reproductive safety of these agents did not reach conclusive results due to the methodological limitations, small sample sizes and failure to assess SGAs in monotherapy.",0
"The meagre body of literature regarding pregnancy outcomes following the maternal use of SGAs has produced conflicting findings, which may be attributed to the different methodologies and inadequate control for confounding variables.15A number of studies have found that exposure to SGAs is associated with a significantly increased risk of low birth weight16–18and small for gestational age infants, in comparison to healthy controls.17Conversely, Lin et al 17found that the risk of low\xa0birth weight, preterm births and small/large for gestational age (LGA) infants did not differ between women with schizophrenia receiving SGAs and those with the disorder who did not use an antipsychotic drug.",0
"In contrast, Newham et al 19found that neonates exposed to SGAs (n=25) were significantly more likely to be LGA compared with healthy controls.",0
"Furthermore, a large study utilising data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register reported an increased risk of congenital malformations associated with exposure to either a typical antipsychotic or SGA; however, this finding failed to reach statistical significance after controlling for exposure to anticonvulsants.18\nAnother growing concern is the increased use of multiple psychotropic medications in the treatment of mental illness.",0
"A number of studies have shown a significant rise in the incidence of polytherapy with two or more antidepressants, antipsychotics and sedative-hypnotics, as well as an increase in the concomitant prescription of an antidepressant and antipsychotic.151619–24Although polytherapy involving SGAs and other psychotropic medications appears to be increasingly common, no study until now has directly compared the reproductive safety of SGA monotherapy versus polytherapy with other medications.",0
We aimed to investigate the pregnancy outcomes of women receiving SGAs relative to a comparison group of matched healthy controls and to compare the outcomes of antipsychotic monotherapy with polytherapy involving other psychotropic medications.,0
"Women who were exposed to teratogenic medications unrelated to their psychiatric disorder treatment, such as acutane, or who abused substances (eg, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, etc) were excluded from the study cohort.",0
"Fertility-assisted pregnancies, twin/triplet pregnancies or pregnancies with known outcomes at the initial time of contact (eg, contacted Motherisk following the birth, reported abnormal pregnancy screening tests and/or ultrasounds) were excluded from the exposed and comparison groups.",0
"Moreover, control women who reported a history of psychiatric disorders or who were exposed in their current pregnancy to a known teratogen were excluded.",0
"The majority of women in the exposed group reported taking quetiapine (69.9%), followed by olanzapine (16.5%), risperidone (10.5%), aripiprazole (1.5%), paliperidone (0.8%) and quetiapine plus olanzapine (0.8%).",0
"The most common indications for psychotropic medication use were bipolar disorder (36.8%), depression (27.1%), anxiety and depression (9.8%) and sleep disorders (9.8%).",0
"The exposed women weighed significantly more than the controls prior to conception (p<0.001); however, the two groups did not differ with respect to weight gain during pregnancy.",0
The only significant predictor found was group affiliation (p<0.001; Otable 2).,0
Exposed neonates were approximately two and a half times more likely to be premature (gestational age <37\u2005weeks) compared with controls (10.6% vs 4.3%).,0
"We found a significant correlation (at the 0.01 level, two-tailed) between maternal pre-pregnancy weight and neonatal birth weight.",0
Maternal pre-pregnancy weight was the only significant predictor identified (p=0.015).,0
"Although not statistically significant, the rate of major malformations reported in the exposed group was approximately two and a half times higher than in the comparison group (6.2% vs 2.6%).",0
It is important to note that the vast majority of the reported differences between the exposed and comparison groups were found in patients exposed to polytherapy.,0
"Although not reaching statistical significance, more women receiving monotherapy breastfed compared with those receiving polytherapy, and women in the polytherapy group were approximately twice as likely to suffer from hypertension (12.5% vs 5.4%) and gestational diabetes (9.4% vs 5.4%).",0
"Although not statistically significant, it is clinically relevant to report that approximately twice as many neonates exposed to polytherapy were LGA (13.6% vs 6.5%).",0
"All seven major malformations occurring in the exposed group were associated with maternal polytherapy, which reached 8.4% for this subgroup, and no major malformations were reported in the monotherapy group.",0
The observed rate of PNA signs in the monotherapy group was similar to that reported in the healthy comparison group (4% vs 5.2%).,0
"Discussion\nAt present, this is one of the largest studies to investigate pregnancy outcomes following maternal use of SGA monotherapy and polytherapy with other psychotropic medications.",0
"Our data support an increasing trend in the use of SGAs to treat a variety of psychiatric disorders, with bipolar disorder and depression being reported as the two leading indications and quetiapine being the one most commonly used.",0
"We found that 76% (n=101) of women were exposed to SGAs throughout pregnancy and 72% of the assessed cohort received psychotropic drugs in polytherapy, which is in agreement with previous reports.16192122Frye et al 23stated that the proportion of polytherapy treatment increased from 3.3% in 1974–1979 to 44% in 1990–1995.24Recent studies indicate that this trend towards polytherapy continues to rise, reaching up to 80%.22Interestingly, Centorrino and colleagues maintained that there are no apparent advantages in opting for treatments with multiple antipsychotics.",0
"These findings are consistent with recent reports of increased polytherapy involving antipsychotics and antidepressants in the USA,20as well as in other cohorts of pregnant women.14161921\nWe found that women in the exposed and comparison groups differed significantly with respect to a number of characteristics and behaviours that are known to be associated with increased risks for adverse pregnancy outcomes.",0
"Exposed women weighed significantly more prior to becoming pregnant, although body mass index could not be calculated due to the lack of available data on maternal height.",0
"This finding is consistent with reports of significant weight gain induced by SGAs.25–28There were no differences in maternal weight gain during pregnancy, and as such, more consideration should be given to the management of preconceptional weight.",0
"In addition, significantly higher proportions of exposed women smoked more cigarettes during pregnancy and were less likely to breastfeed and take prenatal vitamins.",0
"The increased proportion of preterm deliveries observed in the exposed group may be influenced by maternal pre-pregnancy weight, as was reported in a recent paper by Khatibi et al.",0
"29Moreover, in agreement with a recent population-based cohort study that reported an increased incidence of gestational diabetes in mothers taking SGAs during pregnancy,28the exposed women in our cohort experienced more associated comorbidities, including hypertension, gestational diabetes and hypothyroidism.",0
"Although these latter findings were not statistically significant, they may be of clinical relevance.",0
"However, the exposed group did have a significantly increased rate of LGA neonates.",0
"It is of interest to note that, in spite of the large proportion of exposed women who exhibited characteristics commonly associated with risk for small for gestational age neonates (eg, smoking, hypertension), an increased rate of LGA neonates was observed.",0
Such results may be considered in context with exposure to psychotropic drugs.,0
"Although 14.3% of exposed mothers were also taking an antiepileptic drug, primarily lamotrigine, the reported malformations were not found among those infants exposed to anticonvulsants.",0
The present report is one of the first to compare the pregnancy outcomes of women receiving SGA monotherapy with those receiving SGAs in polytherapy.,0
"Although women from both the monotherapy and polytherapy subgroups did not differ in their age at conception, pre-pregnancy weight, pregnancy weight gain and neonatal birth weight, the women exposed to polytherapy took fewer vitamins, smoked more cigarettes, experienced a significantly shorter gestation, tended to breastfeed less and delivered twice as many LGA neonates.",0
Neonates exposed to polytherapy were five times more likely to present with PNA signs compared with those exposed to monotherapy.,0
"Although some of these differences did not reach statistical significance (table 4), it appears that polytherapy with SGAs and other psychotropic medications may be associated with a higher risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, compared with SGA monotherapy.",0
"The reported results should be considered with caution, given the small sample size of our cohort and that previously published case reports have observed healthy outcomes in neonates/infants prenatally exposed to SGA polytherapy.30–34\nMaternal pre-pregnancy characteristics and behavioural risk factors may be considered when interpreting the findings of the present study.",0
"[""For example, maternal pre-pregnancy weight, specifically being overweight or obese, has been shown to be independently associated with an elevated risk for LGA births.35–38Although this study is the first to corroborate Newham et al 's19report of increased risks of LGA deliveries in women exposed to SGAs, the study design was not able to adequately separate the effect of pre-pregnancy weight on this outcome.""]",0
"Thus, it is unclear whether exposure to SGAs may cause fetal-weight gain directly or indirectly by inducing maternal\xa0weight gain prior to conception.",0
"Nevertheless, the findings are in contrast to a previously published study which found that in utero exposure to SGAs was associated with a significantly elevated risk of small for gestational age births.16However, it is possible that this difference may be due to the lack of control of potential confounders, such as maternal indication for smoking or substance use during pregnancy.",0
"Twenty-four per cent of women in this earlier study reportedly suffered from schizophrenia, a severe psychiatric disorder that is independently associated with an increased risk for small for gestational age and low\xa0birth weight births.17In contrast, only 3% of women in the present study reported a diagnosis of schizophrenia.",0
"Similarly, 38% of exposed women in this earlier study, in contrast to 18% in the current study, reported smoking during pregnancy—a risk factor that has also been associated with elevated risks of small for gestational age39–41and intrauterine growth-restricted42neonates.",0
"Further studies controlling for known predictors of LGA are necessary to confirm the findings, and an exploration of the potential biological mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon is warranted.",0
"To our knowledge, the present study is the first to show a significant association between maternal SGA use in pregnancy and an elevated risk of NICU admission.",0
"The 25% prevalence rate of NICU admissions found in the exposed group of the present study is the same as that reported in a recent retrospective chart review, although only 16 women were assessed.43\nOur results also suggest that polytherapy in pregnancy may be associated with shorter gestation and increased rates of LGA neonates, instrumental deliveries, fetal distress during delivery, NICU admissions and neonates presenting with PNA symptoms.",0
"Such findings may have important clinical relevance, as the rates of many adverse delivery/neonatal outcomes were at least twice as high in the polytherapy group.",0
"Importantly, among the exposed group, all seven major malformations occurred among the 96 women receiving polytherapy; however, no specific pattern of malformation was found.",0
"The association between polytherapy exposure and higher rates of malformations should be considered in the context of the small sample size, severity of the baseline disorder that required polytherapy, associated comorbidities, as well as any other unknown environmental factors that were not assessed in this study.",0
"Considering that exposure to SGA monotherapy was not associated with birth defects in our cohort and that the majority of pregnant women with psychiatric disorders are on psychotropic drug polytherapy, research on the reproductive safety of these medications should reflect this reality.",0
"Moreover, further research is required in order to separate the effects of polytherapy from the baseline mental illness, as well as the genetic and environmental confounders on pregnancy outcome, particularly as those receiving psychotropic polytherapy may suffer from more severe and persistent psychiatric disorders.",0
"The higher prevalence of PNA signs found in the exposed group, compared with the controls, may be driven by concurrent SSRI exposure, as 12 of the 15 neonates that presented with PNA symptoms were also exposed to an SSRI.",0
"Although the measurement scales specific for the PNA syndrome are not available, numerous studies have found that use of SSRI late in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of infants developing this clinical presentation,4445which is also labelled as Prenatal Antidepressant Exposure Syndrome.46The three remaining neonates in our cohort who displayed PNA symptoms were prenatally exposed to an SGA but not to an SSRI.",0
"Similar to the present study, Mendhekar et al 47in 2006 described a neonate who presented with unexplained fetal distress following prenatal exposure to aripiprazole.",0
"Such findings have been echoed by the US Food and Drug Administration in recently issued warnings suggesting that, similar to SSRIs, antipsychotics may cause PNA syndrome.48In the present study, 82.6% of neonates admitted to the NICU were exposed to polytherapy, mostly with SSRIs.",0
"Given the predominance of polytherapy involving these two classes of medications in the treatment of various psychiatric disorders in pregnant women, designing future cohort studies aimed at investigating the relative and combined effects of prenatal exposure to SGAs and antidepressants is of considerable importance.",0
There are a number of limitations inherent in the design of the present study that should be acknowledged.,0
"Given the small sample size, unadjusted models were used in most of the analyses.",0
"Therefore, we were unable to fully assess the influence of confounding factors in SGA monotherapy.",0
Such results should be further investigated in future research.,0
Another limitation is the inability to address confounding by indication and separate the relative effects of maternal mental illness from psychotropic pharmacotherapy on pregnancy outcome.,0
"Moreover, a more detailed investigation into maternal\xa0mental health, which includes measures of the frequency and severity of specific psychiatric symptoms during pregnancy, would allow for a more thorough investigation into these critical confounding variables.",0
"Furthermore, evaluating the social characteristics of the assessed cohort would enable us to identify potential confounding variables that may affect pregnancy outcomes, such as socioeconomic status and lifestyle differences.",0
"The women who contacted Motherisk tended to be middle to upper-middle class, which represents the majority of the population, and may be higher functioning than those who did not, as they independently sought access to counselling in order to help educate themselves on the potential teratogenic risks associated with their medications.16A smaller proportion of callers came from the lower socioeconomic and/or immigrant population; however, this may not affect the generalisability of the results, as their outcomes may be confounded by other factors unrelated to the drug effect.",0
"Although the women were recruited prospectively, there are potential limitations in the retrospectivity of a database.",0
"In conclusion, it appears that psychotropic polytherapy in pregnant women with mental\xa0health disorders is presently a common practice.",0
"However, such management may lead to an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.",0
"Considering that reports that polytherapy do not commonly alter the course and outcome of the baseline disorder,2224indications for polytherapy in pregnant women should be seriously considered and made on an individual basis following a thorough risk/benefit analysis.",0
"The reproductive safety of antipsychotic medications should be studied using a prospective design and a powerful sample size and in the reality of polytherapy, associated comorbidities and environmental and genetic confounders.",0
Born Too Soon: Accelerating actions for prevention and care of 15 million newborns born too soon\n\nAbstract\nPreterm birth complication is the leading cause of neonatal death resulting in over one million deaths each year of the 15 million babies born preterm.,0
"To accelerate change, we provide an overview of the comprehensive strategy required, the tools available for context-specific health system implementation now, and the priorities for research and innovation.",0
There is an urgent need for action on a dual track: (1) through strategic research to advance the prevention of preterm birth and (2) improved implementation and innovation for care of the premature neonate.,0
"We highlight evidence-based interventions along the continuum of care, noting gaps in coverage, quality, equity and implications for integration and scale up.",0
Improved metrics are critical for both burden and tracking programmatic change.,0
"[""Linked to the United Nation's Every Women Every Child strategy, a target was set for 50% reduction in preterm deaths by 2025.""]",0
"Three analyses informed this target: historical change in high income countries, recent progress in best performing countries, and modelling of mortality reduction with high coverage of existing interventions.",0
"If universal coverage of selected interventions were to be achieved, then 84% or more than 921,000 preterm neonatal deaths could be prevented annually, with antenatal corticosteroids and Kangaroo Mother Care having the highest impact.",0
"Everyone has a role to play in reaching this target including government leaders, professionals, private sector, and of course families who are affected the most and whose voices have been critical for change in many of the countries with the most progress.",0
"[""Preterm birth as a marker for women's and children's health\nThe Born Too Soon report, published in 2012, drew global attention to the issue of preterm birth and reported that more than 1 in 10 of the world's babies are born too soon each year, 15 million each year [1].""]",0
"As part of a series entitled ""Born Too Soon"" drawing from the report, this final paper summarises the problem, underlining the need for concerted action on both the prevention of preterm birth and care of the premature baby, to ensure every mother and every baby survives [2-6].",0
"We then highlight evidence-based interventions for preterm birth in the context of the wider health system drawing on the other papers in this supplement, and here we focus on the implications for integrating and scaling up those available interventions in low- and middle-income countries where the coverage of care is lowest and the potential lives saved as a result.",0
"We also consider research gaps since advancing the research agenda is a critical need to reduce the global burden of preterm birth, requiring innovations for both prevention and care.",0
"Finally we detail the analyses for a mortality reduction target for preterm specific neonatal deaths and outline the specific roles all actors must play in this global effort to reduce preterm birth and care for premature babies, which is a marker of the health and care of women and girls, as well as of progress for child survival and development.",0
"[""The actions identified aim to support the goals of the Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health launched by the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in September 2010 to further advance progress for the Millennium Development Goal 4 for child survival and the Every Woman Every Child movement to mobilise action and resources for these goals [7].""]",0
"By pooling our efforts with each organisation playing to its strengths, our shared goal, as epitomised in Every Woman Every Child , can be realised -- a day when pregnancies are wanted and safe, women survive, babies everywhere get a healthy start in life, and children thrive.",0
Accelerating evidence-based action for prevention and care\nAddressing the burden of preterm birth has a dual track--prevention and care (Figure1).,0
"Reducing risks before, during, and between pregnancies through preconception and antenatal care packages may help preterm birth prevention [4,5].",0
"Actions taken during labour and birth, and particularly improved care of the neonate have been shown to have major impact [5,6].",0
"For example, antenatal corticosteroids administered to a pregnant woman in preterm labour can prevent respiratory distress syndrome in premature babies reducing newborn mortality and morbidity [5].",0
"In addition, many of these interventions, such as obstetric care and antibiotics for prelabour premature rupture of membranes (pPROM), also benefit maternal health and prevent stillbirths [8].",0
"Prevention of preterm birth is primarily a knowledge gap\nDespite the burden of preterm birth, few effective prevention strategies are available for clinicians, policy-makers and program managers.",0
"Multiple studies in high-income contexts have attempted to prevent preterm birth, but have not yet identified high-impact interventions in the preconception and antenatal periods.",0
"Many interventions have been evaluated, and some have been identified as beneficial though limited in public health impact, such as therapy with progestational agents, which have only been studied in certain high-risk populations.",0
"Preliminary studies of interventions to reduce rates of elective caesarean births or inductions without medical indication before the recommended 39 completed weeks of gestation suggest an impact on prevention of early term deliveries in some high- and middle-income countries [9,10].",0
"A recent study published in The Lancet examined preterm birth prevention potential in 39 high-income countries and estimated that if five interventions reached high coverage there would only be a 5% relative reduction of preterm birth rate from 9·59% to 9·07% of livebirths by 2015, averting an estimated 58,000 preterm births and saving US$3 billion annually [11].",0
"The limited number and effectiveness of available interventions for preterm prevention further underscores this critical major knowledge gap, and makes the case for a strategic and coordinated research effort to advance understanding of causes and mechanisms of preterm birth and identification of innovative solutions.",0
"However, the low- and middle-income countries with the highest burden of preterm births also carry the greatest burden of higher-risk conditions for preterm birth that are preventable or treatable.",0
"Interventions such as family planning; prevention and management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs); use of insecticide-treated bednets and intermittent preventive treatment for malaria; identification and treatment of pre-eclampsia, and reduction of physical workload are examples of strategies that could improve birth outcomes in in low- and middle-income settings.",0
"Unfortunately, to date, few studies have assessed the impact of these interventions on preterm birth in these countries, particularly with accurate measures of gestational age [12].",0
"The greatest potential for the global prevention of preterm birth, therefore, lies in a comprehensive, strategic, and sufficiently-funded research agenda of the causes of preterm birth and novel strategies for prevention [13].",0
This should be vigorously pursued.,0
There are some significant intrapartum interventions that reduce the impact of preterm birth.,0
"Antenatal corticosteroid injections given to women in preterm labour are highly effective at preventing respiratory distress syndrome in premature babies and associated mortality and long-term impairment, but remain under-used in many low- and some middle-income countries.",0
"There is, thus, a need for delivery research that can help understand context-specific reasons for the continued low coverage in these countries and identify ways to adapt known effective strategies for use in low-resource settings [14].",0
"Tocolytic medicines rarely stop preterm labour, but may help delay labour for hours or days, allowing the baby additional precious time to develop before birth.",0
"Of course, any strategies to prolong labour, including delaying caesarean birth, must be evaluated against the potential risk of continued exposure of woman and foetus to sub-optimal conditions that may result in harmful effects.",0
Further research is needed on short and long-term health consequences for mother and baby from efforts to prevent preterm labour [5].,0
"Care of premature babies is primarily an action gap\nAs evidenced by the large survival gap between babies born in high-income countries and those born in low- and middle-income countries, effective interventions exist to reduce death and disability in premature babies, yet this care does not reach the poor and most disadvantaged populations where the burden is highest [6].",0
"There is a ""know-do gap"", or a gap between what is known to work and what is done in practice.",0
"Bridging this gap will be critical for saving premature babies globally, and must be linked to implementation research and context specific adaptation and innovation.",0
"Most preterm births occur over 32 weeks of gestation (84%), and deaths in these babies can almost all be prevented and in most cases, intensive care is not needed [6] (Figure1).",0
"[""It is possible to implement some evidence-based interventions for the care of premature babies at the community level through behaviour change initiatives and women's groups [16], as well as home-visit packages with extra care for premature babies, particularly breastfeeding support and awareness of the importance of seeking care when danger signs occur [17].""]",0
"However, the highest impact interventions, notably access to quality intrapartum care and emergency obstetric and newborn care [19], require facility-based services.",0
"Antenatal corticosteroids and Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) are evidence-based interventions that are feasible to scale up in low-resource settings and may serve as entry points for strengthening health systems [20,21].",0
"Scaling up preterm birth interventions within the existing health system\nThere is increasing global consensus around essential reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) interventions [22,23], including those to address preterm birth (Figure2).",0
"The goal is to achieve universal, equitable coverage and high quality in all these RMNCH interventions.",0
"Newborn babies, and especially premature newborns, are the most sensitive test of health systems function as these babies can die within minutes without the right care.",0
"For sustainable effect, interventions to prevent preterm birth in the preconception and antenatal periods and to reduce death and disability in premature babies must be integrated within the existing health system.",0
"An effective continuum of care addresses the health needs of the adolescent, woman, mother, newborn and child throughout the life cycle, wherever care is provided, whether it be at the home, primary care level or district and regional hospitals.",0
"Most importantly, they can help prevent stillbirths, improve prevention and care of premature babies and avert death and disability in women, newborns and children [25-27].",0
"Interventions with the highest impact on the prevention of preterm birth and care of the premature baby in high-mortality and lower-resource settings can be integrated into these health service delivery packages, which exist in most health systems and involve links with maternal and child health services, as well as immunisation, malaria, HIV/AIDS, nutrition, family planning, and other related programs [22].",0
"The interventions within each package are based on multiple systematic reviews and are consistent with the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health Essential Interventions report [23].",0
"While these packages may exist in nearly all health systems, lower-income countries cannot scale up and implement all the individual RMNCH interventions within all the packages at once [25].",0
Packages usually are initially comprised of the essential interventions and then increase in complexity over time according to local needs and capacity.,0
"The functionality of health systems, such as human resource capacity, health facility infrastructure, supply and demand systems, financial resources, government stewardship, district-level management and use of data, will also determine the coverage, quality and rate of change within the continuum of care [28].",0
"Closing gaps in coverage, equity and quality\nIn order for health services to save the maximum number of lives, coverage, quality and equity need to be high; thus ensuring high coverage of care means reaching every woman, mother-to-be, mother, newborn, child and family with targeted interventions.",0
"Providing equitable care means ensuring care for all according to need, rather than income, gender or other social grouping.",0
This holds true for the existing inequalities in care within and across high-income as well as low- and middle-income countries.,0
"Previous papers in this supplement have identified gaps in coverage, quality, equity and metrics for care during preconception, pregnancy and care of preterm newborns [4-6].",0
"[""Current coverage levels for eight indicators across the continuum of care, chosen by the United Nations Commission on Information and Accountability for Women's and Children's Health, are tracked for the 75 priority Countdown to 2015 countries which collectively account for 90% of maternal, newborn and child deaths [29].""]",0
"Currently, essential care reaches only half of the people in need (Figure3), and there is a wide variation in coverage levels among countries, with some countries achieving nearly universal coverage and others reaching less than a quarter of the population.",0
"Demand for family planning satisfied and antenatal care coverage, even though feasible through primary care services, still leave out many women, especially the poorest.",0
"In addition, quality gaps are a missed opportunity for reaching families; for example, when a midwife is present at birth but is not equipped to prevent post partum haemorrhage or to resuscitate a baby who does not breathe [5,6].",0
"Substantial progress is still needed for the reduction of maternal and newborn deaths, especially for effective, high quality at the vital contact times (e.g., skilled attendant at birth and postnatal care) [29].",0
"Currently, there are no routine data available for many of the interventions for preterm birth prevention and care.",0
"A research pipeline to address preterm birth\nGreater investment in research and, in particular, into discovery of the many complex and interrelated factors causing preterm birth is needed to strengthen prevention and offers a potential over the longer term for significant reductions in mortality, childhood disability and healthcare expenditure.",0
"For care of preterm babies, the emphasis is on rapidly scaling up implementations, so that the maximum number of preterm babies and their mothers benefit.",0
Implementation research is needed to understand the most efficient means of scaling up evidenced based solutions.,0
"In this way, hundreds of thousands of lives could be saved with the application of current knowledge.",0
"Hence, there will not be a single solution, but rather an array of solutions that address the various biological, clinical, behavioural and social risk factors that result in preterm birth.",0
"This supplement identifies risks for preterm birth and the solutions needed to reduce those risks across the RMNCH continuum; yet for many of these risks, we do not have effective solutions.",0
"A strategic research approach is needed to understand why babies are born preterm or as stillbirths, how to identify women at risk, to test strategies for prevention and care, and reduce death and disability rates for preterm neonates.",0
"For the preterm prevention research agenda, the greatest emphasis is on discovery and descriptive research, which is a longer-term investment.",0
"For the premature baby care agenda, the greatest emphasis is on development and delivery research, with a shorter timeline to impact at scale.",0
"Descriptive research\nImproved and consistently applied epidemiologic definitions and methods, with clearly defined preterm phenotypes, are the foundation for improved understanding of the burden of preterm birth [31,32] and addressing the multiple and often interrelated causes of preterm birth.",0
Simpler and lower-cost methods for measuring gestational age are particularly needed in low- and middle-income countries where the burden of preterm birth is highest.,0
"Social and racial disparities in preterm birth rates are a major issue, yet remain poorly understood.",0
"Another important need is for standardised methods for diagnosing and treating prematurity-related impairment in childhood and more consistent measures and timing for assessing multi-domain impairments [33,34].",0
"Discovery research\nDiscovery research focuses on better understanding the causes and mechanisms of preterm birth and elucidating factors that regulate uterine quiescence, initiation of labour, and the multiple host, agent, and environmental factors that cause aberrations in these normal processes of pregnancy.",0
"Understanding the reasons for racial and ethnic disparities in preterm birth will advance the field of pregnancy health broadly, as well as accelerate solutions for those populations most in need.",0
"A multi-disciplinary approach is needed to identify women at risk and discover new strategies for prevention including potential biomarkers, such as genomic, microbial, immunologic, and hormonal factors.",0
"Although infectious and inflammatory processes contribute to a high proportion of early spontaneous preterm births [35], antibiotic treatment of reproductive tract infections, especially bacterial vaginosis and other remote site infections, has generally failed to reduce preterm risk [36].",0
"Many pre-existing chronic conditions and medical complications of pregnancy may result in increased risk of preterm delivery, such as pre-eclampsia, hypertension, aberrations in placentation and placental growth, diabetes and infectious diseases.",0
"Identifying mechanisms of these conditions, and strategies for early detection, prevention, and care, represent an important need for reducing the global burden of preterm birth.",0
New strategies for prevention are particularly urgent for use in low- and middle-income settings where rates are highest.,0
"Development research\nEquipment and commodities are considered essential for neonatal care units in high-income countries, yet for many such units in low-income settings, basic equipment and essential medicines are not available or functional.",0
"Development of robust, fit-for-purpose equipment, is a critical next frontier for referral care for premature babies in the settings where most die, especially for care in hospitals [6].",0
"Some examples include technologies for ventilatory support, novel surfactant formulations, safe and effective intravenous fluid and drug administration, devices for testing bilirubin levels for jaundice and innovative phototherapy equipment [6].",0
New and effective methods for monitoring and management of maternal complications and preterm labour could make a major contribution.,0
"Commodities, such as antenatal corticosteroids, could reach more women and babies though innovation for example in single-dose syringes or, ideally, needle-free devices [37].",0
"In many high-income countries and those with emerging economies, there is evidence of an increase in late preterm deliveries due to elective inductions and caesareans without clear medical indication [38].",0
More information is urgently needed from both providers and patients on the reasons for these shifts in clinical practice and how to promote more conservative obstetric management.,0
The vast majority of published studies on neonatal care relate to high-technology care in high-income settings [39].,0
"Implementation research from low- and middle-income settings is critical to inform and accelerate the scale up of high-impact care, such as KMC and neonatal resuscitation [19,21,40].",0
"Evaluation of context-specific neonatal care packages regarding outcome, cost and economic results is important, including adaptations such as task shifting to various cadres and use of innovative technologies [41].",0
"There is also a need to understand how to screen more effectively for and treat possible prematurity-related cognitive, motor and behavioural disabilities, including in older children.",0
"In addition, the economics of preterm birth prevention and care, including the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness of interventions delivered singly or as a package across the continuum of care and in different settings and populations as well as the costs of doing nothing, need to be better studied [12,42].",0

"Expanding training, research opportunities and mentorship for researchers in low-income settings hold great promise in developing a pipeline of expertise to advance the science with the skills to use this science effectively to promote change [30].",0
"Potential for lives saved\nTo understand the impact of evidence-based interventions on deaths due to complications of preterm birth, we considered analyses including historical data from high income countries (Figure4), recent change in middle income countries (Figures5and6) and a new analysis using lives saved modelling.",0
"History lessons from neonatal mortality reduction in high income countries\nThe historical data from the United States and United Kingdom (Figure4) shows that a moderate increase in coverage of selected interventions results in a mortality reduction, even in the absence of neonatal intensive care.",0
"A number of lessons can be drawn from this historical data:\nBasic care and infection case management interventions have an effect on neonatal deaths and on deaths amongst moderate and late preterm births, which account for over 80% of preterm births.",0
"More targeted care is necessary for reducing deaths among babies 28 to <32 weeks and this reduction could be accelerated as higher-impact interventions are now known, such as antenatal corticosteroids, surfactant, KMC and other enhanced methods of infant warming and feeding which were not available in the mid-20th century in the United States and United Kingdom.",0
"Intensive care may be necessary to reduce deaths among extremely premature babies (< 28 weeks), who account for 5% of all premature babies though a larger proportion of deaths.",0
"[""Lives saved modelling for preterm mortality reduction\nA Lives Saved Tool ( LiST ) analysis examining projected lives saved with interventions for preterm birth was conducted for 75 Countdown to 2015 priority countries (These countries are: Afghanistan, Angola, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Benin, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, China, Comoros, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Kenya, Democratic Republic of Korea, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mexico, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Sudan, Swaziland, Tajikistan, United Republic of Tanzania, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uganda, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Yemen, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.).""]",0
"The modelling methods have been widely published including discussions of the limitations, which are particularly related to the lack of coverage data for many of the specific interventions [44-47].",0
We considered the period from 2010 to 2015 and then through 2025 to allow for a more feasible time frame to scale up care and progress on the prevention agenda.,0
"The results of the LiST analysis found that 84% of premature babies (more than 921,000 lives) could be saved in 2025 if these interventions were made universally available (95%).",0
"Full coverage of antenatal corticosteroids alone resulted in high mortality reductions, a 41% decrease from 2010 [20].",0
"Implementing KMC alone also suggests that a high reduction of deaths could be achieved [21], averting approximately 531,000 neonatal deaths in 2025.",0
"If these two interventions were added to existing health system packages, especially noting the recent shifts to more facility births in Africa and Asia, then a high impact is possible even in a relatively short time frame.",0
"Note that obstetric care would also have an impact, but is not estimated separately\n\nTargets for action by 2025\nThe Born Too Soon report initiated a process towards achieving goals for preterm birth prevention and presented a new goal for the reduction of deaths due to complications of preterm birth (Figure7) [48].",0
"The latter goal was set through consultation by a group of technical experts, and several analyses were undertaken to inform this target, notably (1) projections by country of the deaths due to preterm birth from now until 2025, assuming no change in trends and assuming expected changes in Gross National Income (GNI); (2) reduction in preterm-specific neonatal mortality if the historical trends from the United Kingdom or the United States (Figure4) were applied or if more rapid recent reductions in middle-income countries were applied (Figures5and6); (3) preterm-specific neonatal mortality reductions predicted based on coverage changes according to the Lives Saved Tool Modelling (Table2).",0
"Scenario 1: ""Business as usual""\nShould governments and the global community take no further direct action to address deaths due to preterm birth, mortality will decline by 24% by 2025 according to an analysis of regional trends over the past decade and forward projection (or 16%, if the projection is based on forecasted GNI change) (Figure4).",0
"Given this scenario and taking into account changing numbers of births, the global total of preterm deaths will not reduce significantly by 2025, with around 900,000 premature babies continuing to die every year.",0
Scenario 2: Countries take action to catch up with top performers within their region\nPreterm mortality could be halved by 2025 if governments took action now to match the top performers within their regions or to match the historical reductions in the United States and the United Kingdom from basic interventions before widespread use of intensive care (Figure4).,0
"The examples of Sri Lanka and Turkey (see Figure5) present examples of significant reduction in mortality, halving deaths in 10 years linked to scale up of intensive care.",0
Even those countries with higher mortality rates that are not yet ready to scale up intensive care could see a 50% reduction as shown in the mid-20th century in the United States and the United Kingdom.,0
"This reduction is achievable with improved essential care of premature babies and better case management of infections and respiratory distress syndrome, especially since the deaths of moderately-preterm babies are the most common and preventable ones.",0
"There are high-impact, cost-effective interventions currently at low coverage [5,6], such as antenatal corticosteroids and KMC, that could significantly accelerate progress, which were not available in the United States and the United Kingdom in the middle of the 20th century when the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) was significantly reduced.",0
"Hence, it would be expected, with the inclusion of these and other innovations, that mortality reduction could be more rapid than for the historical examples.",0
"Scenario 3: Countries achieve universal coverage of basic interventions\nShould governments adopt universal coverage of interventions (95%) ensuring that every woman and child who needs an intervention receives it, then, according to the LiST analysis (Table2) and the historical data (Figure4), countries could achieve an 84% reduction of 1.1 million deaths due to preterm birth complications.",0
"While ensuring a 95% coverage rate is ideal and would result in a major mortality reduction, this process will take time.",0
"Initiating these changes can start to move countries toward their goal of preterm mortality reduction while also preventing death due to other causes of newborn death, as well as maternal deaths and stillbirths, through shared interventions such as skilled care at birth.",0
Call to action\nBorn Too Soon is sobering in the news of a large burden and in the personal stories of loss behind that burden.,0
"Yet this is also a story of hope in the significant opportunities for change, especially as we approach the final sprint for the MDG 4 target and aim to maintain momentum beyond 2015.",0
These first-ever country estimates of preterm birth leave us without the excuse of ignorance [3].,0
"The problem is increasing - for the countries with 20-year trend data, the majority show an increase in preterm birth rates [3].",0
"Additionally, the burden is not shared equally, with the impact of preterm birth falling most severely on the poorest families and in low- and middle-income countries where health systems are less prepared to respond.",0
"Preterm birth is a problem that we all share; therefore, the solutions must also be shared, and won through cooperation, collaboration and coordination of the many constituencies and stakeholders.",0

Differential Expression of Placental Glucocorticoid Receptors and Growth Arrest-Specific Transcript 5 in Term and Preterm Pregnancies: Evidence for Involvement of Maternal Stress\n\nAbstract\nPregnancy-specific stress predicts birth outcomes.,0
We hypothesized that there is a maternal stress-GR interaction that can influence fetal birth weight.,0
"[""This study examined the relationship between mothers' stress and attitude towards their pregnancies, placental glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) expression, and the status of GR polymorphism, with their infants' birth weights.""]",0
"GAS5 and GR α were the predominant transcripts in both term and preterm placentas, with GAS5 being primarily localized in the syncytiotrophoblasts.",0
"In an attempt to mimic moderate and high stress environment in vitro , BeWo and JEG-3 cytotrophoblast cell lines were treated with 10\u2009nM–1000\u2009nM cortisol.",0
"Only expression of GAS5 was significantly upregulated by cortisol in all treatments compared with basal levels, but none of the GRs changed expression significantly.",0
"In an attempt to assess a stress versus gene interaction, we studied four GR polymorphisms.",0
"In the homozygous group for Tth111 I polymorphism, mothers with negative attitudes towards the pregnancy gave birth to infants with significantly lower birth weights compared to women with positive/neutral attitudes.",0
"However, placental GAS5 levels were inversely correlated with maternal stress.",0
This study points towards a potential gene-environment interaction that could be of predictive value for fetal weight.,0
Introduction\nPregnancy is associated with major physiological and future psychosocial changes and adaptation to these changes is crucial for normal fetal development and for healthy infant-mother relationships.,0
Maternal pregnancy-specific stress may be a more powerful contributor to birth outcomes than general stress [1].,0
"To date, four splice variants of the GR gene have been reported, formed by alternative splicing, termed GR α , GR β , GR γ , and GR-P [2].",0
Numerous studies have also reported the expression of different GR splice variants in different cell and tissue types [3–6].,0
"In a recent study by Kino and colleagues it was demonstrated that GAS5 ncRNA may be a repressor for the GR by acting as a decoy “glucocorticoid response element (GRE),” thus, competing with DNA GREs for binding to the GR.",0
Changes in the epigenetic regulation of the fetal GR promoter have been associated with exposure to prenatal maternal stress [9] reflecting a possible effect of maternal stress on the expression and function of the GR in the fetus.,0
"A GR Bcl I polymorphism has been associated with increased glucocorticoid sensitivity and was overrepresented in pregnant women with pathological, fetomaternal immune adaptation.",0
"Indeed, a number of polymorphisms have been described in the gene coding for the GR although it is still unclear whether the variability in the glucocorticoid responses observed is due to the polymorphisms or to other factors [10].",0
This sensitivity could be one mechanism linking maternal stress to fetal development.,0
"Only few of these polymorphisms are functionally relevant and these are the Tth111 I, the ER22/23EK, the N363S, the—already mentioned— Bcl I, and the GR-9 β .",0
"Studies have shown that at least three polymorphisms are associated with altered glucocorticoid sensitivity and also with changes in body composition and metabolic parameters [10,11], which could affect fetal development as well.",0
"[""This study examined the relationship between mothers' stress levels and attitude towards their pregnancies, placental GR and GAS5 expression, and the status of GR polymorphism, with their infants' birth weights.""]",0
We also examined the maternal attitude versus gene interaction in relation to fetal birth weight.,0
"Moreover, we tested the effect of cortisol on GR splicing and GAS5 expression of BeWo and JEG-3 placental cells, in an attempt to resemble a low, moderate, and high stress milieu in vitro .",0
The exact cause of maternal stress was not identified.,0
"[""We also tested the relationships between continuous predictors (women's age, stress) and infant weight, using Pearson correlations and partial correlations (when adjusting for age and BMI) and using\u2009 t -tests for dichotomous predictors (e.g., planned pregnancy) and ANOVA for testing the relationship between attitude type and infant birth weight, while controlling statistically for relevant confounders such as mothers' age, BMI, pregnancy planning, and pregnancy nutritional habits.""]",0
"Expression of Placental GAS5 and GRs\nQuantitative RT-PCR revealed that GAS5 and all GRs were expressed in human placentas ( n = 23); 13 were preterm labor (<37 gestational weeks) and 10 were term (>37 gestational weeks) labor, with GAS5 and GR α being the predominant transcripts.",0
It is evident that the major transcripts in the human placenta are GR α and GAS5.,0
"When relative mRNA abundance was calculated, an approximate 4-fold change in the GR α /GR-P in the preterm labor group was noted compared with the term group.",0
"In addition, a twofold increase in the GR α /GAS5 ratio was also noted in the preterm group compared to the term group (seeTable 2).",0
"In term placentas, there was a significant correlation between GR β and GR γ ( r = 0.580, P = 0.038) and with GR-P ( r = 0.980, P< 0.001).",0
"In the preterm group, the dynamics of GR splicing were altered, since GR α correlated with GR-P ( r = 0.710, P = 0.021) and GR β correlated with GAS5 ( r = 0.792, P = 0.011).",0
"However, no significant correlation was noted in the preterm group between fetal weight or maternal stress and the relative expression of GRs and GAS5.",0
"In the term group, the only significant correlation was between GAS5 and maternal stress ( r = −0.711, P = 0.021).",0
"Due to ethical restrictions, we were only able to assess the expression of GR α / β in 4 term and 3 preterm placentas.",0
"Since GR is present as different isoforms, multiple bands were observed and there was an expected interpatient variation in the protein expression.",0
Scanning densitometry of the bands corresponding to GR α / β normalized over GAPDH revealed no apparent differences in the expression of these variants between the term and the preterm groups (Figure 1(b)).,0
"Strong homogeneous staining mainly in the cytoplasm is detected in the syncytiotrophoblast cells on the outermost layer of the placental villi, with some scattered expression in cytotrophoblast cells (Figure 2(a)).",0
"Using RNA FISH, GAS5 localized primarily in syncytiotrophoblasts (Figure 2(c)).",0
This is a first time that GAS5 localization has been studied in human placentas.,0
GAS5 was significantly lower in expression in JEG-3 cells when compared to BeWo under basal conditions (Figure 3(a)).,0
"For the GRs, significantly higher expression levels were detected only for GR γ and GR-P in the JEG-3 cells compared to the BeWo cells (Figure 3(b)).",0
"When BeWo and JEG-3 cells were treated with cortisol 10\u2009nM, 100\u2009nM, or 1000\u2009nM, the expression of GAS5 was significantly upregulated (all P< 0.05) compared with their corresponding basal levels (Figure 4(a)).",0
"However, cortisol treatments did not exert any significant changes in the gene expression of GR α (Figure 4(b)), GR β (Figure 4(c)), GR γ (Figure 4(d)), and GR-P in either of the cell lines (Figure 4(e)).",0
"In addition, there were no apparent changes in protein expression of GR α / β in BeWo cells treated with 10–1000\u2009nM of cortisol, corroborating the qPCR studies (data not shown).",0
"[""Since the maternal attitude towards the pregnancy was a significant predictor of fetal birth weight, we reexamined this association as a function of the GR genepolymorphisms, resembling a gene-environment interaction and statistically controlling for mothers' age, BMI, pregnancy planning, and pregnancy nutritional habits, to remove any potential sources of statistical bias that could skew our data.""]",0
"Statistical analysis of the maternal Tht111 I polymorphism has shown an inverse correlation between negative maternal attitude and infant birth weight ( r = −0.41, P = 0.030), only in Tht111 I CC polymorphism subgroup.",0
"In Tht111 I CT, no significant correlations were noted, controlling for age, BMI, pregnancy planning, and consumption of fast food during pregnancy.",0
"These data point towards an interaction between stress and genetics, since only in the CC polymorphic GR group did negative maternal attitude predict fetal weight reduction, but not in the CT group, independent of confounders.",0
"[""Hence, the effects of maternal attitudes on fetal weight depend on the mother's polymorphism of GR gene.""]",0
None of the remaining GR polymorphism subgroups demonstrated any differential correlations between maternal attitudes and fetal weight (data not shown).,0
Discussion\nThe present study extends previous findings and provides evidence for the first time how maternal stress and GR polymorphisms can potentially affect fetal outcome together.,0
"As reviewed previously, prenatal maternal stress has been shown to have long-term effects on the psychological as well as behavioral development of the offspring [15,16].",0
"In our cohort, women with negative attitudes exhibited higher levels of stress during pregnancy compared to women with neutral/positive attitudes and gave birth to infants with lower birth weights than those with positive/neutral attitudes towards their pregnancy (500\u2009gr difference [13]).",0
"In terms of the polymorphisms analyses, only the maternal Tth111 I polymorphism was suggestive of a gene-environment interaction since, only in Tth111 I (CC), negative versus positive/neutral maternal attitudes towards the pregnancy predicted fetal weight reduction, but not in the Tth111 I (GC) group, independent of important confounders.",0
"[""These confounders included women's age and BMI and were not explained by gestational age.""]",0
"This is the first time that a gene-environment interaction between a GR polymorphism and maternal attitudes towards pregnancy was found, in relation to fetal weight.",0
To this date there has been some contradicting evidence as to the role of these polymorphisms in fetal outcomes [17–19].,0
"However, controversy surrounds the exact mechanisms by which these responses are regulated.",0
GR alternative splicing might also influence the subsequent activation of signalling pathways by glucocorticoids [20].,0
"In our study, we have shown that all known transcripts of GR splice variants are expressed in the human placenta with GR α being the predominant transcript in all categories studied.",0
These data corroborate a previous preliminary study of placental GRs [20].,0
"Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time the expression of GAS5 in human placentas.",0
We decided to incorporate GAS5 in the current study as it can act as a GR DNA binding decoy and as a result compromise its activity [8].,0
"Interestingly, GAS5 and GR α were the predominant transcripts in both term and preterm placentas.",0
"Here, we provide further information about the regulation of this transcript by cortisol using two in vitro models as it is upregulated by cortisol in a dose-independent manner.",0
This finding provides further evidence of regulation of GAS5 by stress and corroborates initial in vivo data in mice [21].,0
"In this study using C57BL/6 male mice, stress induced GAS5 RNA levels in the hippocampus and this increase was accompanied by a rise of corticosterone levels [22].",0
These in vitro and in vivo observations together are highly suggestive of a functional link between stress and this ncRNA.,0
"In view of previous data in HeLa cells, where GAS5 translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus with GR in response to dexamethasone [8], this colocalization is highly suggestive of a potential crosstalk at placental level between GAS5 and the GR.",0
"Preterm labor is associated with high mortality and morbidity [22] and a recent study pointed towards an association between maternal stress and complications of pregnancy, especially preterm birth [23].",0
"There is some controversy surrounding the exact function of GR β , but it appears to exert a dominant-negative effect on GR α -induced transcriptional activity [8].",0
GR γ is a ligand-dependent transcription factor with reduced transactivating activity and its function is still under investigation.,0
"Similarly, little is known about the role of GR-P, a truncated isoform that lacks a large part of the ligand-binding domain, including the domains for silencing of GR in the absence of hormone and transcriptional activation [24].",0
"In our study, an approximate 4-fold change in the GR α /GR-P in preterm labor was detected.",0
have shown that placental GR-P mRNA levels were reduced significantly after spontaneous labor [20].,0
A twofold increase in the GR α /GAS5 ratio was also noted in the preterm group compared with the term group of women.,0
It is attractive therefore to hypothesise that the change in the ratio of the splicing isoforms alters the responsiveness of placental GRs to cortisol and that this may affect gestational age.,0
"We would like to propose a potential model where, during preterm birth, GR α is the predominant receptor since there is a decrease in negative regulators such as GR β , GR γ , and the “pseudo-GRE” GAS5.",0
These ratio changes will ultimately lead to an augmented response towards glucocorticoids with potential detrimental effects for the mother and the fetus.,0
It is possible that this change of relative transcript abundance ratio might be involved in the correlation between negative maternal attitudes (hence highly stressed) and fetal birth weight.,0
"In terms of the polymorphic study, our study provides a novel insight into the involvement of GR polymorphisms in pregnancy outcome.",0
"We have identified a specific group of mothers (Tht III I polymorphism, CC group) in whom maternal attitudes predicted fetal weight.",0
"In a past study, a similar gene-environment interaction was noted between the ER22/23EK polymorphism and the effect of childhood adversity on depression [17].",0
"We acknowledge that measurement of GR polymorphisms posed certain limitations, for example, the use of cell lines as in vitro experimental models.",0
"Although both cell lines (JEG-3 and BeWo) could represent a cytotrophoblastic milieu in vitro , they have differences in their fusogenic capacities.",0
"In addition, microarray analyses demonstrated that many transcripts were differentially expressed between JEG-3 and BeWo cells [25].",0
It would be of interest to repeat these experiments in primary cell lines of syncytialised trophoblasts.,0
This experiment would provide a better insight into the regulation of GAS5 by cortisol.,0
"However and despite these limitations, there is a wealth of literature using those two cell lines as experimental models to study placental function.",0
It would also be of interest to expand these observations in human myometrium that is a key organ responsible for quiescence and contractility responses and also assess whether changes in GR transcripts are due to labor or nonlabor.,0
"To test this, we have performed qPCR for all GRs and GAS5 in the same cohort of placentas divided this time to labor ( n = 18) and nonlabor ( n = 5).",0
There was no apparent change in the expression of any of the genes in these two categories (data not shown).,0
"Therefore, at placental level, the contractile status does not really affect GR transcription.",0
We acknowledge that our sample included small numbers in certain categories of polymorphic groups.,0
"Moreover, the nature of maternal stress was not identified and further analytical approaches are needed to provide conclusive evidence for a gene-environment interaction.",0
"Nevertheless, the statistically significant effect and the size of differences observed between mothers with negative versus positive and neutral attitudes in the Tht111 I CC polymorphism group suggest that this effect may be robust.",0
"Second, the distribution of Bcl I polymorphism seen in this sample may be unique, since there are important geographical/ethnic differences in the prevalence of these polymorphisms.",0
"It should be emphasized that, in the present study, we included a fairly homogeneous cohort of Mediterranean patients from Crete.",0
"Despite these limitations, this is the first study to demonstrate a gene-maternal environment synergism in relation to infant birth weight, using a very brief assessment of maternal attitudes to pregnancy.",0
"Should these data be replicated in a much wider cohort, given the simplicity in assessing such attitudes and the feasibility to identify the homozygous group of women early on in pregnancy, these findings may have significant implications for public health and prevention.",0
"[""For example, based on the polymorphic profile and our brief assessment of mothers' attitude towards the pregnancy, we could screen noninvasively and identify mothers during pregnancy that may benefit from stress-management strategies, and this could possibly dramatically improve health outcomes for the mother as well as the fetus.""]",0
Body mass index is associated with the maternal lines but height is heritable across family lines in the Lifeways Cross-Generation Cohort Study\n\nAbstract\n\nObjectives\nOverweight and obesity is a problem in children in particular and determining pathways of transmission is important in prevention.,0
We aimed to examine associations for body mass index (BMI) across three generations of the same families.,0
"[""Results\nCorrelation of offspring's BMI with that of the mother increased with age (correlation coefficient 0.15 increasing to 0.28, p value <0.001 in all cases) while no consistent pattern was seen with offspring and fathers.""]",0
There was an association also with each parent and their own mother.,0
"[""Offspring's BMI was correlated to a lesser extent with that of the maternal grandmother while for girls only there was an association with that of the paternal grandmother at ages 0 and 5 (correlation coefficients 0.25, 0.28, p values 0.02, 0.01, respectively).""]",0
"In contrast, height of the child was strongly associated with those of all family members at age 5, but at birth and at age 9 only there was an association with those of the parents and the paternal grandfather.",0
"[""Correlation of offspring's height with those of the mother and father increased with age.""]",0
"Conclusions\nThe results suggest that BMI is predominantly associated with the maternal line, possibly either with intrauterine development, or inherited through the X chromosome, or both, while height is a more complex trait with genetic influences of the parents and that of the paternal grandfather predominating.",0
"[""Caption (BOXED-TEXT)\nStrengths and limitations of this study\nThis is one of the few studies to examine association between grandparents’ characteristics and grandchildren's growth across seven lineages and at three time points.""]",0
"The results of this study are novel, suggesting that body mass index is predominantly associated with maternal pathways, whether through intrauterine development or inherited through the X chromosome or both.",0
"The statistical analysis is novel, using mixed-model techniques that enable all the data to be utilised including incomplete families.",0
"A limitation is the relatively small numbers of respondents with differential response rates at each sweep, particularly when children averaged 9\u2005years of age.",0
A further limitation is the possibility that deceased grandparents would have different patterns of association with their grandchildren than those living.,0
Introduction\nIncreasing body mass index (BMI) and obesity levels in current populations are a source of concern for public health policy in many countries.,0
"There is significant interest in what influences weight gain over the life course and the degree to which risk of overweight or obesity is transmitted across generations of families.1–3From studies that have examined the heritability of BMI,45it is clear that BMI does have a heritable component.",0
"However, the majority of family studies of BMI examine relationships between two generations only and are not adjusted for cohort effects.",0
"Studies in which BMI of children is documented at repeated times show strong tracking patterns with age,6–9but this has not been reported in relation to family lineages including grandparents.",0
There are very few human studies which include three generations of family members and which also collect anthropometric data or study heritability patterns.,0
"[""The Genetics of Pre-eclampsia (GOPEC) consortium studied patterns of inheritance across three generations in relation to risk of pre-eclampsia.10A US study, employing self-reported grandparental data, looked at familial associations for childhood overweight.11In Hong Kong, an economy in epidemiological transition, grandparental and parental education in relation to childhood weight was studied, the parental influence being stronger.12A small number of studies have been reported which examine grandparental morbidity and mortality data in relation to infant birth weight and growth patterns.13–16Most recently, data from the Overkalix study in Sweden, which relates famine experience decades ago with current grandchildren's cardiovascular disease outcomes, suggest that the paternal grandmother's (PGM) exposure to famine-like conditions in childhood was associated with an increased likelihood of cardiovascular disease in her adult granddaughter, whereas the mortality association was limited to grandsons for the paternal grandfather (PGF).1718The maternal grandmother (MGM) may be particularly significant, because she supplies the ovum through the mother to her grandchild, as well as her nurturing role to the mother and grandchild.119Both grandmothers provide an intrauterine environment for the respective parents of any index grandchild.""]",0
"[""Anthropological studies also suggest the particular importance of the MGM for children's development.20\nThe Lifeways Cross-Generation Cohort Study was established in 2001 with the a priori purpose of assessing associations across generations and between family members.21–25We have shown in several previous analyses that there is a stronger association with children's outcomes along the maternal than the paternal line.23–25In the present study, we analyse patterns in BMI and height at three ages of the index child, employing primarily examination rather than self-reported data for adults.""]",0
Our purpose was to assess if there are any similarities in BMI patterns within families and whether similarities are constant over the three time points and across generations.,0
"In order to address difficulties with heritability interpretation, we have employed a mixed-model analysis that uses fixed and random effects.27The family component of variance is partitioned into variances of and correlations between family members.",0
"The baseline BMI at the younger age is included as a covariate to adjust for regression towards the mean.28In this analysis, it can be argued that effects on BMI common to both ages are cancelled and what remains are differential genetic effects, intrauterine effects and possibly environmental effects.",0
"BMI—child age 0\nIn the nuclear family, the correlation between the child and the mother was highly significant (table 4).",0
"When examined by gender, girls were only weakly correlated with the mother, but with boys the correlation was much stronger.",0
These data have a few girls whose mothers have a very high BMI and these values appear to dilute the correlation between girls and mother.,0
"For boys, the correlation with the MGM was significant.",0
"The PGM was significantly correlated with girls, but not boys, at age 0.",0
"BMI—child age 5\nThere was a strong correlation between the child and the mother, similar to that at age 0 (table 4).",0
The corresponding correlation between the child and the father was also significant overall.,0
"[""The child's BMI was also correlated with the MGM.""]",0
Girls were correlated with fathers but not mothers and were also correlated with the MGM and PGM.,0
Boys were correlated with mothers but not fathers (table 4).,0
"There was again a strong correlation of the child with the mother, this time being similar for boys and girls (table 4).",0
There was also a correlation with the MGM for both boys and girls.,0
Boys were also strongly correlated with the PGF at the age of 9 only.,0
The size of the correlation between the child and the mother at this age was similar to that between the mother and the MGM and the father and the PGM.,0
"For girls, there was a significant change with the BMI of the father, p=0.010, and a borderline significant change associated with the BMI of the PGM, p=0.066, but no association with other family members.",0
"For boys, there was a positive change associated with the BMI of the mother, p=0.002, but no association with other family members.",0
"In the analysis of change from age 5 to 9 (age 9–5), BMI change in girls was associated with the BMI of the mother, p=0.008.",0
"BMI change in boys was associated (with borderline significance) with the PGF, p=0.061.",0
"In general, BMI correlations of the child with the mother and MGM increased with age.",0
"[""Other familial associations for BMI\nThe mother's BMI was highly significantly correlated with that of her own mother p<0.001).""]",0
The same was seen for the father and his mother (p=0.008).,0
"Both the maternal and paternal grandparental couples had significant BMI associations (p=0.033 and p=0.013, respectively).",0
Height—child age 0\nThe child’s height/length was correlated with that of its mother and father and not with that of the other family members (table 5).,0
Correlations in the nuclear family were stronger for the girls and there was a borderline significant association of girls with MGM.,0
Height—child age 5\nThis correlation in the nuclear family became stronger at age 5.,0
"The height of the child was strongly correlated with that of the mother and father, being similar for boys and girls.",0
"The mother was correlated with the MGM and with the MGF, while the father was also correlated with his mother and father.",0
"The height of the child was correlated with the height of all family members including all four grandparents, with the strongest correlations being with the parents and the PGF.",0
The results for boys and girls were similar (table 5).,0
"Height—child age 9\nAs at age 5, the child’s height at age 9 was strongly correlated with that of the mother and father and PGF.",0
This was similar for boys and girls (table 5).,0
"However, the girl’s height was more strongly correlated with that of the mother than father.",0
"The size of the correlations, between the child and each parent at this age, was a little lower than those between the mother and her parents and the father and his parents.",0
"For girls, change in height at age 5–0 was correlated with the height of the mother, p<0.0001, and father, p=0.0003.",0
"For boys, change in height was correlated with the height of the mother, p<0.0001, and father, p<0.0001, borderline significance with MGM p=0.080, and with PGF p=0.009.",0
"For girls, change in height at age 9–5 was correlated with the height of the mother, p=0.008, and height of the father, p=0.031.",0
"For boys, the same change was only correlated with the height of the father, p=0.047.",0
"In general, height correlations of the child with each parent increased with age.",0
"Discussion\nThis highly novel cohort study is one of very few human studies in the literature with examination data across three generations and both lineages which can be linked to children’s growth patterns at three different time points.22To the best of our knowledge, there are no other reported human cross-generational data sets in the literature with four grandparental lines and three time points of measured BMI, so this is an original contribution to the scientific literature.",0
This is also highly topical currently.,0
"Wells, in a recent commentary, indicates the need for such cross-generational grandparental data to understand more fully the influence of maternal and paternal lineages on growth and development.19\nIn a previous study employing primarily self-reported data, we showed that BMI appeared to be strongly familial in the maternal line,23and we have shown that familial dietary patterns are also stronger in the maternal line.2425The present analysis of BMI has extended this to include both birth weight and data when the children were aged 9\u2005years and shows this strong maternal pattern consistently for children while height, by comparison, is heritable across lineages.",0
Similar patterns were seen across the generations for BMI and height.,0
"In our original publication, we used examination data at one time point only for the children when they were aged 5; we now report examination data at three separate time points, including a completely new sweep of data when children were aged 9.",0
"It cannot be assumed that in a growing child these relationships with family members would remain consistently the same, in that environmental factors would come more into play as the child grows up.29As children grow older in this study, the BMI relationship strengthens, presumably because of shared dietary environments, and to reinforce this, both grandparent couples also have significantly correlated BMI relationships.",0
This is therefore a novel analysis and a considerable expansion on the previous one.,0
"In the original paper, we used only self-reported height and weight data for all adults, whereas this time we are reporting examination data for mothers and grandparents.",0
"Not alone is this now more robust, but also it is a substantial scientific addition using novel data to build on our previous observation.",0
"[""In this cohort, we have collected detailed information on social and environmental influences on the child's development and in a number of other publications address this question, including cultural and familial influences.""]",0
"[""We have, for instance, established dietary associations between nuclear family members and have shown that maternal pregnancy diet is associated with a number of outcomes, including child's risk of asthma, overweight and obesity.22\nThere are powerful environmental influences at play in familial studies.""]",0
A report of the Young Finns Study followed offspring in relation to parental BMI from 3 to 18\u2005years and later again when children were 24–39\u2005years old.,0
"Maternal BMI was much more strongly associated with offspring BMI than that of father initially, but no differences in parental associations were seen when the offspring became adults.29\nWe approached this analysis looking for consistency and coherence of association as well as magnitude and statistical significance and include also the height analysis, which has the same numbers of respondents, to show that the absence of an association for BMI by comparison is not simply due to a power problem.",0
"While there are, for example, more mothers than fathers, there are relatively less grandparents, and yet both grandmothers do show statistically significant associations.",0
Ponderal index is the clinical measure normally used at birth.,0
"However, we are not seeking to report or measure adiposity in itself in this analysis; for comparator purposes, we report BMI at the three time points in order to compare like with like both (1) in relation to the child over time and (2) in relation to the adults.",0
"Cole et al ,30for instance, concluded that ponderal index was not appropriate for measuring intrauterine malnutrition.",0
"There were no correlations between BMI of the child of either sex at ages 0 and 5 with maternal or PGFs, so this evidence suggests that transmission of BMI is not primarily genetic.",0
BMI of boys was correlated with that of the MGM at two points but was not correlated with that of the PGM.,0
"For the girls, there was a weak correlation with the MGM but a stronger correlation with the PGM at ages 0 and 5.",0
"Thus, this suggests that BMI is not transmitted via mitochondrial DNA or, if so, only weakly.",0
"This leaves the intrauterine environment or genetic transmission on the sex chromosome with evidence suggesting the latter, since there are no correlations with the grandfathers or of boys with the PGM.",0
A recent study17found that female grandchildren have an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality if their PGM experienced a drastic change in food availability in their childhood.,0
"It indicated that X linked epigenetic inheritance via spermatozoa seemed to be plausible, with the transmission, limited to being through the father, possibly explained by the sex differences in the meiosis stage of cell reproduction.",0
A similar explanation is plausible in this study for BMI.,0
We are not basing our conclusion that the maternal line is stronger solely on the fact that the mother–child correlations at age 5 are significant.,0
"We do so based on the facts that the overall maternal–child relationships are significant at all three time points, that there are correlations between all three mother–child pairs, for example, mother–child, MGM–mother and PGM–father, and that, in contrast to height, where both lineages show significant associations, the pattern for BMI is primarily the maternal lineage.",0
"Intrauterine transmission must be considered important as the maternal relationship is consistent at all time points and between each mother–child pair, for example, the mother and her children, the mother and her own mother and the father and his mother.",0
"While there have been conflicting reports in the literature with, for instance, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)3reporting equivalent relationships between the child’s BMI and both parents, the Generation R study2reports that the maternal influence is strongest.",0
A large Norwegian study31has recently reported largely similar father–offspring and mother–offspring associations in adults across cardiovascular risk factors.,0
"However, in 9 of the 12 variables studied, age-standardised correlations were of a higher magnitude between mother and offspring, significantly so for height, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.",0
"As has been pointed out,119the relationship between the MGM in particular, her daughter and grandchild represents a 100\u2005years of nutritional flow, including intrauterine, genetic, mitochondrial and environmental nutritional pathways and these data illustrate this effect.",0
Morton et al 16indicate that population strategies aimed at optimising size at birth require intergenerational considerations for social as well as biological reasons.,0
"[""One key reason we conclude that intrauterine or X-mediated influences are important is because the grandmothers of both lineages, who do not share their grandchildren's direct daily environment, are each exerting an association.""]",0
Most studies do not have grandparental data from both lineages.,0
"[""The MGM could arguably have influenced her daughter's culinary and dietary habits and hence her grandchild's BMI,25but the PGM is associated with the paternal granddaughter and not her paternal grandson.""]",0
"It is entirely plausible that this is biologically mediated, and not purely environmental, as we posit, and was also reported in the Overkalix study.1718\nIn a meta-analysis of 26 family studies,5BMI heritability estimates ranging from 0.24 to 0.81 were reported.",0
Our correlation estimates (corresponding to half the heritability) of 0.25 between the mother and the MGM and 0.26 for the father and the PGM are consistent with these as is the value 0.28 for that of the child at age 9 with the mother.,0
The analysis5reported that heritability estimates rose by 0.012/year throughout childhood (age ≤18\u2005years) but decreased by −0.002/year in adulthood.,0
Our correlation estimates of 0.15 of the child at age 0 with the mother rising to 0.25 at age 9 and averaging at 0.25 in adulthood is consistent with this with the caveat that no change was seen between age 0 and 5.,0
Note that a similar pattern was not seen for offspring and fathers.,0
"Also note that, as in that analysis,5we found no difference in BMI heritability estimates between men and women.",0
"In contrast to BMI, height correlation estimates between the offspring and the mother are quite similar to those between the offspring and the father for each of the three child ages and each generation.",0
"The estimates increased rapidly from age 0 to 5 and then at a slower rate, reaching maximum values in adulthood.",0
The estimates are greater than those for BMI throughout.,0
Modern techniques for genetic analysis create opportunities for understanding the heritability of complex traits and risk for chronic diseases.2732Height is one of the more complex genetically inherited traits because as many as 20 genes—if not more—interact to determine a child’s height.,0
"Geneticists have found genes for height on the 7th, 8th and 20th chromosomes, as well as on the X chromosome.",0
"A recent report shows that combined common single-nucleotide polymorphisms explain a large proportion of the heritability for human height.33What is under-researched to date is the degree to which the X chromosome might be contributing to human obesity.34Unlike other authors,35we did not find heritability for postnatal length to be higher for maternal height than for paternal height.",0
"In our analysis, it was found that the child’s height was correlated with that of all family members at age 5, suggesting perhaps many genetic effects.",0
"Thus, the common estimate of heritability assuming additive genetic effects may not work for height.36However, at ages 0 and 9, height was primarily correlated in the nuclear family and similar correlations were observed for the parents with the grandparents.",0
"Interestingly, the height of the child continued at ages 5 and 9 to be strongly correlated with that of the PGF, not easily explainable by conventional genetic inheritance, though there may be a Y-related influence at play through the father, who himself is highly correlated with his father.",0
"This may be because reported data were exaggerated by the partner or because, for some reason, reported is a healthier group than measured height.",0
"For the small numbers of fathers we measured, there was a significantly lower height than in those we reported.",0
"However, the latter explanation is less likely since the two groups do not differ in weight or heights and weights of their partners—that is, the mother, or heights and lengths of child at age 0.",0
It is well known that male heights tend to be greater in reported than measured data.37Our analysis suggests that it is unlikely that correlations were affected by this feature.,0
"[""Probably the most familiar technique in estimating heritability is parent–offspring regression in which, for example, a trait's heritability can be estimated as the slope of the regression of offspring phenotype on mid-parent phenotype.""]",0
"It has been noted36that if the sexes are not equal in phenotypic variance, then regression of daughters on fathers, for example, must be adjusted for the difference in variation.",0
"Studies on children are likely to be over-representative of individuals from more recent birth years, but the separation of birth cohort and age effects on BMI correlation was possible in this study by including age-fixed and generation-fixed effects in the model.",0
"Our data do have limitations, as they are based on a relatively small-scale cohort with differential response rates at each sweep and the numbers of measured children at age 9 was considerably lower than in the previous sweeps.",0
We agree that caution is appropriate accordingly in data interpretation as the numbers at age 9 are smaller.,0
"In previous publications, we have reported on the representativeness of the participating mothers and children and find, as with many cohorts, that less affluent and younger mothers were less likely to continue to participate, but the baseline maternal BMI does not differ between responders and non-responders.22Also, we only report statistically significant findings which by definition are sufficiently powered when the child is aged 9.",0
"There may be some self-selection bias in relation to participating grandparents, as clearly grandparents who were deceased could not participate.26In previous analyses, we have shown that the original index mothers were representative of the general population,22and our findings were consistent across the three sweeps, so we do not think self-selection can be the main explanatory factor for our findings.",0
"In conclusion, this novel cohort study shows clear familial associations across three generations for height in both lineages, but the BMI pattern is stronger in the maternal line.",0
"Dose-Response Effects of the Text4baby Mobile Health Program: Randomized Controlled Trial\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nMobile health (mHealth) is growing rapidly, but more studies are needed on how to optimize programs, including optimal timing of messaging, dose of exposure, and value of interactive features.",0
This study evaluates final outcomes of text4baby (a text message service for pregnant and postpartum women) from a randomized trial performed in a population of pregnant female soldiers and family members.,0
Objective\nThe study aims were to evaluate (1) treatment effects and (2) dose-response effects of text4baby on behavioral outcomes compared to control (no text4baby) condition.,0
We examined treatment effects and the effects of higher doses of text4baby messages on outcomes.,0
"The main finding was a significant effect of high exposure to text4baby on self-reported alcohol consumption postpartum (OR 0.212, 95% CI 0.046-0.973, P =.046), as measured by the question “Since you found out about your pregnancy, have you consumed alcoholic beverages?” The text4baby participants also reported lower quantities of alcohol consumed postpartum.",0
Conclusions\nStudies of text4baby have helped to build the mHealth evidence base.,0
The effects of text4baby offer lessons for future scalable mHealth programs and suggest the need to study dose-response effects of these interventions.,0
"Introduction\nMobile health (mHealth), the use of mobile phones as a tool for health care treatment and public health behavior change, is a rapidly expanding field that has significant promise to improve public health and increase the effectiveness of disease prevention and health promotion programs [1-3].",0
Mobile phones are poised to be powerful tools to promote health in a number of domains and settings worldwide [4].,0
"In particular, mHealth programs have proven effective in drug adherence, as patient reminder systems, and in some areas of areas of chronic disease management, prevention, and control [5,6].",0
"Some of the best mHealth evidence comes from smoking cessation studies [9,10].",0
Free and colleagues [11] systematically reviewed the evidence on mHealth interventions and found that antiretroviral treatment (ART) and smoking cessation interventions had sufficient evidence of effectiveness to be considered for inclusion in health care services.,0
The authors noted that the ART and smoking cessation studies exhibited no evidence of bias and had significant effects on reduced viral load (ART) and biochemically validated smoking cessation [11].,0
"Abroms and colleagues designed and evaluated the text2quit intervention, which delivers text messages using a tailored feedback approach to promote smoking cessation, and found that 11.1% of former smokers who participated in the intervention remained abstinent after 6 months compared to 5.0% among the comparison group [12].",0
Whitaker and colleagues [13] specifically reviewed mobile phone-based cessation interventions and found them to be effective in long-term quitting outcomes.,0
"Although the evidence from mobile phone studies is less conclusive in these areas, preliminary research has shown promise in delivering healthy eating and active living (HEAL) interventions.",0
"Patrick and colleagues [14] found that, compared to control, short message service (SMS) text messaging and multimedia message service (MMS) participants achieved 1.97 kg greater weight loss.",0
A follow-up study among overweight men also found higher weight loss using Internet and mobile phone [15].,0
Hurling and colleagues [16] found that an Internet and mHealth intervention among overweight adults that included reminders produced more than 2 hours more physical activity (PA) per week compared to adults with no access.,0
Joo and colleagues [17] found that weekly text messages about diet and PA behavior promoted weight loss.,0
"Additionally, there have been studies that used combinations of mobile phone and other new technologies for weight control and found positive effects [18].",0
A study of postpartum women employed a team approach to encourage women to use a Facebook app to promote PA [19].,0
"Additionally, there is growing evidence that mHealth programs are effective in promoting diabetes self-management [20], as treatment adherence tools, and as reminder systems for health behavior and treatment [11].",0
"Although the evidence for use of mobile phones beyond these areas is still emerging, the overall trend is that they can be effective tools for health promotion, disease prevention, and as adjunct treatment tools.",0
"Interventions using mobile phones are growing worldwide, and some are achieving significant scale and population-level reach.",0
"As reported by the United Nations Foundation, Project Masiluleke in South Africa reaches 1 million people each day via mobile phone with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention, testing, and treatment information [21].",0
"Although the literature from rigorous studies of smoking cessation, treatment adherence, and some other chronic disease prevention and management studies show that mHealth programs can promote behavior change, more randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed [11].",0
"There is also a need for more studies on what specific features and approaches in mHealth programs are most effective, including studies on the optimal timing of messaging, dose of exposure, and value of interactive feature [23].",0
It represents one of the largest mHealth text-based programs developed to date.,0
"Recent studies of the text4baby program have found that it changes attitudes and beliefs, but effects on behavior have not previously been established [23,26].",0
The text4baby program also offers an example of using behavioral theory to the design mHealth interventions [1].,0
"The program applies and adapts Social Cognitive Theory, the Health Belief Model, and Diffusion of Innovation theory [27-29].",0
"Future mHealth interventions may build on these lessons to engage audiences in health programs through multiple digital channels [31,32].",0
Female service members and spouses of active duty soldiers are a group exposed to multiple stressors that may increase health risks during pregnancy [33-35].,0
"These soldiers and family members could benefit significantly from mHealth programs such as text4baby because it is a free resource and is highly portable, permitting families to receive these messages anywhere in the world where text messages can be received.",0
The present study evaluates the final outcomes of text4baby from a randomized trial of pregnant female soldiers and family members [23].,0
The study tested 2 primary hypotheses: (1) text4baby group participants would demonstrate increased health-promoting behaviors and decreased risk behaviors compared to control at postpartum follow-up and (2) text4baby participants would demonstrate a dose-response effect of receiving the text messages in which higher doses of text messages would produce greater behavioral outcomes.,0
Previous interventions to promote reproductive health care utilization among low- and middle-income women suggested an approximate 12% effect (intervention vs control) of such programs after a 12-month time period [38].,0
Power analysis estimated the required sample to be 996 participants in total assuming a 10% attrition rate at postpartum follow-up.,0
"Also, intervention exposure, as measured by estimated number of antepartum messages delivered and number of antepartum days enrolled in the messaging campaign, were assessed for all study participants in the intervention group.",0
"Based on the distribution of messages, investigators examined estimated dosage levels, dichotomized on whether a participant received lower or higher than median message exposure to messaging.",0
"Exposure was measured by an estimated count of total messages delivered to participants based on service enrollment and end dates validated by the Voxiva text4baby service database, which were linked to individuals and provided to the investigators under the DUA.",0
Investigators estimated the odds of change over time in response to each of the behavioral outcome variables as a function of text4baby text message exposure through use of an interaction term including program exposure and progression to follow-up measurement.,0
"Therefore, a multiple imputation model was constructed to account for missing race and marital status through use of a logit function with parity, age, and treatment status as predictors of both race and marital status.",0
"Following widely accepted practice, Cronbach alpha of .6 was used to confirm interitem agreement for use of the factor in descriptive and regression analyses [39].",0
"However, GEE models using the KAB factor did not show significant results and have not included those data.",0
"The comparison revealed a larger, statistically significant percent reporting smoking in the last 30 days: 15.3% (95% CI 12.08-18.58) in the control vs 9.6% (95% CI 6.95-12.32, P= .048) in the treatment group, respectively.",0
We identified the week of pregnancy in which participants enrolled using the assumption of a 40-week gestation period and subtracting the total number of days between the participant’s date of enrollment and due date recorded by the study site.,0
"In these models, we examined the effects of high vs low dosage of text4baby, as measured by a median split variable in which the top 50% of the distribution of text message exposure among text4baby intervention participants was compared to the bottom half among that same group.",0
"In these models, we found a significant effect of text4baby on self-reported alcohol consumption postpartum (OR 0.212, 95% CI 0.046-0.973, P =.046), as measured by the question “Since you found out about your pregnancy, have you consumed alcoholic beverages?” The lower OR indicates lower odds of consuming alcoholic beverages at postpartum follow-up.",0
"However, of the 128 respondents who indicated zero drinks per day, only 51 (40%) of them were in the control group and 77 (60%) in text4baby.",0
"Discussion\nThe text4baby program is significant in that it represents one of the largest worldwide mHealth programs to date, with more than 800,000 enrollees from inception in February 2010 through November 2014 [40].",0
"To date, there have been very few large-scale mHealth programs shown to be effective.",0
The future of mHealth will include going beyond small-scale pilots and trials and reaching population-level effects through large-scale implementation.,0
"First, it provides a randomized trial of text4baby with a large sample over the full course of the prenatal texting module.",0
The Madigan study was ambitious in that it followed a baseline sample of nearly 1000 women for a total study period of nearly 2 years.,0
"Second, it provides one of the most comprehensive studies to date evaluating the effect of mHealth on the health of pregnant military female soldiers and family members.",0
"As noted, military women’s health is an understudied topic and the multiple stressors that they face compared to civilian women suggest that it deserves greater attention from mHealth and other health studies [34,41].",0
"Third, the study demonstrates a behavioral effect of text4baby among high-exposure users.",0
"Previous studies demonstrated short-term effects on KAB among participants, including the initial outcomes of the Madigan study [23,26].",0
"However, until these results, no behavioral effects had been observed.",0
"We found that among the subgroup of high-exposure participants, text4baby had a positive effect on reducing alcohol use behavior of pregnant and postpartum women.",0
"Specifically, we disconfirmed our first hypothesis that there was no direct treatment effect of text4baby.",0
The GEE models to estimate treatment effects on measured outcomes did not demonstrate any significant postpartum text4baby participation effects on health-promoting behaviors.,0
"However, we confirmed our second hypothesis that there was a dose-response effect of text4baby, with higher levels of text message exposure predicting lower self-reported alcohol consumption.",0
"This was an important focus of text4baby messages, including both recommendations not to drink and also warnings about the health risks of fetal alcohol syndrome for unborn babies.",0
Our results show that dosage was a predictor of lower alcohol consumption response.,0
"Although self-reported alcohol consumption would be expected to be lower after pregnancy given social cues and available information about health risks for all participants, the dose-response effect among text4baby participants was pronounced, as high-dose participants were more than twice as likely to abstain from drinking compared to low-dose participants.",0
"The brief, text-based intervention format of text4baby is consistent with other brief prenatal alcohol interventions found to be effective in recent studies [42].",0
"Moreover, descriptive analysis showed that the quantity of drinking was lower among text4baby participants postpartum.",0
"Although this is not a large number of total messages, it is worth noting that they reinforce information women are already receiving from other sources regarding avoiding alcohol use.",0
"These data suggest that dosage of texts received regarding risks of alcohol use, which included messages regarding risks due to alcohol while breastfeeding, had a cumulative effective.",0
There are several implications of the Madigan study and text4baby for future mHealth interventions and research.,0
"The program addresses a wide range of health topics, as compared to other studies that focused on 1 or a few closely related health behaviors.",0
"However, initial short-term findings demonstrated multiple KAB effects [23], and this study demonstrated a behavioral effect on alcohol use.",0
"Broad, low-touch interventions can be effective and given low participant burden should be considered as scalable program options.",0
There is a need to understand optimal levels of dosage and other factors that affect mHealth intervention outcomes.,0
It is important to recognize that many individuals who use text messages receive large numbers of texts per day.,0
"We did not have measures of total texts or potentially competing messages received by participants in this study, and those are important topics for future research.",0
"Delivering high doses of mHealth interventions has implications in terms of cost, participant burden, and potential “wear out” effects (ie, overexposure).",0
"Thus, identifying optimal mHealth dosages could have potential major benefits for future programs in terms of cost effectiveness and outcomes.",0
"Although this study does not indicate an optimal dose, it suggests the need to understand dosage thresholds and delivery methods.",0
Future research should include more discrete and refined dosage and other optimization studies.,0
"For example, studies have examined point-of-decision prompts to increase exercise and nutrition [43], and use of mobile technologies for health interventions [11,44], but no study has combined both.",0
Text messaging interventions can do much more than simply deliver text reminders—they can deliver right into the hands of highly targeted population the public service announcements that in years past would have appeared in mass media [45].,0
"Future interventions can tailor text message and other mHealth message content (eg, through social media or apps) both to a specific target audience and to an optimal time for delivery.",0
"By getting messages to a specific population group when they are at risk of engaging in unhealthy behavior (eg, teens watching TV, being exposed to junk food advertising, being sedentary and snacking at times such as after school or on weekends), interventions can influence them at the optimal time [46,47].",0
There are 2 important limitations of this study.,0
"First, we had a low follow-up rate and, thus, used imputation techniques to support the analysis.",0
"As a result, the study may be underpowered.",0
"Despite this fact, the overall direction of results was consistent with previous text4baby studies and additionally we found a behavioral effect.",0
"Much of the attrition was attributable to redeployments and, thus, lack of access to participants at the Madigan clinic.",0
"Second, although we observed dosage effects, we are only able to conclude that higher levels of text messages had an effect on alcohol use.",0
This leaves the important question of exact dosage and timing of delivery requirements for future studies.,0
Studies of text4baby have helped establish and expand the mHealth evidence base.,0
"The demonstrated KAB and behavioral effects of this broad, low-touch program offers lessons for future scalable mHealth efforts.",0
The dose-response effects observed here suggest the need to study methods to evaluate exposure and achieve optimal dosage effects in future research.,0
"Program dosage and optimization research should be included to address other features of the mobile phone, such as ubiquity, constant use, and potential to act as a point of decision prompt.",0
"Prenatal Vitamin Use and Vitamin D Status during Pregnancy, Differences by Race and Overweight Status\n\nAbstract\n\nObjective\nWe aimed to study whether prenatal vitamin (PNV) use protects against low 25(OH)D levels in all women and particularly in obese and black women who are both at risk of vitamin D deficiency and poor pregnancy outcomes.",0
We used multivariable logistic regression to analyze associations of PNV use and odds of vitamin D deficiency defined as 25(OH)D levels < 50 nmol/L.,0
"PNV use among black women was not associated with vitamin D deficiency (adjusted OR 1.0, 95%CI 0.4, 2.3) but was among white women (3.5, 95%CI 2.1, 5.8)(Interaction P<0.01).",0
Conclusions\nOngoing trials of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy should consider potential effect modification by race/ethnicity.,0
"Introduction\nPerinatal health outcomes vary dramatically by race in the United States.1African American women develop preeclampsia more often than their white counterparts2and are more likely to develop preterm labor.3The result is that black infants are 60% more likely be preterm and four times more likely to die due to prematurity than white infants.1Because of less efficient vitamin D synthesis in the skin of darker pigmented individuals, African Americans are at higher risk than white Americans of vitamin D deficiency.4,5Black women are also more likely than white women to be overweight or obese6which is of concern because obesity is another risk factor for vitamin D deficiency5,7and poor perinatal outcomes.8In observational studies, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels have been shown to be associated with higher risk of several adverse perinatal outcomes including gestational diabetes9,10, preeclampsia,11preterm birth12and small-for-gestational age status.13,14,15,16,17Because of the paucity of vitamin D trial data with respect to perinatal outcomes, whether differences in vitamin D status during pregnancy explains or partially explains perinatal disparities is plausible18but remains unknown.",0
"Furthermore, while multivitamin intake has been shown to vary by race,19it remains unknown whether multivitamin intake improves vitamin D status among the highest risk groups (African Americans and overweight/obese) during pregnancy.",0
The object of this study was to examine whether women who reported taking a prenatal vitamin had lower risk of low 25(OH)D levels.,0
Our hypothesis was that lack of prenatal vitamin (PNV) use would be associated with vitamin D deficiency (defined as <50 nmol/).,0
"We defined vitamin D deficiency as <50 nmol/L, a common cut-point in the literature.5,22,23\n\nStatistical analyses\nFirst, we analyzed bivariate associations between 25(OH)D category and PNV use as well as covariates including maternal age, race/ethnicity, smoking, education and BMI.",0
Women with missing covariates were not included in final multivariable models.,0
"Older, white, lean and better educated women were more likely to report PNV use (Table 1).",0
"In unadjusted bivariate analyses, black women, overweight/obese women, less educated women, and younger women were more likely to have low 25(OH)D levels (Table 2).",0
"Further adjustment for maternal age, education, smoking status, BMI and race/ethnicity race/ethnicity attenuated these estimates but women reporting no PNV use still had significantly higher odds of 25(OH)D levels<50 (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.5, 3.0).",0
"In other words, early PNV use was associated with vitamin D sufficiency earlier in pregnancy but not later in pregnancy (Table 4).",0
"Because we were concerned that ever-users included a heterogeneous category of PNV users including women who only used before pregnancy or only after pregnancy diagnosis, we compared this estimate to an analogous model comparing women who used both before and after pregnancy diagnosis (always users, n=477) to never users (n=256).",0
"When then we stratified by overweight/obesity status, we found that among women with BMI >25 kg/m2 lack of PNV use was associated with higher odds of 25(OH)D levels <50 nmol/L during the first trimester(seasonally-adjusted OR 4.1, 95% CI 2.7, 6.3)and later in pregnancy (OR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.6, 3.7).",0
"Among women with BMI < 25 kg/m2, lack of PNV use was associated with higher odds of 25(OH)D levels <50 nmol/L during the first trimester (seasonally adjusted OR 3.0, 95% CI: 1.9, 4.8), but not at the later time point (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.9, 2.3).",0
"When we stratified by race/ethnicity status, we found that for black women, lack of PNV use was not associated with significantly higher seasonally-adjusted odds of 25(OH)D levels <50 nmol/L early in pregnancy (OR 1.0 (0.4, 2.3) (Table 3).",0
"In contrast for white women, lack of PNV use was associated with significantly higher seasonally-adjusted odds of 25(OH)D levels <50 nmol/L early (OR 3.5, 95% CI 2.1, 5.8) (Interaction P value 0.01).",0
"Discussion\nOur data suggest that while prenatal PNV use is associated with lower odds of vitamin D deficiency, the association is not uniform.",0
Both overweight/obesity as well as darker skin pigmentation are both well-established risk factors for vitamin D deficiency.,0
"While lack of PNV use among overweight/obese pregnant women was associated with higher odds of low 25(OH)D levels, this was not the case for black women, who were less likely to take PNV’s compared to white women.",0
Our data are consistent with other similar cohort data.,0
"In another study of Massachusetts women, black women reported taking periconceptional multivitamins half as often as white women.19Additionally, our prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is similar to that reported in NHANES24and in another Boston cohort, Project Viva.13,25Others have analyzed the association between PNV use and vitamin D status.",0
"Shea et al studied 2500 elderly adults and found that lack of PNV use was associated with higher odds of vitamin D insufficiency (<75 nmol/L) in both black (5.2 (95% CI: 3.5, 7.7)) and white participants (OR 2.6, 95% CI: 2.0, 3.2), however these subjects were much older and not pregnant.26A small Turkish study of 79 pregnant women showed significantly higher 25(OH)D levels among women reporting PNV use in the third trimester,27but this study did not include women of African descent and did not have the power to address potential interaction by BMI.",0
"Similarly Holmes et al reported higher 25(OH)D levels among pregnant women taking PNV in a longitudinal study, but only included Caucasian women.23\nOur study has several strengths including 25(OH)D concentrations at two separate time points, self-reported race/ethnicity, and measured height and weight during the first trimester and weight at subsequent visits.",0
Our study has limitations associated with self-report of PNV use which could differ from actual use.,0
"Additionally we lacked data on sun exposure, actual skin pigmentation or food intake which contribute to 25(OH)D concentration.",0
"However, our data remain relevant because PNV use is likely to be more modifiable than latitude of residence, skin pigmentation, sun exposure which should be limited due to skin cancer risk, or even dietary patterns which can be difficult to change.",0
Our study is also limited by lack of detailed data about PNV use.,0
"We had no information as to the duration of use or the vitamin D dose in the PNV which typically is 400–600 IU per tablet, but can vary.",0
We did not have data on whether women were taking separate calcium or vitamin D supplements beyond what is contained in PNVs.,0
We also had no information on frequency of use which could have varied from daily to sparse use.,0
Our findings could be affected by unmeasured or inadequately measured confounding variables such as socioeconomic status which could vary by weight and race and could possibly affect self-report of PNV use.,0
We also lacked data on vitamin D binding protein which may differ by race/ethnicity and could affect the association between PNV use and 25(OH)D measured in the plasma.,0
"The optimal method of vitamin D measurement remains controversial, but our laboratory uses U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology level 1 and this method is commonly used clinically and in the literature.",0
"Lastly, we are not suggesting the futility of PNV use in black women.",0
"In contrast, our data support investigation into higher doses of vitamin D in subgroups at high risk if benefits are demonstrated by ongoing trials in pregnancy of achieving higher 25(OH)D levels.",0
Future analyses of health effects of vitamin D status in this population are planned but beyond the scope of this analysis.,0
"In conclusion, we found that lack of PNV use during pregnancy was associated with vitamin D deficiency early in pregnancy, but not among black women.",0
"In light of two recent meta-analyses/systematic reviews concluding that low 25(OH)D levels during pregnancy are associated with several morbidities in pregnancy15,16, optimizing vitamin D status during pregnancy may be important.",0
Ongoing trials of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy should consider effect modification by race/ethnicity.,0
The Role of Vitamin D in Reproductive Health—A Trojan Horse or the Golden Fleece?,0
"Abstract\nIn the last decade, vitamin D was in the spotlight in many fields of research.",0
"Despite numerous publications, its influence on reproductive health remains ambiguous.",0
This paper presents an up-to-date review of current knowledge concerning the role of cholecalciferol in human reproduction.,0
"Vitamin D deficiency, defined as serum concentration of 25-hydroxycalciferol of less than 50 nmol/L, is commonly noted more frequently than only in fertility clinic patients.",0
It is a global trend that is observed in all age groups.,0
"Most experts agree that vitamin D supplementation is a necessity, particularly in women suffering from obesity, insulin resistance or small ovarian reserve, as well as in men with oligo- and asthenozoospermia if serum concentration should fall below 50 nmol/L (normal range up to 125 nmol/L).",0
High concentration of vitamin D and its metabolites in decidua during the 1st trimester suggests its important role in the implantation process and a local immunological embryo-protection.,0
"On the other hand, evidence-based research did not prove a significant difference so far in ovulation stimulation or embryo development depending on vitamin D level.",0
"In one of the publications, it was also found that vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) has a molecular similarity to anti-sperm antibodies, and another one concluded that both low (<50 nmol/L) and high (>125 nmol/L) concentration of vitamin D are associated with decreased number and quality of spermatozoa in semen.",0
"Vitamin D is definitely not a Trojan Horse in reproductive health, since there were no adverse effects reported for vitamin D intake of up to 10,000 IU/day, but to proclaim it the Golden Fleece, more evidence is needed.",0
"Introduction\nThe role of vitamin D in fertility treatment has been recently described in some comprehensive reports [1,2].",0
"Numerous publications proclaim this particle a panacea for various mental and somatic chronic diseases, while other advise caution in prescribing it to some groups of patients.",0
What is the role of cholecalciferol in human reproduction?,0
"Should its supplementation become a golden standard in fertility treatment, or do we still need more evidence on its effect?",0
"Today we know that, in a healthy woman, vitamin D serum concentration is higher than in patients suffering from polycystic ovaries syndrome (PCOS).",0
"Vitamin D activity pathways in patients with PCOS remain unknown, but cholecalciferol supplementation improves their insulin resistance and the effects of infertility treatment.",0
"Vitamin D stimulates anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) production as well, which is highly correlated with ovarian reserve preservation.",0
"Likewise, in patients with vitamin D deficiency, a higher occurrence of uterine myomas is observed—another established reason for infertility.",0
"Moreover, it was found that a high concentration of calcidiol is related to greater endometriosis incidence, which was explained by diminishing elimination of endometrial cells that pass to the peritoneal cavity via ovarian reflux.",0
"Like females, male low (<50 nmol/L) and high (>125 nmol/L) vitamin D serum concentrations decrease not only spermatozoa count but also their progressive movement as well as increasing morphology abnormalities.",0
"Therefore, a clinician must be careful when prescribing vitamin D preparations, especially in male patients.",0
"Background: Since classical development of medicine in 1920, Vitamin D (cholecalciferol, VD) was strongly associated with rickets, after observation that cod liver consumption leads to a regression in rickets symptoms [3].",0
"However, in developing countries, it is still a common problem in the pediatric population [4,5].",0
"Currently, researchers are attempting to reveal the non-classical influence of cholecalciferol on health.",0
"Lower vitamin D levels have been found in many autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, autoimmune thyroid diseases [6,7].",0
"Since 2013, the database of the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health (PubMed) has gained 2050 new publications about vitamin D and contains 62,427 articles regarding this subject.",0
"Research on the role of vitamin D in reproduction process modulation seems especially interesting; their conclusions presumably have a significant practical meaning in infertility treatment, a serious medical problem affecting up to 53 million people worldwide [8].",0
"For the time being, we know that vitamin D exists in two forms: vitamin D2(ergocalciferol) and D3(cholecalciferol).",0
"An optimal level of vitamin D concentration in blood serum should range between 50 and 125 nmol/L [10], even though some environmental studies imply that the target level should be set much higher—up to 250, or even at 300 nmol/L [11,12].",0
"The effect of vitamin D on ovarian granulosa cells responsible for steroidogenesis, as well as on immune system regulation, was established after finding 1-α-hydroxylase and VDR receptors in deciduae, placentas, ovaries, endometriums and pituitary glands, and was confirmed in vitro by demonstrating active metabolites of vitamin D such as 1,25[OH]2D and 24,25[OH]2D in mentioned tissues [14,15,16,17,18].",0
"It is known that 1,25[OH]2D is responsible for increasing intracellular Ca+2concentration and the activity of acrosine, which is accountable for acrosome reactions that are essential for the fertilization process.",0
"An active form of 1-α-hydroxylase in sperm proves the existence of local synthesis of cholecalciferol and strongly suggests its paracrine effect on spermatogenesis as described inFigure 1[19,20].",0
Methods\nThis article presents an up-to-date review of publications describing the function of cholecalciferol in reproduction and its place in infertility treatment.,0
"Many of them contradict each other, or are at least incoherent.",0
"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome\nPCOS is the most often diagnosed endocrinological disorder in women in their reproductive period, affecting 15%–20% of population, according to the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology standards [21].",0
"Other commonly used guidelines are Rotterdam and Androgen Access Society criteria [22,23].",0
PCOS is very heterogonous and it is often impossible to determine the cause-effect relation between clinical symptoms and biochemical disorders [24].,0
"Since our previous review [2], two new original papers have been published, explaining the significance of vitamin D in PCOS pathogenesis.",0
"They suggest that VD changes AMH production patterns in ovarian granulose cells and alters follicle stimulating hormone (FHS) sensitivity, possibly playing a role in ovarian follicle development.",0
"In healthy controls, 25[OH] D has shown to be positively correlated with AMH status, presenting seasonal variance [25].",0
"In the second piece of research, VD supplementation was proven to increase serum levels of pro-inflammatory advanced glycation end products receptor (sRAGE), a particle binding those glycation end products (AGEs), which are known to be one of PCOS triggers ( p = 0.03).",0
"At the same time, it decreases serum AMH levels ( p< 0.001), which are often elevated in those women [26].",0
"AMH level reduction and an increase of circulating sRAGE after VD3exerted an anti-inflammatory action, which may lead to improved folliculogenesis in PCOS patients.",0
"VD serum levels are inversely proportional to blood pressure, lipid levels, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome symptoms in PCOS patients [27,28,29,30].Figure 2shows how VD deficiency, together with obesity, may increase insulin resistance and deplete glucose transport through cellular walls—VD stimulates insulin receptor expression and insulin secretion [31].",0
"In infertility studies, VD level was described as a predictor for ovulation stimulation success with the use of clomiphene citrate (CC).",0
"An unequivocal positive correlation was stated between VD3level and the development of functional ovarian follicles, percentage of pregnancies, as well as proper body mass index (BMI) [28].",0
"Another study demonstrated that, in obese women, the concentration of VD was considerably lower in patients with PCOS, which may prove its role in PCOS development [32].",0
"In the light of provided evidence, VD supplementation was incorporated in the schemes of PCOS treatment.",0
Uterine Myomas\nLast year gave us a new insight on VD-related gene polymorphism and the risk of uterine myomas (UM).,0
It was earlier observed that lower concentration of VD is typical for women with fibroids (44.9 ± 19.2 vs .,0
It has long been known that African Americans are two to three times more prone to myomas than European Americans.,0
This is concomitant with observational data showing that mean 25[OH] D concentrations in African Americans are near 40 nmol/L compared to about 65 nmol/L for white Americans [34].,0
A recent study on gene polymorphism in 2232 postmenopausal women has proven that two single nucleotide polymorphisms are significantly associated with UM.,0
"Gene rs12800438 is correlated with higher serum 25[OH] D levels, and gene rs6058017 - with lighter skin pigmentation [35].",0
"Currently conducted animal studies provide data on probable therapeutic use of paricalcitol, a VD3analog with lower calcemic activity, in uterine fibroid treatment [36].",0
"So far, no human studies have been published concerning this compound, and ulipristal acetate remains our main weapon against UM.",0
"Endometriosis\nA paper published last year, entitled: “1-alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 regresses endometriotic implants in rats by inhibiting neovascularization and altering regulation of matrix metalloproteinase” sets a new direction in VD research [37].",0
"Up to this moment, researchers were focused on immunomodulating effect of vitamin D on endometriosis.",0
It was confirmed that abnormally high VD concentration causes impaired elimination of endometrium cells passing to the peritoneal cavity via ovarian reflux [38].,0
Those two publications only seemingly contradict each other.,0
"An increased calcidiol level increases the risk of endometriosis occurrence, but in already existing cysts, it is a powerful inhibitor of neovascularization.",0
"No matter which angle we choose to look at for endometriosis, it is a disease caused by metabolic and biochemical imbalance.",0
"Therefore, determining VD status of those patients is so important.",0
This complicated relationship is well described in some recent review publications [40].,0
"Premature Ovarian Failure\nPremature ovarian failure, defined as starting the menopausal period before the 40th year of life, can also be influenced by VD level.",0
"Except for the age factor, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is well recognized as the biochemical marker of this syndrome [41].",0
"AMH is produced by ovary granulosa cells irrespective of stimulation with gonadotropins, but, as stated above, it may be triggered by VD supplementation.",0
It is responsible for the stimulation of primary follicles in the ovaries and their susceptibility to FSH.,0
"In assisted reproduction, it is widely used as a parameter of ovarian reserve [43].",0
"In linear regression analysis serum, vitamin D level positively correlated with total testosterone ( p< 0.001) and free androgen index ( p< 0.001).",0
Authors suggest that VD may increase fertility through the modulation of androgen activity [44].,0
The direct effect of vitamin D on AMH level and follicle development was also confirmed in a recently published in vitro experiment [45].,0
The correlation between VD and AMH was confirmed in a multi-center study in patients over their 40th years of life.,0
"The authors of the study suggest a direct effect of vitamin D on AMH production, and thus longer maintenance of ovarian reserve in the patients with its higher concentration [46].",0
Male Infertility Factor\nShould males visiting infertility clinics be treated with VD preparations?,0
The critical review of the available literature does not provide a consistent answer to this question.,0
"Recent animal studies proved that sperm count, motility, histological structure of testis, and spermatogenesis are more dependent on proper serum calcium and phosphorus levels rather than VD status [47].",0
"Authors state that the proliferation of spermatogenic cells was decreased with calcium-dependent down regulation of cyclin E and CDK2, and up regulation of p53 and p21 expression, which is not a direct effect of active vitamin D deficiency.",0
Similar results have been reported in human subjects.,0
"According to a study on 300 men, Bloomberg concluded that 1,25(OH)D3increased intracellular calcium concentration and sperm motility and induced the acrosome reaction in mature spermatozoa.",0
"VD serum levels were positively associated with sperm motility [48,49].",0
"Earlier research suggested the adverse effect of vitamin D on fertility after a discovery of a molecular similarity of its transporting protein, the vitamin D binding protein (VDBP), to anti-sperm antibodies.",0
"Luckily, for the time being the in vitro experiments did not prove cross-reaction of specific immunoglobulin with VDBP [50].",0
Fertility cannot be the only concern of a physician consulting male patients.,0
"Infertile males with oligo-, astheno-, terato- and normospermia present a higher risk of osteoporosis and have lower bone mineral density (BMD) proportionally to testosterone and VD concentration ( p< 0.01) in comparison with healthy controls at the same age.",0
Significantly lower serum testosterone concentration is associated with lower BMD measured densitometrically in the lumbar spine and iliac bone ( p< 0.05).,0
"A strong, positive correlation between the concentration of VD and sperm motility and morphology was also found ( p< 0.05).",0
"According to the recent studies [47], we can suggest that it was not a result of direct VD action, but its role in ion homeostasis [51].",0
The correlation between testosterone and VD has not been observed yet in another study conducted in Denmark on 307 fertile men.,0
The lower serum VD level was also related to worse sperm parameters [52].,0
Another study describes what we have already learned from the paragraph on endometriosis.,0
"A study on hormonal factors in 147 males, selected from 170 volunteers, homogenous according to age (29 ± 8.5 years), BMI (24.3 ± 3.2) and stimulants intake demonstrated an abnormal (both low (<50 nmol/L) and high (>125 nmol/L) concentration of VD which negatively affected the sperm count, motility and morphology [53].",0
Vitamin D Effect on In Vitro Fertilization\nVD insufficiency has been in the spotlight of in vitro fertilization (IVF) researchers for many years.,0
"Previously, most investigators wanted to determine the relationship between concentration of calcidiol in serum and follicular fluid.",0
Serum VD level correlated well with its follicular concentration ( p = 0.001) and was inversely proportional to BMI of the patients ( p = 0.04) [54].,0
"As stated in the previous report [2], much higher concentrations of follicular VD were found in Caucasians (76.1 ± 32.3 nmol/L) compared to people of African descent (47.1 ± 21.2 nmol/L, p = 0.001).",0
"Today, we know it is directly associated with rs6058017 gene polymorphism [35].",0
The VD levels in patients with clinical pregnancy (30.95%) were significantly higher ( p = 0.01) compared to those with early spontaneous abortion.,0
Patients with high initial VD levels (267.8 ± 66.4 nmol/L) had a four time better chance ( p = 0.02) for successful IVF procedure compared to the group with low VD levels (104.3 ± 21 nmol/L) [54].,0
"In 2012, similar results were obtained from a group of 188 IVF-treated females in a tertiary academic center.",0
"This time, a significant difference in VD levels was found between Caucasian and Asian women ( p = 0.001).",0
"It is interesting that in the Caucasian population, the chance of achieving clinical pregnancy (defined as fetal heartbeat visible in ultrasound at 7–8 weeks of gestation) increased with VD serum levels, while in Asians the reverse relationship was demonstrated [55].",0
"After cross analysis including the number and quality of transferred embryos, it was shown that the patients with proper VD levels have a four time higher chance for a successful procedure.",0
"Until 2014, it remained unknown which element—endometrial or egg quality—is more affected by VD deficiency.",0
"In this study, VD levels were estimated in donor’s serum before the embryo transfer.",0
"This very clever approach gave the authors of these, and of other similar studies from both Europe and the USA, reasons to state that their data strongly suggest that the effects of vitamin D may be mediated through the endometrium, not the follicle or oocyte [56,57].",0
Why is the Endometrium So Susceptible to VD Levels?,0
VD analog supplementation proved to be effective not only in fertility treatment but also in the prevention of type 1 diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and the prolongation of survival of syngeneic islets grafts [58].,0
"High VD serum levels and their derivatives are found in human decidua from the 1st trimester of pregnancy, which strongly suggests its contribution in the implantation process and a local immunological preference of the embryo.",0
"It has been proven that the synthesis of VD is higher in the 1st trimester (41 ± 11.8 fMole/h/mg) compared to the 3rd trimester (8 ± 4.4 fMole/h/mg, p< 0.05).",0
Quantitative analysis with RT-PCR showed higher gene expression of CYP27B1 in both stromal cells CD10+VEand CD10−VEin the 1st trimester of pregnancy.,0
The immunomodulating role of vitamin D was also confirmed by stimulation of NK cells (Natural Killer CD56+ve) isolated from the 1sttrimester decidua.,0
"As stated by the authors, the results of their study prove an increased production of active form of vitamin D in the first trimester decidua, which modulates reactions in a paracrine manner between the mother’s and the embryo’s immune system during the implantation.",0
"Disruptions of the process of major neovascularization can lead to serious pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia (PE) in further gestation.",0
"However, a clinical study that included 280 pregnant women did not demonstrate correlations between concentrations of VD and PE [59], probably due to its multi-causal etiology.",0
"Some earlier experiments, in which the serum and follicular fluid VD levels were compared with the pregnancy rate, did not show the same results.",0
"The serum and follicular fluid VD levels were in significant correlation, with p< 0.0000, but fertilization (43.17%, 53.37%, 58.77%, respectively) and implantation percentages (17.33, 15.26, 18.75%, respectively) did not present any significant correlation ( p> 0.5) [60].",0
Do we know how VD levels impact the oocyte quality?,0
Examination for concentration of VD2and glucose of follicular fluid in 101 patients treated with IVF-ICSI method reported poorer quality of embryos ( p = 0.01) and a lower rate of clinical pregnancies (14.5%) in patients with VD levels exceeding 75 nmol/L.,0
Meticulous observation should include seasonal and regional patterns.,0
"In a study of 188,075 cases, significant variations of semen characteristics have been observed with a clear improvement of sperm morphology in August [62].",0
"The clinic’s geographical location (region) should also be analyzed, because the midyear UVB intensity and VD intake in diet are different between populations.",0
"UVB intensity is a positive predictor of live birth following fresh ET, whereas altitude and annualized average regional temperature have an inverse relationship with live birth ratio following fresh ET [63].",0
Complex evaluation of vitamin D activity mechanism on fertility requires further studies.,0
Examining large groups of VD-deficient patients should not be a problem—most societies are VD-deficient either way.,0
"Epidemiological studies have shown that VD deficiency increases not only infertility rate but also the risk of serious pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia and preterm birth [64].",0
This is why even during the most physiological pregnancy vitamin D supplementation in the amount of 800–1000 IU daily is highly recommended [65].,0
"Even though some negative outcomes with U-shaped associations were observed, with risks at both low and high levels [66], the recent meta-analysis did not find any association with high VD levels and negative health outcomes [67].",0
The supplementation should be continued during the breast feeding period even in larger doses of 6000IU daily in order to avoid deficiency in neonates [68].,0
"During the preparation for pregnancy in VD-deficient females (with serum VD 50–125nmol/L), it is advised to supplement vitamin D prior to the first visit in a fertility clinic.",0
"This simple, inexpensive and safe treatment may prevent the need to use more invasive therapy.",0
To consistently raise the blood level of 25(OH)D above 75 nmol/L at least 1500–2000 IU/day VD is required [69].,0
"The doses for adults and elderly people of proper body weight, and pregnant and lactating women should not exceed 4000 IU daily, and the supplementation dosage recommended for pregnant women in winter and less sunny countries is 1500–4000 IU per day (37.5–50.0 μg/day) [10,66,70].",0
"Conclusions\nCurrent research on the role of vitamin D in fertility impairments, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, uterine fibroids, improper semen parameters and in the case of in vitro treatments and pregnancy failure, suggests it plays an important role in human reproduction processes.",0
Vitamin D supplementation is advised in infertility therapy in both partners.,0
"Couples with serum concentration exceeding 50 nmol/L have a higher chance of conception, but this does not regard all patients, where especially males should be supplemented with vitamin D from the beginning of the therapy.",0
"Administration of vitamin D is recommended in the case of considerable deficiency, particularly in obese, insulin resistant women with low AMH levels, as well as in men with oligo- and asthenozoospermia.",0
"Vitamin D is definitely not a Trojan Horse in reproductive health since there were no adverse effects reported for vitamin D intake of up to 10,000 IU/d [66], but to proclaim it the Golden Fleece, more evidence is still required.",0
Evaluating Provider Advice and Women’s Beliefs on Total Weight Gain During Pregnancy\n\nAbstract\nExcessive gestational weight gain (GWG) is associated with complications for both mother and child.,0
"Minority women are at increased risk for excessive GWG, yet are underrepresented in published weight control interventions.",0
"To inform future interventions, we examined the prevalence and accuracy of provider advice and its association with personal beliefs about necessary maternal weight gain among predominantly Latina pregnant women.",0
Only 23.6\xa0% of women reported being told how much weight to gain during pregnancy; although 58.6\xa0% received advice that met Institute of Medicine recommendations.,0
"Findings suggest the need for prenatal providers of low-income, minority women to engage patients in shaping healthy weight gain targets as a precursor to preventing excessive GWG and its complications.",0
"Introduction\nIn 2009, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) revised its guidelines for appropriate weight gain during pregnancy, taking into account the growing prevalence of obesity in women of childbearing age [1].",0
"(Table\xa01) Over 40\xa0% of pregnant women exceed the IOM recommendations for gestational weight gain (GWG), with overweight and obese women at increased risk [2].",0
"Excessive weight gain during pregnancy is associated with complications in delivery [3], increased postpartum weight retention [4], persistent obesity [4], increased BMI in offspring in childhood, adolescence and adulthood [5], and longer maternal hospital stay after labor and delivery [5].",0
"Caption (TABLE-WRAP): TABLE\xa01\n\nClinical recommendations for cumulative gestational weight gain by pre-pregnancy BMI for mothers of singletons and twins at gestational ages 37–42\xa0weeks (IOM, 2009 )Prepregnancy BMIRecommended range ofCumulative weight gain (lbs)SingletonTwinsUnderweight (<18.5\xa0kg/m2)28–40–Normal (18.5–24.9\xa0kg/m2)25–3537–54Overweight (25.0–29.9\xa0kg/m2)15–2531–50Obese (≥30.0\xa0kg/m2)11–2024–42\nActual weight gain during pregnancy is strongly influenced by provider recommendation [6,7].",0
"Evidence shows that women’s actual weight gain during pregnancy is strongly influenced by personal beliefs and healthcare providers’ advice [6,7].",0
"When women receive weight gain advice that is inconsistent with IOM recommendations (i.e., above or below), they are 3.6 times more likely to gain more or less than IOM recommendations, respectively [7].",0
"Women whose personal weight gain targets are below IOM recommendations are five times more likely to gain less than recommended, and women with targets above the recommendations are six times more likely to gain more than recommended [7].",0
There is limited data about the beliefs of Latinas on GWG even though the problem of excessive weight gain during pregnancy is particularly important for this group which now comprises 20\xa0% of new mothers in the US [1].,0
This increased rate of overweight and obesity puts Latinas at increased risk for excessive GWG.,0
The purpose of this paper is to examine the prevalence and accuracy of provider advice on maternal weight gain and its association with personal beliefs about necessary maternal weight gain within a sample of predominantly Latina pregnant women who received prenatal care in their dominant language.,0

This vulnerable population is already at increased risk of excessive GWG and the concomitant adverse effects on mother and child.,0
Provider advice is key in helping women meet appropriate GWG targets [6].,0
"While less than a quarter of women in our study reported receiving any information on weight gain, those who did were more likely to have target weights within clinical recommendations.",0
"Yet similar to other reports in predominantly white women [6], we found that pre-pregnancy BMI is strongly associated with Latina women’s target weight gain.",0
"Together, these findings suggest that providers are as comfortable discussing weight gain restrictions with overweight and obese women as they are with normal weight women, but that overweight and obese women still have weight gain targets in excess of clinical guidelines.",0
Providers may need to re-emphasize their recommendations with overweight and obese patients to help align their personal weight gain targets with current clinical recommendations.,0
Both the lack of receipt of clinical guidance and the recollection of inaccurate information observed in this study are of concern because receipt of provider advice has been shown in prior work to be the most important predictor of a woman’s weight gain target [6].,0
Women who have a weight gain target that is concordant with IOM recommendation are less likely to have excessive weight gain [4].,0
"In our study, normal weight mothers were more likely to have low weight gain targets, whereas overweight and obese women were more likely to have high weight gain targets.",0
This is of concern because excessive weight gain is associated with postpartum weight retention and persistent maternal obesity [4].,0
Other work has shown that generational acculturation was positively associated with excessive GWG [10].,0
"While low maternal education has been associated with higher rates of excessive weight gain [2], our study did not find any significant effect of maternal education on weight gain target.",0
Understanding beliefs about appropriate weight gain during pregnancy is crucial for intervention planning.,0
The strength of this study is its focus on minority women who are underrepresented in published GWG interventions yet carry increased burden of gaining excessively during pregnancy.,0
"However, those who did receive advice were more likely to have personal weight gain targets in line with current clinical recommendations.",0
"These data suggest that prenatal care providers of low-income, minority women in particular should make healthy maternal weight gain targets a priority in their care to prevent excessive weight gain during pregnancy and the associated complications.",0
Racial disparities in cord blood vitamin D levels and its association with small-for-gestational-age infants\n\nAbstract\n\nObjective:\nTo examine the relationship of race and maternal characteristics and their association with cord blood vitamin D levels and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) status.,0
"Results:\nBlack race, Medicaid status, mean body mass index at delivery and lack of prenatal vitamin use were associated with vitamin D deficiency.",0
"Conclusion:\nIdentification of risk factors (black race, Medicaid status, obesity and lack of prenatal vitamin use) can lead to opportunities for targeted prenatal vitamin supplementation to reduce the risk of neonatal vitamin D deficiency and SGA status.",0
"Introduction\nVitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)) is commonly known for its role in calcium metabolism and bone health, but more recently has gained attention for the significant role it plays in pregnancy and perinatal outcomes.",0
"Thus, levels of neonates at birth depend entirely on that of the mother and, accordingly, several studies have consistently correlated cord blood 25(OH)D levels to those of their mothers.1,2,3,4,5,6In addition, maternal vitamin D deficiency has been linked to decreased fetal growth and birth size in observational studies.7,8,9\nMaternal vitamin D deficiency is prevalent, the extent of which can be influenced by many variables including skin pigmentation, sun exposure, season, age, vitamin supplementation and obesity.",0
"Several large observational studies and meta-analyses have described the association of maternal vitamin D deficiency with pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes and premature birth.10,11,12,13Racial disparities in maternal and neonatal vitamin D deficiency have been described.1,14,15Vitamin D deficiency is more common and more severe in black mothers.10,15,16,17,18,19Racial disparities are also seen with pregnancy complications such as preterm birth, pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes, as well as adverse neonatal outcomes including low birth weight and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) status.15,17,20,21However, the majority of studies examined maternal vitamin D levels during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy7,8,22,23and correlated these levels to neonatal outcomes.",0
"Far fewer studies have examined the relationship between cord blood vitamin D levels, which may more accurately reflect fetal levels of vitamin D, and neonatal outcomes.14,24Given the racial disparities seen in both vitamin D deficiency and perinatal outcomes, vitamin D has been proposed as part of the explanation for this disparity, particularly with regard to fetal growth and SGA.8\nIncreased awareness of the growing prevalence of maternal vitamin D deficiency has led to an urgent need for consideration of supplementation during pregnancy.",0
"Although studies have shown that supplementation increases maternal and cord blood vitamin D levels, changes in clinical outcomes have not yet been well proven.",0
"Thus, sufficient evidence is lacking at this time to recommend routine vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy.12However, identification of specific risk factors for vitamin D deficiency and the additive effects of these risk factors may lead to opportunities for targeted supplementation with improved outcomes.",0
"Thus, the primary purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between race, maternal characteristics, cord blood vitamin D levels and SGA status among infants during one winter season in a Midwestern US population.",0
"In particular, we wanted to evaluate the additive effects of race and maternal characteristics such as obesity on vitamin D deficiency and SGA.",0
Our goal was to identify specific high-risk subsets of pregnant women who may benefit from vitamin D supplementation in order to mitigate adverse perinatal outcomes such as SGA.,0
SGA was defined as weight <10% for gestational age according to the Fenton growth chart25and the WHO growth chart (for infants of ⩾37 weeks).26All information was deidentified and entered into a REDCap database.27\n\nCord blood sample analysis\nCord blood samples were spun and the serum was frozen at −80\u2009°C.,0
"To explore relationships between race, vitamin D levels and SGA, we first evaluated race as a predictor of vitamin D levels (sufficient or deficient) in cord blood and assessed for potential confounders: Medicaid status, BMI at delivery, hypertension, maternal age and prenatal vitamin use.",0
"These results informed the next stage of analyses that examined race and vitamin D levels with the outcome of SGA by assessing potential confounders: race, smoking, pre-eclampsia, maternal age, Medicaid status and BMI at delivery.",0
"Differences in the distributions of cord blood 25(OH)D concentrations by race were evident (Figure 1), with a higher proportion of vitamin D-deficient samples found in the black population.",0
"Race, Medicaid status, higher BMI at delivery and lack of prenatal vitamin use were all associated with vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D <50\u2009nmol\u2009l−1; P<0.01).",0
"Similarly, infants on Medicaid, a marker of socioeconomic status, had higher odds of vitamin D deficiency (odds ratio (OR) 2.3, 95% CI: 1.4, 3.8), whereas prenatal vitamin use showed a protective effect (OR 0.24, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.62).",0
"For instance, at a mean maternal BMI of 32.3\u2009kg\u2009m−2, an infant who is black, on Medicaid and no prenatal vitamin use has an 86% (95% CI: 82, 97) probability of vitamin D deficiency, whereas a black infant who is not on Medicaid and with prenatal vitamin use has a 66% (95% CI: 44, 67) probability of vitamin D deficiency.",0
"As vitamin D levels also differed by race, we stratified the models predicting SGA by race and examined vitamin D deficiency, smoking, pre-eclampsia, maternal age, Medicaid status and BMI at delivery as covariates (Table 3).",0
"Black infants with vitamin D deficiency had 2.4 greater odds of SGA (95% CI: 1.0, 5.8) after adjusting for maternal history of PIH and maternal BMI, two significant confounding variables in our model (Table 3).",0
"Similarly, infants of black mothers with history of PIH were associated with 2.3 greater odds of SGA after adjustment for confounding variables.",0
"We examined several additional models with various cutpoints for 25(OH)D based on clinical guidelines and previous literature, while adjusting for maternal PIH and maternal BMI at delivery.",0
"These results indicated that black neonates with 25(OH)D levels <25\u2009nmol\u2009l−1had an even greater odds of being SGA (OR 3.8, 95% CI: 1.4, 10.6) compared with those with levels ⩾50\u2009nmol\u2009l−1.",0
The small proportion of neonates who were SGA with 25(OH)D levels >75\u2009nmol\u2009l−1precluded evaluation at higher cutpoints.,0
"Although SGA status was the main outcome of our study, we also evaluated models of 25(OH)D and birth weight percentile after adjusting for maternal PIH and maternal BMI at delivery.",0
"Discussion\nIn our study population, we found that compared with white infants, black infants had significantly lower cord blood vitamin D levels and a greater proportion of vitamin D deficiency.",0
"Although the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in black mothers and neonates is well known, debate exists as to the relationship between race, vitamin D deficiency and SGA.12,14,15,17,18We examined this relationship in conjunction with additional maternal characteristics in order to identify groups of pregnant women who could benefit most from vitamin D supplementation.",0
"We found that black race was associated with a significantly greater incidence of SGA, and that black race and vitamin D deficiency together were associated with even greater odds of SGA.",0
"Based on our analysis, a minimum threshold cord blood 25(OH)D level of 50\u2009nmol\u2009l−1was protective against SGA status among black infants.",0
"Interestingly however, white race with vitamin D deficiency was not significantly associated with increased odds of SGA.",0
"Only a small proportion of white infants were SGA, and this may have limited our ability to detect significant associations between vitamin D and SGA among white infants.",0
"Vitamin D may affect fetal growth through its effect on calcium metabolism, bone growth and placental development.32Although initial studies showed conflicting results, more recent studies suggest that vitamin D deficiency may adversely affect growth and lead to low birth weight or SGA infants.7,9,11,12,18,22,23,33Because of a known relationship between race and vitamin D status, attention then turned to investigation of the relationship between race, vitamin D deficiency and SGA.",0
"Bodnar et al.8conducted a case–control study to examine the association between vitamin D levels, race and SGA.",0
"[""For white mothers, measurement of maternal serum 25(OH)D at <22 weeks' gestation showed a U-shaped relationship between vitamin D status and risk of SGA, where the highest risk for SGA was seen with both low and high vitamin D levels.""]",0
"However, no relationship was seen between vitamin D status and SGA among black mothers.",0
"In a larger study, Burris et al.14examined the relationship between second-trimester serum 25(OH)D levels and SGA in blacks and whites and found a higher risk of SGA in both vitamin D-deficient black and white infants.",0
Gernand et al.22also examined second-trimester vitamin D levels and risk of SGA in a population at risk of pre-eclampsia.,0
"They found that vitamin D status was associated with risk of SGA in white and nonobese women, but that there was no association between vitamin D and SGA in black or obese mothers.",0
"In contrast to the above-mentioned studies, our results show that the combination of black race and vitamin D deficiency was associated with increased odds of SGA, but this relationship was not preserved for white infants.",0
Our results may have differed for several reasons.,0
"First, the majority of populations in the studies of Bodnar et al.8and Burris et al.14were white, whereas the majority of our study population was black.",0
"Furthermore, this study was conducted in Hamilton County, Ohio, an area with worse perinatal outcomes than national averages, including higher infant mortality, preterm birth and low birth weight rates, as well as considerable racial disparities in infant mortality and perinatal outcomes.34All of cord blood samples were collected over one winter season, thus negating seasonal variations in vitamin D levels that may have been seen in other studies.",0
"Finally, we analyzed cord blood vitamin D levels at the time of delivery, rather than maternal serum vitamin D levels during pregnancy.",0
"Although cord blood 25(OH)D levels do correlate to maternal levels, factors that affect fetal growth may not be uniform throughout pregnancy and this difference in timing could affect study findings.1,3,4,5,6In addition, maternal characteristics such as obesity or pre-eclampsia could also affect results that may not have been seen if vitamin D samples were obtained during early pregnancy.",0
"Concurrently, we also examined maternal variables known to potentially affect vitamin D levels and SGA in an effort to better understand the role of these risk factors in vitamin D levels and risk of SGA.",0
"Our results showed several factors to be significant, including BMI at delivery, pre-eclampsia, Medicaid status (as a measure of socioeconomic status) and prenatal vitamin use.",0
"Obesity is well known to be a risk factor for vitamin D deficiency because of a sequestering of vitamin D in adipose tissue.35Maternal obesity during pregnancy has also been associated with lower vitamin D levels in neonates at delivery.24,36,37,38Our data are consistent and illustrate the inverse relationship between maternal BMI at delivery and vitamin D status after adjusting for confounding variables.",0
"The increased odds of vitamin D deficiency in neonates relative to maternal BMI level were seen in both blacks and whites in our study population and supports similar findings seen in a study done by Bodnar et al.38Although prenatal vitamin use was not significantly different between blacks and whites in our study, prenatal vitamin use was significant among those with and without vitamin D deficiency.",0
"Furthermore, the protective effect against vitamin D deficiency was seen in both blacks and whites in our study, in contrast to a recently published study by Burris et al.",0
",39who found that lack of prenatal vitamin use was associated with vitamin D deficiency in white but not black women.",0
"Importantly, our study illustrates the additive effect of maternal risk factors and their predictive probabilities for vitamin D deficiency and SGA.",0
Black mothers on Medicaid who were obese and did not take prenatal vitamins had the highest probability of having an infant with vitamin D deficiency.,0
Pre-eclampsia is a known independent risk factor for SGA.,0
"Pre-eclampsia, coupled with black race and vitamin D deficiency, resulted in significant increases in the predicted probability of delivering an SGA infant.",0
"Interestingly, our results show that increasing maternal BMI had a mild protective effect on risk of SGA.",0
"This corresponds to the well-known association that women with higher BMI tend to deliver infants with higher birth weights.40,41,42\nFurthermore, identification and recognition of women and infants at high risk of vitamin D deficiency and SGA can lead to opportunities for risk modification and reduction in adverse outcomes.",0
"Specifically, this study supports a need to target supplementation strategies to mitigate the impact of adverse perinatal outcomes such as SGA.",0
"Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy has been shown to positively affect cord blood vitamin D levels at birth.43,44Studies of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy thus far have shown conflicting results with respect to birth weight and reduction of SGA.43,45,46,47,48Adequately powered and randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy are needed to assess the impact of supplementation on SGA as well as the appropriate dose and timing of supplementation.",0
"In addition, individuals with the risk factors that we have identified may benefit even more from supplementation or higher dose supplementation.",0
"If vitamin D supplementation does not occur during pregnancy, it may be imperative to identify and offer additional supplementation beyond the routinely recommended 400\u2009IU per day for all infants.28\nThere were several limitations to our study.",0
"First, we did not have information regarding exact amounts of dietary maternal vitamin D intake and sun exposure that may affect maternal and cord blood vitamin D levels.",0
We collected samples over one winter season to mitigate the effect of varying sun exposure.,0
Corresponding maternal vitamin D status at different gestations during pregnancy was unknown.,0
This would have allowed for a more expansive definition of the relationship between maternal vitamin D status and perinatal outcomes.,0
"Finally, as a retrospective study, we were limited by available data and the amount of cord blood available for further testing.",0
Conclusion\nBlack obese mothers on Medicaid without prenatal vitamin use were at the highest risk of delivering neonates with vitamin D deficiency.,0
"Furthermore, black race and vitamin D deficiency were associated with an increased risk of SGA.",0
We identified additive and modifiable maternal risk factors that would benefit most from risk reduction and targeted vitamin D supplementation.,0
A greater understanding of the variables that influence vitamin D status during pregnancy can have an immense public health impact in the reduction of adverse perinatal outcomes such as SGA.,0
Low cord-serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with poor lung function performance and increased respiratory infection in infancy\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nPerinatal vitamin D deficiency is associated with a higher risk of wheezing in childhood.,0
"However, the relationship between vitamin D levels and lung function in infancy has not been investigated.",0
The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of perinatal vitamin D levels on respiratory function and disease outcome in infancy.,0
"25(OH)D levels in maternal and cord serum were highly correlated ( r2= 0.457, p< 0.0001).",0
Infants with lower cord serum 25(OH)D levels (< 13.7 ng/ml) had higher resistance of respiratory system ( p< 0.01) and a higher risk of a respiratory tract infection before the age of 6 months ( p< 0.01).,0
"Conclusion\nAlthough a high correlation was found between maternal and cord vitamin D levels, the effect on respiratory outcome was different.",0
Our study is the first to show that low cord 25(OH)D levels significantly relationship with poorer lung function performance and higher likelihood of a respiratory tract infection before 6 months of age.,0
Introduction\nVitamin D is crucial not only for calcium metabolism and skeletal health but also in the homeostasis of many other systems.,0
"Since the discovery that most tissues and cells have vitamin D receptors, there has been great interest in its role in the development of many diseases, such as cancer [1], cardiovascular diseases [2], infectious diseases [3], and autoimmune disease [4].",0
reported an inverse correlation between prenatal vitamin D intake and recurrent wheezing of offspring [5].,0
Measurements of vitamin D serum level 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] have yielded conflicting results regarding the relationship between maternal- or cord-blood levels and subsequent asthma development [6–15].,0
"However, Baiz et al.",0
"have recently shown that infants with low cord serum vitamin D levels have a higher risk of childhood wheezing [7,11].",0
"Although episodes of wheezing during childhood are mostly caused by a viral respiratory infection, their detailed pathogenesis and relationship with asthma are unclear.",0
"classified childhood wheezing into four distinct phenotypes: no wheezing, transient early wheezing, late-onset wheezing, and persistent wheezing [16].",0
"In the study, the majority of infants with transient early wheezing had diminished airway function in early life.",0
A recent study further revealed that cord serum 25(OH)D levels were inversely correlated with the risk of transient early wheezing [11].,0
"However, the relationship between vitamin D levels and respiratory function during infancy has not yet been clarified.",0
The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of perinatal vitamin D levels on the performance of respiratory function in infancy.,0
"The secondary objective was to further clarify the effect on the risk of eczema, wheezing, and respiratory tract infections in early life.",0
"Neonates born prematurely (gestational age < 37 weeks), those with major birth defects or congenital structural anomalies of the upper airway, those who were hemodynamically unstable, and those with a history of severe lower airway infection with intensive care admission, were excluded from the study.",0
"Since there were few adverse events being reported, chloral hydrate has been the preferred medication for infant lung function tests for over 20 years at US and Europe [21].",0
"Infant lung function testing was performed with the Jaeger Masterscreen BabyBody Paediatrics System (CareFusion, Höchberg, Germany), which conforms with the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society recommendations [22–25].",0
"There was a significant positive correlation between maternal and cord serum 25(OH)D levels ( r2= 0.457, p< 0.0001;Fig 2).",0
"The mean 25(OH)D level of the 71 infants who successfully underwent later infant lung function testing was 13.8 ± 6.3 ng/ml, and that of their mothers was 15.0 ± 6.1 ng/ml, which were also significantly correlated ( r2= 0.468, p< 0.0001).10.1371/journal.pone.0173268.g002\n\nCaption (FIG): FIG 2\nCorrelation between maternal and cord serum 25(OH)D levels.",0
"Lung function and outcome vs 25(OH)D levels\nTo compare the effect of cord 25(OH)D level on lung function at 6 months of age, we defined those with cord 25(OH)D level ≥ 13.8 ng/ml as the “high cord 25(OH)D” group, and the rest as the “low cord 25(OH)D” group.",0
"In addition, maternal 25D(OH) level ≥15.0 ng/ml was described as “high maternal 25(OH)D” and <15.0 ng/ml as “low maternal 25(OH)D.”\nA significant difference in the Rrs was found between the high and low cord 25(OH)D groups (3.8 ± 0.8 vs. 4.4 ± 1.0 kPa*s/L, p< 0.01).",0
"After adjusting for body length and comparing with a local reference, the high cord 25(OH)D group still had significantly lower Rrs than did the low cord 25(OH)D group (Table 1).",0
"However, no differences were noted in the various parameters of lung function between high and low maternal 25(OH)D groups (Table 2).",0
"Although the incidence of infant wheeze was similar between the groups, the percentage of respiratory tract infection was significantly higher in infants with a low cord serum 25(OH)D level (Table 1).",0
"The analysis showed that high cord 25(OH)D was the strongest predictor of good lung function performance (Table 3), and vice versa, low cord level predicted poor lung function outcome.",0
"Meanwhile, paternal history with allergic rhinitis and maternal smoke in pregnancy also had adverse effect on lung function.",0
"However, low cord 25(OH)D alone was the only predicted higher probability of respiratory infection in the first 6 months of life (Table 4).10.1371/journal.pone.0173268.t003\n\nCaption (TABLE-WRAP): TABLE 3\nMultiple linear regression analysis of lung function outcome (Z score of Rrs).Beta (s.e.",0
Discussion\nA positive correlation was found between 25(OH)D levels in the serum of mother and child in this prospective birth cohort study.,0
This is the first report to show that low cord—and not maternal—serum 25(OH)D levels contribute to relatively poor lung performance at 6 months of age.,0
An increased risk for a respiratory tract infection before the age of 6 months was also found in infants with low cord 25(OH)D level.,0
"However, no differences were found in the incidence of wheeze and eczema or the rate of nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization between the groups with high and low 25(OH)D levels of mother—cord serum pairs.",0
"Infants who were exclusively breastfed or had high levels of skin pigmentation, inadequate sunlight exposure, or inadequate vitamin supplement are at risk of a vitamin D deficiency [26].",0
"Although a circulating level of 25(OH)D less than 20 ng/mL is defined as vitamin D deficiency [27,28], the mean levels may vary among different populations [29].",0
"In previous studies, mean 25(OH)D levels were generally higher than 20 ng/ml in maternal serum [6,8,9].",0
"However, cord serum levels ranged widely from 10.95 to 34.4 ng/mL [7,11–13,30].",0
"In this study, the mean 25(OH)D level in the cord serum (13.8 ng/mL) was comparable with other reports, but a lower mean level in the maternal serum (15.0 ng/mL) was observed.",0
These suboptimal levels were also seen in recent reports by Liao et al [31].,0
"Nevertheless, fair correlations between mother and cord blood were found in previous and this study as well [9].",0
"Animal studies have found that vitamin D deficiency can cause deficits in lung function, which can be explained by a change in lung development [32].",0
"Similarly, in a large birth cohort study, infants with low cord serum 25(OH)D had a higher risk of transient wheeze before the age of 5 years [11].",0
The COPSAC2000study have failed to show an association between cord 25(OH)D level and lung function at 7 years of age [33].,0
Also no association was also found between a children’s vitamin D levels and their lung function at 6–7 years of age in the KOALA birth cohort study [34].,0
"However, in contrary to these reports, a survey in Canadian children showed that both low and high vitamin D levels were related to increased risk of wheeze and reduced performance of lung function [35].",0
"However, comparing to our study, the median level of cord 25(OH)D of COPSAC2000was relatively high (19 ng/ml).",0
"Furthermore, instead of measuring cord serum 25(OH)D, both KOALA and Canadian studies determined the level of 25(OH)D during preschool or school age.",0
"Regarding to the relationship between 25(OH)D and lung function in adults, the HUNT study revealed that low serum 25(OH)D level was not associated with airway obstruction in most asthma adults with the exception of males with asthma but without allergic rhinitis [36].",0
"Therefore, drawing conclusions about the effects of perinatal and postnatal vitamin D status from these results can be difficult.",0
"In this study, although cord serum 25(OH)D level was not associated with higher risk of wheeze at 6 months, it is related with increased respiratory resistance.",0
"Furthermore, it is worth noticing that the increased airway resistance may result in a higher risk of wheezing in early childhood.",0
Infant lung function testing has been widely used in research and clinical practices.,0
Measurements of resistance and forced expiration are the most commonly used maneuvers to assess airway function.,0
"By comparison, forced expiration maneuvers more closely reflect the function of the intrathoracic airway.",0
"In this study, infants with low 25(OH)D had higher Rrs but similar VmaxFRC, which implies that low perinatal vitamin D levels might be associated with a higher resistance of the extrathoracic airway.",0
The fetal vitamin D status is dependent on the placental-fetal circulation.,0
"Though, the interpretation of serum 25(OH)D level may be complicated by the presence of C3-epimer of 25(OH)D [C3-epi-25(OH)D], a vitamin metabolite that may be erroneously included as 25(OH)D by LC-MS and immunoassay methods [43].",0
"Bailey et al had discovered that, after transplacental circulation, the concentration of C3-epi-25(OH)D was significant higher in infants than mother [44].",0
"Therefore, the high concentration of C3-epi-25(OH)D in infants may explain that low cord—but not maternal—serum 25(OH)D levels contribute to poor lung function and increased risk of respiratory infection in this study.",0
Recent studies have shown that vitamin D can directly stimulate several immune cells and can promote the production of antimicrobial peptides [45–47].,0
"In asthmatic children, episodes of acute exacerbation relating to respiratory infection were also inversely associated with serum 25(OH)D levels [49].",0
"In a randomized control trial, a vitamin D supplement can even decrease the risk of seasonal flu in children [50].",0
"Because of substantial antibody levels from transplacental transmission, infants are less likely to get respiratory infection before 6 months of age.",0
has shown that infants with low cord serum 25(OH)D levels have a higher risk of respiratory tract infection before the age of 3 months [7].,0
"However, the exact association between single cord-serum vitamin D level and postnatal immunity is unclear.",0
More investigation is required to further understand the role of vitamin D for the prevention of respiratory tract infection in infancy.,0
There are some potential limitations to our findings.,0
"First, in cause of the difficulties in performing infant lung function testing, relatively small number of mother-infant pairs was enrolled in this study.",0
"In post hoc analysis of two-tail t test, the statistical power could reach 0.6 (alpha risk, 0.05; effect size, 0.5).",0
"In addition, in the regression model for analysis of predictors, the power still can achieve as high as 0.8 (alpha risk, 0.05; effect size f2, 0.15).",0
"Second, our previous report concluded that relatively low vitamin D levels were common in the PATCH population sample of children and young adults with an inverse correlation between 25(OH)D level and age being shown here [51].",0
"The majority of the participants lived in Keelung, a rainy city whose inhabitants have a higher risk of vitamin D deficiency than elsewhere due to lack of sun exposure [52].",0
"In our study, the mean 25(OH)D level of the maternal serum was low, at 15 ng/ml, which might hinder our investigation.",0
"Third, a large percentage of infants in the low cord 25(OH)D group were male, although our previous study found no gender difference in the infant lung function test [18].",0
"Furthermore, the measurement of respiratory mechanics relies on both the absence of airflow and the invocation of the Hering—Breuer reflex while occluding the air outflow [53].",0
"Although this technique is relatively noninvasive and easy to perform, there is limited evidence showing that the Rrs is sensitive enough to distinguish between different groups of infants with various clinical conditions [54].",0
"Therefore, defining the causal relationship between Rrs and clinical outcomes in infants with low cord serum 25(OH)D levels is difficult.",0
"Last, the sample size was rather small, and the vitamin D levels of the participants were generally suboptimal in our study.",0
"Although poor lung function performance and an increased risk of respiratory tract infection were related to relatively low cord serum vitamin D levels, further extrapolating the effects of vitamin D on the respiratory function of the general infant population might still be difficult.",0
"In conclusion, this study is the first to reveal that infants with low cord serum 25(OH)D levels have poorer lung function at 6 months of age compared with those with high levels.",0
They also have a higher risk of a respiratory tract infection before this age.,0
"Although cord vitamin D levels are strongly correlated with maternal vitamin D levels, the extent of the impact on later respiratory function is distinctive.",0
We believe that this study provides a clearer understanding of the effect of perinatal vitamin D levels on respiratory function and respiratory outcome in infancy.,0
Association of influenza vaccination during pregnancy with birth outcomes in Nicaragua\n\nAbstract\nBackground: Studies have shown that influenza vaccination during pregnancy reduces the risk of influenza disease in pregnant women and their offspring.,0
Some have proposed that maternal vaccination may also have beneficial effects on birth outcomes.,0
"In 2014, we conducted an observational study to test this hypothesis using data from two large hospitals in Managua, Nicaragua.",0
Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate associations between influenza vaccination and birth outcomes.,0
We assessed self-reports of influenza vaccination status by further reviewing medical records of those who self-reported but did not have readily available evidence of vaccination status.,0
"With PSM, after adjusting for risk factors, we observed protective associations between influenza vaccination in the second and third trimester and preterm birth (aOR: 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.75–0.99 and aOR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.45–0.96, respectively) and between influenza vaccination in the second trimester and low birth weight (aOR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.64–0.97).",0
Conclusions: We found evidence to support an association between influenza vaccination and birth outcomes by trimester of receipt with data from an urban population in Nicaragua.,0
The study had significant selection and recall biases.,0
Prospective studies are needed to minimize these biases.,0
"Introduction\nInfection with influenza during pregnancy and its association with adverse birth outcomes has been documented since the early 1900s[1],[2].",0
"For instance, infection with influenza virus during pregnancy may prompt an inflammatory [cascade] response that is associated with preterm birth[3],[4].",0
"Influenza vaccination has been shown to reduce the risk of influenza virus disease and its complications among pregnant women and their infants[5],[6],[7],[8],[9],[10],[11],[12],[13],[14],[15].",0
"Furthermore, some studies have found a beneficial effect of influenza vaccination on birth outcomes, specifically a decreased likelihood of delivering a baby preterm or small for gestational age[16],[17],[18],[19],[20],[21],[22].",0
"Other studies, however, have found no evidence to support this hypothesis[23],[24],[25],[26],[27],[28],[29],[30].",0
"Published studies have differed substantially from one another in design and in ability to account for variations in circulating influenza viruses, vaccine components, target population, and place of study, making cross-study comparisons difficult[31].",0
Historic influenza surveillance data from Nicaragua shows that influenza circulates between June and November[32].,0
"Since 2007, the Nicaraguan Government has provided influenza vaccination to women with high-risk pregnancies in the month of May, following the vaccination schedule for countries with southern hemisphere circulation of influenza viruses[33],[34].",0
"With the aim of evaluating the hypothesis that influenza vaccination has a beneficial effect on birth outcomes, we collected birth outcome data, current influenza vaccination status, and risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes by interviewing post-partum women at two large hospitals in Managua.",0
"Methods\n\nSurvey\n\nSample size calculation\nSample size planning was informed by calculating sample needs in order to detect a 40% reduction of low birth weight among newborns of vaccinated (regardless of vaccination trimester) compared to unvaccinated mothers[20],[21], assuming a two-sided 95% confidence level, 80% power, and a ratio of unvaccinated to vaccinated of 2:5[33].",0
A design effect of 1.5 was considered to account for any potential biases.,0
The sample size required was estimated to be 2769 (1938 vaccinated and 831 unvaccinated pregnant women).,0
"Influenza vaccination was self-reported; however, interviewers validated this information using vaccination cards and/or antenatal medical records if available.",0
"Sample size of the random sample, per group, was calculated using the formula to estimate a proportion assuming that 90% of those who self-reported being vaccinated or unvaccinated status were truly vaccinated or unvaccinated, respectively[37].",0
"Due to the low PPV and high NPV, we excluded from further analyses women who self-reported vaccination status but did not present evidence of vaccination, and we included all participants who self-reported non-vaccination status.",0
A proxy variable was calculated for cumulative influenza exposure using influenza surveillance data from Nicaragua[38].,0
"Birth outcome data were defined and calculated as follows: (1) gestational age at delivery was calculated using LMP, if available, or gestational age at any ultrasound obtained from antenatal medical records (seeSupplementary material A1for gestational age calculation algorithm); (2) small for gestational age (SGA) was calculated from weight and gestational age at delivery according to the International Fetal and Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21st Century, or intergrowth-21st standards[36]; (3) preterm birth (PTB) was defined as born with <37\xa0weeks of gestational age; and (4) low birth weight (LBW) was defined as born weighing <2500\xa0g.\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe compared all variables by vaccination status using chi-square test to compare differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated women regardless of trimester of receipt of influenza vaccination.",0
"When the requirement was not met, we randomly sampled from the vaccinated cases to obtain an unvaccinated to vaccinated ratio greater than one.",0
"As a secondary investigation, we assessed the association of influenza vaccination and birth outcomes by trimester in which women received influenza vaccination; the unvaccinated group was used as a control for all models.",0
"Ninety-seven percent (3172) reported having at least one antenatal visit during pregnancy, 78% (2549) reported four or more antenatal visits, and 91% (2984) reported having at least one dose of tetanus vaccine; all of these antenatal care indicators were significantly more common among vaccinated compared to unvaccinated women.",0
"More than half of the surveyed women (57%) reported having at least one chronic condition (obesity, diabetes, asthma, renal disease, liver disease, blood disease, neurologic disease); conditions were more common among vaccinated (60%) than unvaccinated women (53%) (p-value\xa0<\xa00.01).",0
"However, only among participants vaccinated in the first trimester, the percentage with preterm birth was 12%, significantly higher than the unvaccinated group (6%; p-value\xa0<\xa00.05;Supplementary material A2).",0
"In both models, we observed a trend whereby the later in pregnancy a women received vaccination the lower her adjusted odds of PTB.",0
"However, the protective effect of influenza vaccination on PTB among those receiving vaccination in their second and third trimester was significant with PSM (aOR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.75–0.99 and aOR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.45–0.96, respectively;Table 4).",0
"In addition, we found a protective effect of influenza vaccination on LBW among those vaccinated in the second trimester (aOR: 0.80; 95%CI: 0.64–0.97) using PSM.",0
Further analyses including those who self-reported vaccination showed similar trends (seeSupplementary materials A3-A5).,0
Discussion\nThe present study did not find an association between maternal influenza vaccination administered at any point in pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes among their babies.,0
"However, in secondary analyses stratifying influenza vaccination by trimester we observed a protective effect of vaccination on PTB in the second and third trimester and on LBW in the second trimester.",0
"Although there is a possibility that vaccination can explain these protective effects, observational studies have inherent biases that preclude them from establishing causality[41],[42].",0
"Using PSM, we observed a protective effect of influenza vaccination on PTB and LBW among those vaccinated in the second and third trimester.",0
"Although not statistically significant, the MLR approach also trended in the same direction.",0
"Likely, the analysis with PSM corrected for biases related to the probability of influenza vaccination by controlling for differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated women that we were not able to control for in MLR[43].",0
"Our findings are consistent with a number of studies that found an association between receiving influenza vaccination and reduced likelihood of delivering a baby PTB or with LBW[16],[17],[18],[19],[20],[21],[22].",0
"In addition, a recent meta-analysis found a strong association between receipt of influenza vaccination and reduced likelihood of PTB and LBW, and the magnitude of the association that Nunes et al.",0
reported was comparable to our findings[44].,0
"On the other hand, numerous other studies report a lack of association between influenza vaccination and birth outcomes[23],[24],[25],[26],[27],[28],[29],[30].",0
Two of these studies used similar methods to our study.,0
"analyzed the large Vaccine Safety Datalink dataset (n\xa0=\xa057,554 pregnant women in the United States) to assess these associations and after using propensity score to minimize bias introduced by the probability of being vaccinated found no association between influenza vaccination during pregnancy and risk of SGA or PTB[26].",0
"also did not find an association when analyzing retrospective data by trimester of vaccination and applying propensity score to account for the probability of vaccination; however, this study was performed during the 2009 pandemic so may not be directly comparable[29].",0
"Overall, differences in study design, populations, influenza virus and circulation variability make it a challenge to compare results[31].",0
"Observational studies like ours are subject to potential residual confounding, and Vazquez-Benitez et al.",0
[43]demonstrated that not accounting for biases in observational data can mislead the results.,0
"In our study, in addition to social desirability or recall bias on key variables like chronic conditions, there may have been residual confounding as we did not collect information on other risk factors known to be associated with adverse neonatal outcomes, such as previous history of adverse birth outcomes, domestic violence, harsh working conditions, or exposure to pollutants or chemicals[45],[46],[47],[48],[49],[50].",0
"In addition, we lacked specific information regarding the timing of antenatal supplements or health complications during pregnancy, and the literature shows that the timing of these events with respect to trimester of gestation could be associated with birth outcomes[51],[52].",0
We acknowledge the following limitations.,0
"However, little is known about how well the recommendations were implemented.",0
"Indeed, vaccine uptake remained somewhat higher among pregnant women with pre-existing chronic medical conditions in our study year suggesting that the recommendation may have been slow to take effect.",0
Higher vaccination among pregnant women with high-risk pregnancies could have caused a selection bias as those vaccinated women would have been at higher risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes compared to unvaccinated women.,0
"Second, the sample was not randomly selected.",0
"Women who agreed to participate in the study could have been different from women who did not participate in the study, and we did not collect characteristics on women who refused to participate in the study to ascertain this bias.",0
"Third, we did not power the sample size to analyze effects by trimester of vaccination and so may have missed important effects.",0
"Fourth, we based our calculation of gestational age at delivery on LMP which is known to be subject to recall bias and could have introduced errors in our calculations[53].",0
"However, when LMP was determined to be unreliable, we calculated gestational age at delivery using data from an ultrasound.",0
"Approximately 6% of the gestational age estimates came from ultrasounds in the last trimester, which have higher rates of estimate error than estimates calculated in early pregnancy.",0
"Finally, we were not able to obtain information on previous pregnancy outcomes; previous history of PTB or abortion in the second trimester has been associated with an increased frequency of PTB[54].",0
"Despite these limitations, the strengths of our study include having access to birth outcomes from medical records as well as having available influenza surveillance data.",0
"Studies suggest that the effect of influenza vaccination on birth outcomes may be better observed during high influenza circulation period, and there was a substantial influenza circulation in Nicaragua in 2014[20],[21],[55].",0
"Furthermore, the propensity score analyses minimized biases introduced by differences in baseline characteristics between unvaccinated and vaccinated pregnant women by accounting for the probability of vaccination based on these characteristics[43].",0
We were also able to perform sensitivity analysis for self-reported vaccination.,0
"Moreover, we used international standards to define the variable small for gestational age[36]and validated it with a World Health Organization calculator to estimate SGA[56]; results were consistent for both (data not shown).",0
"In summary, we found some evidence of a protective effect of influenza vaccination by trimester on birth outcomes; however, we encourage further investigation by prioritizing prospective cohort designs over retrospective studies to minimize selection and recall biases.",0
"In addition, it may be helpful for countries to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices of influenza vaccination recommendations among health personnel, especially in countries where influenza vaccination recommendations and practices have recently been implemented or expanded.",0
Gestational exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals in relation to infant birth weight: a Bayesian analysis of the HOME Study\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nPregnant women are exposed to a mixture of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs).,0
"Gestational EDC exposures may be associated with changes in fetal growth that elevates the risk for poor health later in life, but few studies have examined the health effects of simultaneous exposure to multiple chemicals.",0
"This study aimed to examine the association of gestational exposure to five chemical classes of potential EDCs: phthalates and bisphenol A, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) with infant birth weight.",0
"Conclusion\nGestational exposure to phthalates, PFAS, PCBs, PBDEs, OCPs or OPPs had null or small associations with birth weight.",0
"Gestational OPP, Pb, and PFAS exposures were most strongly associated with lower birth weight.",0
"The vulnerability of the developing fetus [15] coupled with the pervasive nature of EDCs has raised concerns about reproductive health effects arising from gestational EDC exposure, such as low birth weight [15].",0
"Low birth weight is a predictor for coronary heart disease [16], diabetes mellitus [17] and infant mortality [17].",0
"Additionally, some previously published studies [14,15] found associations between gestational EDC exposure and birth weight.",0
Understanding the role EDCs may play in affecting birth weight will inform efforts to prevent low birth weight and the development of chronic diseases.,0
Many investigators have explored the relationship between EDC exposures and birth weight [18].,0
"examined the relationships between 16 chemicals (6 phthalates, 8 PFAS, 2 PCBs and 1 OCP) and birth weight using Elastic Net Regression analyses; 2 phthalates, 1 PFAS, and 1 OCP were associated with lower birth weight [18].",0
"Using a job exposure matrix, which can differ from exposure measurement, Birks et al.",0
(2016) examined occupational EDC exposures in a meta-analysis of European birth cohorts and found that pregnant women exposed to more than 1 EDC class were more likely to have a low birth weight infant [15].,0
"There is sufficient evidence that increased PFAS (especially PFOA) exposure is associated with low birth weight [18–20], but mixed results are reported for other EDCs and birth weight [18,21].",0
"(2016), found an association between PCB 153 and low birth weight [21] whereas Lenters et al.",0
[18] did not find an association.,0
"Similar inconsistent associations exist for phthalates and BPA [22–24], OCPs [18,25] and PBDEs [26,27].",0
These inconsistencies may be due to a shortage of statistical tools to explore the effects of multiple chemical exposure mixtures on birth weight.,0
One way to model multi-exposure mixtures is to collapse the exposures into a summary term that is included in regression models for the outcome [28] or use proxy variables [29].,0
"These approaches, however, assign equal weight and importance to all chemicals, irrespective of their predictive value.",0
"Multivariable linear regression [5,13,24] with selected predictors [30] is another method, but it can produce unreliable estimates due to the highly correlated nature of some EDCs [31].",0
LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) [30] and Elastic Net are more sophisticated multivariable linear modeling methods that have been used for analyzing multiple correlated exposure variables.,0
Bayesian hierarchical linear models (BHLMs) are one possible solution to analyzing the effect of multiple correlated exposures [32].,0

Using 50% CIs gives higher power to detect small effects in the data and they can serve as a screening tool for identifying weak effects that may warrant further study [33].,0
"However, a limitation of 50% CIs when used for multiple frequentist hypothesis tests is that they have a higher Type I error rate than using alpha level = 0.05.",0
"Additionally, to better understand the impact of the BHLM shrinkage on the regression coefficients, we re-analyzed the data using both LASSO and Elastic Net.",0
"Note that confidence intervals for beta coefficients from LASSO and Elastic Net are not available using standard software, and calculating standard errors for parameter estimates is challenging because the shrinkage estimation produces biased estimates for large coefficients.",0
"Several maternal demographic characteristics predicted birth weight, including age, race, marital status, annual household income, public or no insurance and other SES variables.",0
Tobacco smoke exposure also predicted lower birth weight with a 210 g reduction among smoking mothers (>3 ng/ml serum cotinine) compared with non-smoking mothers (<3 ng/ml serum cotinine).,0
"With few exceptions (e.g., PFOA), median concentrations among HOME Study participants tended to be similar to concentrations observed in US women (Table2).",0
"Individual chemicals within a class tended to be positively correlated with each other, particularly for persistent compounds like PCBs and PBDEs (Additional file1: Figure S2 [43]).",0
"Phthalates and BPA were less strongly correlated with other chemicals and, with the exception of the di-2-ethylhexylphthalate metabolites, weakly correlated with each other.",0
"The σβposterior mean was 10 g, which indicated heterogeneity in the phthalate and BPA effects around this estimate, and that roughly two thirds of the beta coefficients were within 10 g (one standard deviation) of μβ.",0
"In contrast, for PFAS exposure, the μβand σβposterior means were larger in magnitude and equal to -11 g, 95% CI (-52, 34) and 24 g, respectively.",0
"Finally, OCP exposure was associated with a μβof 7 g, 95% CI (-25, 99) with an estimated σβof 18 g.\nWe examined associations between individual EDCs and birth weight to understand which individual EDCs within a class drive the value of μβ, given by the posterior distribution of the BHLM regression coefficients βx1... βxp(see Figs.1and2).",0
"In the phthalates and BPA class, there was a 9 g birth weight increase in response to a 10-fold increase exposure to MEOHP, and a 10-fold increase in MEHP exposure was associated with a 7 g decrease in birth weight.",0
"None of the individual phthalate metabolites or BPA were statistically significant at the 0.05 or 0.5 level, which may explain why the class as a whole was not significantly different from zero.",0
"In contrast, all 5 PFAS were associated with reductions in birth weight, although none of the 95% CIs excluded zero.",0
"PFHXS exhibited the largest association in the BHLM with a 10-fold exposure increase associated with a 17 g birth weight decrease, whereas PFNA was the weakest predictor of birth weight.",0
PCBs ranged from an 8 g birth weight increase associated with a 10-fold increase of PCB 105 to a 7 g decrease associated with a 10-fold increase in PCB 199.,0
The large number of 23 PCBs examined in this study meant that the BHLM performed more aggressive shrinkage on the model regression coefficients for this class.,0
"Of the 9 PBDEs, a 10-fold increase in PBDE 17 was associated with the greatest birth weight increase (12 g) while PBDE 153 was associated with the greatest decrease (23 g).",0
"The largest increase in the OCP class was seen with a 10-fold increase in HCH exposure (5 g), while the largest birth weight decrease was seen in response to a 10-fold increase in Nonachlor exposure (10 g).",0
"DMP exposure was associated with a 57 g reduction in birth weight (95% CI (-123, 10), 50% CI (-79, -34)).",0
"Blood lead concentration was associated with a 45 g decrease in birth weight (95% CI (-110, 22), 50% CI (-68, -22)), while mercury exposure was associated with a 5 g, 95%CI (-56, 66) increase in birth weight.",0
"The LASSO regression coefficients tended to be larger in magnitude than BHLM with wider and less precise 95% intervals, which we expected because LASSO does not use shrinkage that borrows information between chemicals within a particular class.",0
Our Elastic Net analysis identified 1 EDC in common with Lenters et al.,0
"In Lenters, this EDC was associated with a -0.15 g difference in birth weight, which was attenuated after adjusting for gestational age.",0
"In our analysis, MEOHP was associated with a 13 g birth weight increase (Additional file1: Figure S3).",0
"Additionally, Pb was associated with a 58 g decrease in birth weight in the LASSO analysis (Additional file1: Figure S3) and a 53 g decrease in the Elastic Net analysis (Additional file1: Figure S4).",0
"DEP, one OPP, was associated with a 16 g birth weight increase using LASSO (Additional file1: Figure S3) and DMP, the other OPP, was associated with a 48 g decrease (Additional file1: Figure S3).",0
"In the Elastic Net analysis, DEP was associated with a 21 g increase and DMP with a 54g decrease in birth weight (Additional file1: Figure S4).",0
"Because LASSO and Elastic Net do not estimate the μβparameter, this makes Additional file1: Figures S2 and S3 harder to interpret because they do not estimate the average association between the exposure variables and the outcome within a chemical class.",0
"GA is a potential mediating variable on the causal pathway between EDC exposure and birth weight, while sex is a potential modifier.",0
Controlling for mediators may attenuate the total effect of EDCs on birth weight.,0
"While the results are mostly unchanged, the phthalates and BPA exposures were associated with a decrease in birth weight for male infants compared to the combined analysis (3 g decrease compared with 1 g increase).",0
The decrease in male birth weight associated with Pb exposure was roughly double the associated birth weight decrease in the combined analysis (94 g decrease compared with 45 g decrease).,0
There are some potentially interesting differences in the impact of DEP and DMP on birth weight when the study sample is stratified by infant sex.,0
"While DEP was associated with a 14 g increase in birth weight in the combined analysis, it was associated with a 51 g increase in males and a 9 g decrease in females in the sex stratified analysis.",0
"DMP in the combined analysis was associated with a 57 g decrease in birth weight; looking at the stratified analysis revealed that this decrease is greater in magnitude for male infants (88 g decrease), and lesser in female infants (27 g decrease).",0
The associations of greater magnitude present in male infants correspond with previously published studies [24].,0
Discussion\nIn this study we examined the relationship between gestational exposure to 53 different EDCs and birth weight in a prospective birth cohort of mother-infant pairs.,0
"We found that exposure to phthalates and BPA, PFAS, PCBs, PBDEs or OCPs had null or small associations with birth weight.",0
"Other investigators have reported similar small or statistically non-significant associations between birth weight and phthalates [37], PCBs [15], PBDEs [13], and OCPs [25].",0
"Several other studies, however, have found associations between increased exposure to phthalates, PCBs, PBDEs or OCPs whereas we did not.",0
[24] revealed that low birth weight infants in China tended to have much higher meconium phthalate levels than infants who were normal weight.,0
[21] reported that increased exposure to PCBs was associated with decreased birth weight.,0
[27] found a statistically significant inverse association between PBDE exposure and birth weight.,0
[18] both found changes in birth weight associated with increased OCP exposure.,0
"We found some evidence that PFAS, DMP and Pb were associated with small reductions in birth weight.",0
"On average, a 10-fold increase in exposure to the PFAS class was associated with an -11 g change in birth weight, 50% CI (-21, -2).",0
"However, due to the higher Type I error rate associated with using alpha level = 0.5, this association should be interpreted with caution.",0
"Similar findings concerning PFAS exposure have been reported elsewhere [5,19].",0
"While the exact mechanism by which PFAS impact birth weight is unknown, several theories have been proposed.",0
One explanation is that PFAS interact with estrogen receptors and disrupt hormonal balances [20].,0
"Additionally, PFAS alter human [20] and animal [3] serum lipid levels, potentially affecting fetal growth and development.",0
"Finally, PFAS affect adipose tissue development and the regulatory systems involved in body weight homeostasis, which may impact fetal growth outcomes [20], including those that occur after birth such as infant mortality or cardiovascular disease which are beyond the scope of this study [16,17].",0
"A 10-fold increase in Pb exposure was associated with a 45 g birth weight reduction (50% CI (-68, -22), while increased exposure to DMP was associated with a -57 g (50% CI(-79, -34)) change in birth weight.",0
"Both of these findings, as with the PFAS findings, should be interpreted cautiously because alpha = 0.5.",0
"They do, however, agree with previously published studies [14,39,45,46].",0
Having many exposure variables complicates the interpretation of associations between the 5 EDC classes and birth weight when using traditional multi-variable linear methods.,0
There were several limitations to the study.,0
"First, the BHLM model did not account for interactions between classes, and we assumed that all chemicals within a class share a similar mode of action and arise from a common prior distribution.",0
"Second, the model also excluded non-linear relationships, including potential threshold effects that could yield important information about the relationships between EDC exposure and birth weight.",0
"BHLM, because it is a shrinkage method, is also prone to higher Type II errors.",0
Non-persistent chemicals exhibit larger degrees of measurement error.,0
"For example, phthalates metabolites and BPA have short half-lives and this may have attenuated regression estimates and reduced statistical power [48].",0
"To reduce exposure misclassification, we pooled the exposures at 16 and 26 weeks [40].",0
"Lastly, we conducted these analyses under the assumption that structurally similar chemicals would have similar modes of action and therefore should be grouped together.",0
"Other grouping schemes, however, may be more informative.",0
Conclusion\nThis paper introduces BHLM as a method for tackling multiple correlated exposures in relation to health outcomes and compared this method with LASSO and Elastic Net.,0
LASSO and Elastic Net regression coefficients were larger in size but with less precise 95% intervals compared to BHLM.,0
Statistical theory demonstrates that the estimators have smaller mean squared error than ordinary least squares estimators [51].,0
BHLM also has the advantage that it yields estimates of the hyperparameters that aid in interpreting the effects of multiple correlated exposures.,0
"We showed that gestational exposure to phthalates and BPA, PCBs, PBDEs or OCPs had small or null associations with differences in birth weight.",0
"In contrast, and consistent with previous studies, PFAS, Pb, and OPP exposures were more strongly associated with reduced birth weight [19,39,45,46].",0
"Maternal vitamin D status, gestational diabetes and infant birth size\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nMaternal vitamin D status has been associated with both gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and fetal growth restriction, however, the evidence is inconsistent.",0
"In Finland, maternal vitamin D status has improved considerably due to national health policies.",0
"Our objective was to compare maternal 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentrations [25(OH)D] between mothers with and without GDM, and to investigate if an association existed between maternal vitamin D concentration and infant birth size.",0
Regression analysis confirmed no association between oral glucose tolerance test results and maternal 25(OH)D ( P \u2009>\u20090.53).,0
"However, mothers with optimal UCB 25(OH)D had newborns with smaller head circumference than those with suboptimal 25(OH)D ( P \u2009=\u20090.003), which was further confirmed as a linear association ( P \u2009=\u20090.024).",0
Conclusions\nMaternal vitamin D concentration was similar in mothers with and without GDM in a mostly vitamin D sufficient population.,0
Associations between maternal vitamin D status and birth size were inconsistent.,0
"A sufficient maternal vitamin D status, specified as 25(OH)D above 50\xa0nmol/L, may be a threshold above which the physiological requirements of pregnancy are achieved.",0
"Background\nVitamin D deficiency, defined as a circulating 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration below 50\xa0nmol/L, has been common among Finnish pregnant women [1].",0
"However, due to recent changes in national health policies, intake of vitamin D has increased resulting in decreasing rates of vitamin D deficiency [2–5].",0
"Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [6], but the evidence is inconsistent [7,8].",0
"Of all pregnancies, 1–14% are affected by GDM [9], and globally GDM prevalence has been increasing in line with increasing obesity [10].",0
GDM is the most common pregnancy complication in Europe [11].,0
"In Finland, the prevalence of GDM has increased from 6% in 2008 to 11% in 2014 [12].",0
"GDM increases the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, and the risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in later life both of the mother and the child [13].",0
Fetal growth may have later health implications also within the normal-birth-weight range [14].,0
Poor maternal vitamin D status has been related to fetal growth restriction [15] but it is unknown whether maternal vitamin D status associates with birth size in infants with normal birth weight.,0
"Many of the findings regarding the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and GDM are based on case-control studies, which may include a potential selection bias.",0
"Case-control studies often focus on high-risk groups, for example women who are overweight and sedentary, which are independent risk factors for vitamin D deficiency as well (for example [16]).",0
"The objectives of the present study were to compare 25(OH)D concentration at two consecutive time points between mothers with and without GDM, and to investigate associations between maternal factors and infant’s birth size, and the potential role of 25(OH)D concentration therein.",0
We employed UCB 25(OH)D to reflect both the maternal vitamin D status at the end of pregnancy and the newborn’s vitamin D status at birth [1].,0
"We defined vitamin D deficiency as 25(OH)D\u2009<\u200950\xa0nmol/L, and vitamin D sufficiency as 25(OH)D\u2009≥\u200950\xa0nmol/L, since a concentration of ≥50\xa0nmol/L is considered sufficient for bone health [17].",0
"Suboptimal vitamin D status was defined as 25(OH)D\u2009<\u200980\xa0nmol/L, and optimal vitamin D status as 25(OH)D\u2009≥\u200980\xa0nmol/L, as has been suggested based on calcium absorption studies [18].",0
"Total GWG was categorised into inadequate, adequate and excessive based on national recommendations by prepregnancy BMI: recommended GWG for underweight mothers was 12.5–18.0\xa0kg, for normal weight 11.5–16.0\xa0kg, for overweight 7.0–11.5\xa0kg, and for obese 5.0–9.0\xa0kg [19].",0
"Education was re-categorised into ‘lower’ and ‘higher’ education (lower\u2009=\u2009lower or upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education, higher\u2009=\u2009first or second stage of tertiary education), due to a low number of subjects in other education categories.",0
These data and the duration of pregnancy were retrospectively collected from birth records.,0
Assessment of GDM\nThe diagnosis of GDM was based on a two-hour 75\xa0g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).,0
"According to the national guidelines, GDM was diagnosed if the OGTT results exceeded cut-offs for one or more values: fasting plasma glucose ≥5.3\xa0mmol/l, 1-h\u2009≥\u200910.0\xa0mmol/l and 2-h\u2009≥\u20098.6\xa0mmol/l [19].",0
"In general, screening for GDM depends on a presence of risk factors according to national recommendations [19] and based on these, OGTT was performed on 490 (54.5%) of the participating mothers.",0
Season with four categories affected maternal 25(OH)D concentrations.,0
The data included partially missing information.,0
Imputation of missing values for education ( n \u2009=\u200912) and parity ( n \u2009=\u20092) were conducted using the median value in subgroups by GDM status.,0
Missing data on prepregnancy smoking as number of cigarettes daily were imputed as a median value (= zero) by GDM status according to smoking status ( n \u2009=\u200922).,0
Imputation of missing values for GWG at 12 gestational weeks was conducted using a mean value of two consecutive measurements ( n \u2009=\u200912).,0
Missing values of other variables were not imputed.,0
"Majority (95%) of the mothers took vitamin D supplements during pregnancy, most of them were highly educated (75% had at least a bachelor level education), and 73% had normal weight before pregnancy.",0
"No differences between the groups were observed in several other characteristics, including GWG, duration of gestation, and supplemental vitamin D intake.",0
We investigated whether pregnancy 25(OH)D concentration differed between mothers with ( n \u2009=\u200981) and without GDM ( n \u2009=\u2009639) (Fig.,0
"Adjusted analysis confirmed no difference in mean\u2009±\u2009SEM pregnancy 25(OH)D concentration between GDM and non-GDM mothers (81.7\u2009±\u20092.3 vs 81.7\u2009±\u20090.8\xa0nmol/L, P \u2009=\u20090.99).",0
"Similarly in UCB, the adjusted analysis showed no difference in 25(OH)D concentrations in infants born to women with and without GDM (79.1\u2009±\u20092.3 vs 80.1\u2009±\u20090.8\xa0nmol/L, P \u2009=\u20090.69) (Fig.1).",0
"These results remained when only those who had undergone OGTT were included: pregnancy and UCB 25(OH)D concentrations were similar in GDM ( n \u2009=\u200980) and non-GDM mothers ( n \u2009=\u2009323) ( P \u2009=\u20090.94 and P \u2009=\u20090.43, respectively).",0
Maternal 25(OH)D concentrations were similar between non-GDM and GDM mothers.,0
"Abbreviations: 25(OH)D, 25-hydroxy vitamin D; UCB, umbilical cord blood; GDM, gestational diabetes mellitus\nWe further tested for possible associations between pregnancy 25(OH)D concentration and OGTT results with a univariate regression model.",0
"The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D\u2009<\u200950\xa0nmol/L] during pregnancy was similar between mothers with or without GDM [4.9% (4/81) vs 3.3% (21/642), P \u2009=\u20090.51].",0
"However, more GDM mothers were vitamin D deficient at the delivery compared with non-GDM mothers [7.4% (6/81) vs 2.8% (18/642) ( P \u2009=\u20090.042)].",0
"However, of these six deficient GDM-mothers five (83%) were smokers, and correspondingly in non-GDM mothers four out of eighteen were smokers (24%) ( P \u2009=\u20090.018).",0
Maternal 25(OH)D and newborn birth size\nThe effect of maternal factors on birth size in fully adjusted models is presented in Table\xa02and Fig.,0
"As compared to mothers with suboptimal pregnancy 25(OH)D, mothers with optimal pregnancy 25(OH)D had heavier newborns ( P \u2009=\u20090.010), but this positive association was not verified in linear regression (B 0.00; 95% CI -0.00, 0.01; P\u2009= \xa00.16).",0
Newborn head circumference was larger in those with suboptimal UBC 25(OH)D compared with mothers with optimal UCB 25(OH)D ( P \u2009=\u20090.003).,0
"Further, linear regression confirmed the inverse association between UCB 25(OH)D and head circumference (B -1.74; 95% CI -3.25, −0.23; P\u2009= \xa00.024).",0
"These results did not change after adjusting for mode of delivery (vaginal, vacuum assisted or caesarean section).",0
"Prepregnancy BMI, GWG, and parity had independent effects on birth size (Table2and Fig.2).",0
"Abbreviations: GWG, gestational weight gain; GDM, gestational diabetes mellitus; 25(OH)D, 25-hydroxy vitamin D; suboptimal, UCB, umbilical cord blood; 25(OH)D\u2009<\u200980\xa0nmol/L; optimal 25(OH)D\u2009≥\u200980\xa0nmol/L\n\nDiscussion\nThe primary focus of this work was to determine whether 25(OH)D concentration differs between mothers with and without GDM, and whether vitamin D status affects birth size in normal-birth-weight infants.",0
"Almost all mother-child pairs (97%) were vitamin D sufficient [25(OH)D\u2009≥\u200950\xa0nmol/L], and about half of the mother-child pairs had optimal vitamin D status [25(OH)D\u2009≥\u200980\xa0nmol/L].",0
Maternal 25(OH)D concentrations were similar in GDM and non-GDM mothers.,0
"Interestingly, pregnancy vitamin D status associated positively with birth weight, but an inverse association was observed between newborn vitamin D status and head circumference at birth.",0
(2016) concluded in their meta-analysis that maternal vitamin D insufficiency (< 50\xa0nmol/L or <75\xa0nmol/L) was associated with greater risk of GDM [6].,0
"However, they suggested that this applied only in developed countries and when no adjustments for confounders were made [6].",0
"In our study, maternal vitamin D concentrations were similar in non-GDM and GDM mothers, and there was no linear association between vitamin D concentrations and OGTT results.",0
"However, we observed that vitamin D deficiency at delivery was more prevalent in mothers with GDM compared with non-GDM mothers, but this was not marked during pregnancy.",0
"This finding was possibly confounded by smoking, which was more prevalent in the deficient GDM mothers compared with deficient non-GDM mothers.",0
Nevertheless due to small number of deficient mothers we could not investigate this reliably.,0
"In accordance with other studies, our results imply that in a vitamin D sufficient population, the association between 25(OH)D and GDM may not exist [8,21,22].",0
"Similarly, Josefson et al.",0
"(2016) stated that maternal fasting glucose or GDM status was not associated with pregnancy 25(OH)D, which in their study was on average 93\xa0nmol/L [23].",0
"GDM is a multifactorial disease involving various risk factors, for example lifestyle factors, obesity, rapid weight gain and predisposing genetic factors.",0
"Furthermore, some of these factors are related to or co-exist with poor vitamin D status [24,25], which further increases the challenge when dissecting independent effect.",0
"It is possible that in previous studies where no adjustment for confounding factors was performed, the association between 25(OH)D and GDM reflects shared factors such as an unhealthy lifestyle or adiposity [26].",0
"Yet, contrary to many studies, associations between high 25(OH)D and GDM have been reported [27,28].",0
"Although a biological mechanism between low vitamin D status and diabetes is plausible [29], only a few interventions have been conducted, and these have not proved an effect of vitamin D supplementation on risk of GDM [30].",0
"Maternal vitamin D status associated with birth size: pregnancy 25(OH)D showed a positive association towards birth weight, but UCB 25(OH)D an inverse association with head circumference, while only the inverse association with head circumference was verified with linear model.",0
(2014) concluded that modest evidence exist for a positive relation between maternal vitamin D status and birth weight [31].,0
"Some earlier studies have shown that severe maternal vitamin D deficiency associates with smaller head circumference at birth [32,33], yet some have not [34,35].",0
"In agreement with our findings, others have discovered that mothers with higher vitamin D concentration have infants with smaller head circumference at birth [36,37].",0
"However, the clinical relevance, if any, of the inverse relationship between maternal vitamin D status and head circumference at birth remains unexplained.",0
"It is unknown whether this reflects differences in brain size or in skull bones’ structure, and needs to be explored in future studies.",0
A possible explanation for this might be a U-shaped association between maternal vitamin D concentration and fetal outcomes in a population with sufficient vitamin D status.,0
We have previously suggested the U-shaped association between 25(OH)D concentration and inflammatory biomarkers in cord blood [5].,0
We have collected a homogenous cohort of Caucasian mothers from the capital region of Finland representing mothers without regular medication and their newborns who were born at term with normal birth weight.,0
"In many previous studies, participants had various ethnic backgrounds which could affect both vitamin D status and their risk of GDM [7,38].",0
"A strength of the present study lies in the recruitment of subjects, which took place in a single hospital, enabled standardised data collection and covered all seasons.",0
"However, a multi-centre study might have resulted in a wider variety of socio-economic backgrounds.",0
"A challenge in previous studies on vitamin D status and GDM has been the lack of relevant adjustments, for example adjustments for BMI and smoking status [6].",0
"In the present study, we have systematically investigated confounders between groups, and adjusted for those when applicable.",0
"The threshold for defining vitamin D deficiency and the diagnostic criteria for GDM vary between studies, which might affect the results and complicate the comparison of studies.",0
"A further limitation is that the OGTT was not performed on all mothers, and a slight possibility exists that the actual prevalence of GDM might be underestimated.",0
"Yet, our main results were repeated in a subgroup analysis of only those women to whom an OGTT was performed.",0
"In addition, the prevalence of GDM was in accordance with the national statistics [12].",0
"However, in a cross-sectional setting causal relationships cannot be determined.",0
"Conclusion\nIn summary, maternal vitamin D concentration was similar in mothers with and without GDM in a vitamin D sufficient population.",0
"Furthermore, we found an inverse association between UCB 25(OH)D and infant head circumference.",0
The clinical relevance of this finding remains unsolved and needs to be considered in future studies.,0
"Sufficient maternal vitamin D status, specified as 25(OH)D above 50\xa0nmol/L, seems a threshold value, above which the physiological requirements of pregnancy are achieved.",0
Our findings suggest that an adequate maternal vitamin status have been achieved in Finland.,0
"However, randomised controlled trials are required in specific risk groups of vitamin D deficiency to clarify if vitamin D supplementation affects the risk of GDM.",0

"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer (with 2,400 cases diagnosed each year in those under age 20) and the second most common cause of mortality in children aged 1–14.",1
Recent research has confirmed that ALL can originate in utero .,1
New findings from the NIEHS-funded Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study (NCCLS) show that the disease may originate even earlier—in the foods a woman eats before she even becomes pregnant.,1
"The effect of maternal diet on child leukemia risk has not been rigorously studied; the few studies that have been done have focused on specific dietary factors, and the results have been mixed.",1
It is the first study to capture mothers’ overall dietary patterns and relate them to child leukemia.,1
"The researchers found that the more vegetables, fruits, and proteins a woman ate, the lower the risk of her child having leukemia.",1
"Of the vegetables and fruits, carrots and cantaloupe showed the highest inverse effect, perhaps because of these foods’ high carotenoid content.",1
String beans and peas also correlated inversely with ALL risk.,1
"Among the proteins, beef and beans—both sources of the antioxidant glutathione—showed the highest inverse effect.",1
"The authors stress that dietary factors work together, and no one food should be singled out in attributing risk or benefit.",1
"Further, a cause-and-effect relationship can not be concluded from this study.",1
"However, they write, it remains prudent for women who are pregnant or think they may become pregnant to eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables.",1
Lesions of testis and epididymis associated with prenatal diethylstilbestrol exposure.,1
The main aim was to study factors identified in a previous study as potentially causally related to cancer of the oesophagus.,1
"Other tumours (lung, stomach, breast, large bowel, larynx and pharynx) were included to distinguish findings specific for oesophageal cancer from general characteristics of cancer patients, due for example to ascertainment bias, and to verify that expected associations, such as between lung cancer and cigarette smoking, would emerge under the prevailing field conditions.",1
"The use of opium, bread and tea could not be assessed in the retrospective framework.",1
Strongly associated with risk of oesophageal cancer were low socio-economic status and low intake of fresh fruit and vegetables.,1
"The two factors each had an independent effect, and were more marked for oesophageal cancer than for the other tumours.",1
Recent nationwide shortages of low-calcium formula (LCF) suggest this problem may be widespread.,1
CYP24A1 mutations have been identified as a potential cause of IIH.,1
"To determine if IIH is occurring more commonly, de-identified, first-measured serum calcium from all infants <6 months (n=5796) measured in our laboratory, were grouped by years 2005-2007 (n=1516), 2008-2010 (n=1945) and 2011-2013 (n=2335).",1
"PTH was not elevated (median 1.0pmol/L [<0.3-3.1]), urinary calcium: creatinine ratio not suppressed (median 2.3, [0.4-9]), 25OHVitD low-normal (median 44nmol/L [17-218]) and 1,25(OH)2VitD elevated (median 232pmol/L [64-720]), in keeping with an abnormality in CYP24A1.",1
"In 7/10 infants with data available, treated with LCF for median 95 days (range 25-310), median PTH rose to 17.1pmol/L ([8.2-49.3], P=0.02) with a trend to lower 25OHVit D (median 23nmol/L [<10-108], P=0.09) despite continued high-normal calcium levels (median 2.66mmol/L [2.11-2.75]).",1
Concurrent changes in rates of hyper and hypo-calcaemia suggest antenatal vitamin D3supplementation as an aetiological factor.,1
"IIH was associated with significant morbidity, including symptomatic hypercalcaemia and nephrocalcinosis.",1
"Treatment with LCF prevented further symptomatic hypercalcaemia, but resulted in elevated PTH.",1
The biochemistry of our patients with IIH raises variations in Vitamin D metabolism or calcium set-point as potential associated factors.,1
Nutrition for the primary care provider\nThis book focuses on the various nutritional aspects of the current needs of the society at large and for the health practitioners.,1
"It would have been worthwhile to include some more topics such as management of severely acute malnutrition, examples of high, low and moderate glycaemic index foods, how to read food labels (with examples), etc and also additional references for further reading would have been beneficial as the chapters are a quick guide to appraise the topic.",1
Visfatin as a predictor for growth of fetus and infant\n\nAbstract\n\nObjective:\nVisfatin is an adipocytokine that functions as an enzyme and a growth factor to investigate the relationship between serum visfatin and the fetus’s anthropometric markers up to a year after birth.,1
"In group A, there was a strong positive relationship between birth head circumference and the first (p1=0.054, r1=0.580) and second trimester visfatin levels (p2=0.051, r2=0.530).",1
"In group B, second trimester visfatin levels correlated negatively with birth length (p=0.015, r=-0.523) and infant’s head circumference (p2=0.050, r2=-0.392).",1
"In a separate study on group B, visfatin levels in the first and second trimesters showed a significant negative correlation with infant’s weight.",1
"A significant correlation was observed between the first and second trimesters visfatin level with infant’s height in both groups, such that this relationship was positive in group A and negative in group B.",1
Linear regression analysis revealed that first and second trimester visfatin levels were significant independent predictors of infant’s weight in group B and infant’s height in both groups.,1
Second trimester visfatin level was a significant predictor of birth height in group B.,1
"Conclusion:\nMaternal serum visfatin level shows a relationship with fetal and infant anthropometric indicators, with different effects in the two groups, suggesting visfatin dysfunction in the overweight group before pregnancy.",1
"PRECIS: We measured the serum visfatin level in pregnancy, and assess its relationship with the children’s anthropometric markers, to determine if it can be used as biomarker.",1
"Introduction\nBy releasing adipokines, adipose tissue has a major role in fertility, and physical and sexual maturation(1).",1
"Visfatin, a new 52KDa adipokine(2), was renamed to nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (Nampt) in 2002 after it was shown that it encodes an enzyme called Nampt, which is involved in the conversion of nicotinamide into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)(3).",1
"Yet, visfatin’s regulatory and release mechanisms in the fetus and neonate are still unclear(5).",1
"It is probably regulated by glucose and insulin(6), and increases with gradual degradation of B-cell and progress of insulin-resistance and maternal weight(7).",1
Many studies have shown that increased visfatin levels in maternal plasma are associated with small-for-gestantional-age births(8)and intrauterine growth restriction(9).,1
"Strong relationships have recently been reported between serum visfatin levels in the first trimester of pregnancy and insulin secretion in the fetus and final birth weight, which shows the role of visfatin secretion in early pregnancy in the later metabolic modeling of the fetus(11).",1
These results suggest that visfatin may play an important role in maternal-fetal metabolic interaction.,1
"However, due to the lack of sufficient information about the physiologic role of visfatin in adults, its source and regulation mechanism in fetal and neonatal stages cannot be argued absolutely.",1
"To investigate the role of visfatin in the growth of the fetus and up to a year after birth, we measured serum visfatin levels during 6-12 and 15-20 weeks of gestation in an Iranian population.",1
"The relationship between visfatin level and neonatal anthropometric indicators at birth\nIn group A, a strong positive relationship was observed between birth head circumference and the first (p1=0.05, r1=0.580) and second trimester visfatin levels (p2=0.051, r2=0.530).",1
"Spearman Rank correlation test showed a negative significant relationship between second trimester visfatin level and birth height (p=0.015, r=-0.523) in group B (Table 2).",1
Linear regression analysis revealed that the second trimester visfatin level was a significant predictor of birth height in group B (Table 3).,1
"Significant correlations were observed in both groups between first trimester visfatin (pa=0.002, ra=0.713, pb=0.005, rb=-0.540, in A and B group, respectively) and second trimester visfatin (pa=0.009, ra=0.628 and pb=0.008, rb=-0.518, in groups A and B, respectively) with infant’s height.",1
This correlation was positive in group A and negative in group B.,1
"According to the Lambda test, this correlation was significantly greater in group A than in group B (p<0.05).",1
"A negative and significant correlation was separately found between infant’s weight and the first (p1=0.024, r1=-0.450) and second trimester visfatin levels (p2=0.005, r2=-0.540) in group B.",1
"Generally, the relationship between visfatin and the infants’s growth indicators was positive in group A and negative in group B.",1
"A strong negative correlation was separately found between the second trimester visfatin level and infant’s head circumference (p2=0.05, r2=-0.392) in group B (Table 2).",1
Linear regression analysis revealed that first and second trimester visfatin levels were significant predictors of infant’s weight in group B and infant’s height in both groups (Table 3).,1
Discussion\nNo study has yet been conducted to assess the relationship between maternal serum visfatin and neonatal anthropometric indicators by categorizing mothers based on BMI.,1
The visfatin regulation mechanism in human fetal blood circulation is unknown(12).,1
"However, recent studies have proposed the presence of a relationship between maternal serum visfatin level and fetal growth.",1
"A strong relationship was found between maternal serum visfatin and neonatal anthropometric indicators in groups A and B, with a possible mechanism of maternal visfatin entering the fetal blood circulation through the placenta as a result of endocrine changes.",1
"Moreover, umbilical cord serum visfatin concentrations were found to have a positive relationship with insulin levels(13).",1
Mazaki-Tovi analyzed the relationship of increased maternal serum visfatin with gestational diabetes mellitus infection and the birth of LGA infants.,1
One of the reasons for a visfatin effect on fetal development is its effect on sirtuins (SIRT).,1
"SIRTs are a class of\xa0proteins\xa0that have a role in cellular processes associated with body metabolism such as cell differentiation, aging,\xa0transcription,\xa0apoptosis,\xa0inflammation,\xa0and stress resistance, as well as energy efficiency and alertness during\xa0low-calorie situations.",1
"SIRT 1 (SIRT1) affects chromatin modulation, and therefore suppresses transcription and interacts with transcription factors, and is capable of positive or negative regulation of gene expression(15).",1
"Through involvement in NAD+synthesis needed for SIRT activity, visfatin has a major role in the regulation of SIRT1-dependent transcription, and this leads to the metabolism of energy and differentiation of stem cells.",1
"This means that Nampt promotes osteocyte differentiation through a pathway mediated by SIRT1(16,17).",1
High levels of SIRT1 expression in the human brain have been revealed(18).,1
"SIRTs have an important role in the process of synapse promotion and modulation of their strength, which is important for memory formation.",1
"During neuronal development, SIRT1 has a important role in promoting xonal elongation, neurite outgrowth, and dendritic branching via several targets and mechanisms(19).",1
The NAD+dependent deacetylase SIRT1 is implicated in energy balance regulation by its effect on pro-opiomelanocortin and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamusthis(20).,1
Obesity is correlated with low NAD+/SIRT pathway expression in adipose tissue of BMI-discordant monozygotic twins(22).,1
"The selective knock-out of SIRT1 in hypothalamic AgRP neurons diminished response to hunger-inducing hormone ghrelin, reduced food intake, consequently causing decreased lean mass and body weight(23).",1
"The persistence of the relationship between postpartum maternal serum visfatin levels and anthropometric indicators can be attributed to excretion of visfatin in mother’s milk, which was confirmed by Bienertová-Vašků et al.(25).",1
"Based on maternal colostrum visfatin levels, the aurors were able to predict neonatal weight loss in the first three days of birth(25,26).",1
"Visfatin by effect on the production of SIRT1, consequently, interference in the development of the brain and energy balance regulation may be associated with head circumferences and weights of fetus and child.",1
"According to these results, visfatin can have a major role in regulating neonatal obesity after birth.",1
The above studies confirm the present study results.,1
"Generally, these results show that visfatin has a major role in maternal-fetal metabolic interaction.",1
"Our results further show different metabolic regulations in groups A and B, which may be due to differences in expression of SIRT1, glucose transfer or insulin resistance as a result of resistance to glucose entry to fetal tissues for unknown reasons, which require further studies.",1
It is likely that visfatin can be used in the future as a biomarker predicting fetal and neonatal growth.,1
Study Limitations\nThis study provides useful data of the relationship between serum visfatin and the children’s anthropometric markers up to a year after birth.,1
"However, the present study has some limitations.",1
"First, we know that it would be better to evaluate levels of cord plasma and breast milk concentrations of visfatin and assess their correlation with the children’s anthropometric in order to support our results.",1
"However, we could not do it, which is a limitation of our study.",1
We suggest the long-term fallow up of mothers and infants with more abundant sample.,1
"Conclusion\nAfter a careful review of previous studies on visfatin and pregnancy, we can claim the present study is the first in Iran to have specifically addressed the relationship between maternal visfatin levels and infant’s anthropometric indicators up to a year after birth.",1
Our study can be the basis for further and more precise studies.,1
"According to the present study results, mean serum visfatin levels were higher in the second trimester compared with the first.",1
"In the present study, the relationship between prenatal visfatin level and infant’s anthropometric indicators in the two years following childbirth was assessed.",1
"Serum visfatin level appears to be related to the fetus and infant’s anthropometric indicators (infant’s weight, height and birth height.",1
First and second trimester visfatin levels were significant independent predictors of infant’s weight in group B and infant’s height in both groups.,1
"The second trimester visfatin level was a significant predictor of birth height in group B. Visfatin has extensive effects on pregnancy physiology and pathology, maternal and especially neonatal outcomes, and its effect is different in normal weight and overweight women.",1
"Hence, pre-pregnancy BMI appears to be a determining factor in creating the difference and the amount of maternal plasma visfatin during pregnancy, which can predict maternal serum visfatin and neonatal and maternal outcomes.",1
It is recommended that future studies be conducted with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods.,1
Results from an international case-control study of childhood brain tumors: the role of prenatal vitamin supplementation.,1
"Although risk estimates varied by study center, combined results suggest that maternal supplementation for two trimesters may decrease risk of brain tumor (odds ratio [OR] 0.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5-0.9), with a trend of less risk with longer duration of use (p trend = 0.0007).",1
"These findings are largely driven by data from the United States, where most mothers took vitamins.",1
"Mothers also took individual micronutrient supplements (e.g., vitamin C tablets), but most mothers who took these also took multivitamins, making it impossible to determine potential independent effects of these micronutrients.",1
Reproductive Toxicity: Too Much of a Good Thing?,1
"Pregnant women are famously exhorted to faithfully take their daily prenatal vitamins, which often contain iron and other minerals.",1
But new research suggests that a weekly iron supplement coinciding with the renewal of the small intestine’s mucosal lining cells (where nutrient absorption occurs) works better than a daily supplement and prevents problems resulting from too much iron at the wrong times.,1
"None of the women were anemic at that point, but 66% had low levels of ferritin (the principal form of stored iron), suggesting low iron nutritional status.",1
"Ironically, both early gestational iron-deficiency anemia and hemoconcentration later in pregnancy increase the risk of premature birth and low birth weight.",1
"Thus, the researchers suggest that excess iron supplementation can cause the same problems it is supposed to correct.",1
"Animal studies suggest that excess iron can also trigger formation of free radicals in the intestinal mucosa and other tissues, and that both iron deficiency and iron overload can damage nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA.",1
This kind of damage has been implicated in cancer induction.,1
"The intestinal mucosa is renewed every 5 to 6 days and will absorb as much iron as necessary to maintain iron balance; however, mature cells will stop absorbing iron entirely if they are flooded with it, even if there is an iron deficit.",1
"A more subtly calibrated iron supplementation during pregnancy may be as effective as current public health recommendations, and perhaps safer.",1
The Beat\n\nSavory Relief for Arsenic Poisoning?,1
"In the February 2008 issue of Food and Chemical Toxicology , researchers from India report that aqueous garlic extract (AGE) fed to at-risk individuals may reduce the toxic effects of arsenic.",1
"The researchers believe the antioxidant properties of garlic, along with the chelating efficacy exhibited, led to the success of the treatment.",1
In Utero Cigarette Smoke Exposure and Age at Menopause\nIt is well documented that women who smoke cigarettes begin menopause earlier than nonsmokers.,1
"Moreover, previously noted associations between current smoking and age at menopause were not observed among these women.",1
"These birds, which lived in northeastern Siberia, northern Alaska, and northern Greenland, are believed to have had no contact with humans.",1
"The researchers proposed three possible explanations for their findings: the birds could have been exposed to the bacteria through contact with other species of birds migrating from other regions, or resistance could have developed either through spontaneous mutations or through horizontal gene transfer from other microbes.",1
"This rule, the first of its kind in the world, will apply mainly to personal care products but also could apply to other categories such as food and textiles.",1
The group cites insufficient evidence on the impact of nanomaterials on the environment and human health.,1
"China Begins National Survey of Pollution Sources\nAlthough China has set goals to cut emissions of major pollutants, emissions of sulfur dioxide and some indicators of poor water quality increased in 2006.",1
Experts have decried the lack of trustworthy statistics on the sources and extent of pollution and the number of remediation facilities.,1
Ancient Chinese Cancer Secret?,1
"In the clinical trials, compounds from the venom have proven beneficial and caused no apparent side effects in patients with advanced liver, pancreatic, or lung cancer.",1
"Cardiac glycosides in the venom are thought to inhibit proteins that promote cancer cell growth, thereby causing cancer cell death.",1
"Although potentially toxic at high doses, these glycosides are used to treat congestive heart failure.",1
"Currently, the venom-based treatment is administered by injection, but the Texas researchers hope to develop a pill form.",1
Respond\nIn response to Prasad’s constructive comments on our quantitative meta-analysis of the estrogen hypothesis and testicular dysgenesis syndrome (Martin et al.,1
"2008), we offer the following observations regarding the scope of our study and limitations of the methodology applied.",1
"It cannot, however, correct for potential bias and confounding of the studies included; we addressed this issue in our review (Martin et al.",1
"In previous work and a scoping study, we found that most of the research carried out in relation to impaired spermatogenesis had investigated time trends rather than association with specific risk factors (Martin et al.",1
"Further, our analysis was limited to prenatal exposure to estrogenic agents.",1
A number of studies have found associations between sperm motility or sperm DNA damage with levels of estrogenic chemicals measured either in urine or serum (Duty et al.,1
It would not be possible however to relate such levels to prenatal exposure.,1
This also illustrates the difficulty of selecting a suitable marker of impaired spermatotogenesis.,1
Our study was implicitly limited to congenital cryptorchidism because the literature search did not yield any case–control or cohort studies that addressed the question of prenatal exposure to estrogenic compounds and acquired cryptorchidism in humans.,1
"We concluded that the significant association between prenatal diethylstilbestrol exposure and all three end points considered conferred weight to the hypothesis of a common etiology for these disorders, and therefore to the existence of a testicular dysgenesis syndrome (Martin et al.",1
"Separate analyses were carried out for the three end points but the methodology applied did not allow us to explore the specific nature of causal relationships between congenital cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and testicular cancer.",1
"As gestational diabetes is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, and has long-term implications for both mother and child, it is important that it is recognized and appropriately managed.",1
"This review will examine the pharmacological options for the management of gestational diabetes, as well as the evidence for blood glucose monitoring, dietary and exercise therapy.",1
"The medical management of gestational diabetes is still evolving, and recent randomized controlled trials have added considerably to our knowledge in this area.",1
"As insulin therapy is effective and safe, it is considered the gold standard of pharmacotherapy for gestational diabetes, against which other treatments have been compared.",1
"The current experience is that the short acting insulin analogs lispro and aspart are safe, but there are only limited data to support the use of long acting insulin analogs.",1
There are randomized controlled trials which have demonstrated efficacy of the oral agents glyburide and metformin.,1
"Whilst short-term data have not demonstrated adverse effects of glyburide and metformin on the fetus, and they are increasingly being used in pregnancy, there remain long-term concerns regarding their potential for harm.",1
"Background\nGestational diabetes (GDM) is defined as “carbohydrate intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy”.1Large studies have found that GDM occurs in 2.2%–8.8% of pregnancies, depending on the ethnic mix of the population and the criteria used for diagnosis.2In some specific populations however, the incidence can be considerably higher.",1
"Essentially, women at risk of type 2 diabetes are at risk of GDM.",1
"The key factor which results in the development of gestational diabetes appears to be a failure to compensate with increased insulin secretion.3As the increase in insulin resistance is greatest in the third trimester, GDM usually develops going into this period.",1
"Therefore, screening for GDM usually occurs around 24–28 weeks into the pregnancy.",1
"The diagnosis is made with an oral glucose tolerance test, though the criteria vary around the world (Table 1).",1
"Risk factors for the development of GDM include obesity, older age, family history, previous history of GDM or poor obstetric outcomes, ethnicity, polycystic ovary syndrome and as more recently noted, hypertension.4,5\nThe major significance of GDM is that it is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.",1
"Macrosomia, shoulder dystocia with its attendant risks of brachial plexus injury and clavicle fracture, and neonatal hypoglycemia are the serious complications which most commonly occur.6–11Jaundice, polycythemia, respiratory distress, and hypocalcemia have also been reported.",1
"Additionally, there are some data that suggest an increase in fetal malformation and perinatal mortality.7,12–15The above risks can be minimized with good glycemic control and judicious obstetric care.",1
"Cesarean sections are also more common, and GDM is associated with a higher risk of pre-eclampsia.9–11\nExposure of the fetus to hyperglycemia may also predispose the child to a diabetes phenotype in later life.",1
"This has been elegantly demonstrated by the long-term follow-up of the offspring of Pima Indian mothers.16,17Offspring who were born to mothers who were already diabetic when pregnant had a 45% likelihood of type 2 diabetes by the age of 20–24, whereas it was 8.6% amongst those with mothers who only developed diabetes after pregnancy (ie, were prediabetic).",1
"Amongst sibships discordant for exposure to hyperglycemia, the sibling exposed to hyperglycemia had a considerably higher risk of subsequent diabetes, suggesting that genetic factors were not predominantly responsible for the difference in diabetes incidence.",1
"Since then, numerous other observational studies have shown that the offspring of diabetic pregnancies have a higher risk of developing a diabetes phenotype.18,19There is also concern that this leads to an intergenerational effect, with GDM promoting diabetes in the offspring, with perpetuation of the vicious cycle when the offspring herself develops GDM, thereby predisposing the grandchild to the development of diabetes as well.20It is unknown however, what degree of hyperglycemia, or indeed if it is related metabolic disturbances, which increases the risk of diabetes to the offspring.",1
Evidence from more contemporary populations is that the likelihood of subsequent diabetes may be substantially higher.22Women who have had GDM account for a significant burden of the population prevalence of diabetes.,1
"It has been estimated that up to one third of women with diabetes, had a GDM pregnancy earlier in their life,2though this was not evident in a recent survey of women with type 2 diabetes.23\nThis review will focus on the medical management of GDM, in particular self monitoring of blood glucose and diabetes education, dietary therapy and physical activity, pharmacotherapy, and post-partum management.",1
"For an excellent discussion of the obstetric management of GDM, I will refer the reader to the review by Conway.24\n\nDiabetes education, self-monitoring of blood glucose, dietary therapy, and exercise\nSelf-care is an important component of the management of GDM.",1
The involvement of a dietician and diabetes educator experienced in the care of women with GDM will facilitate these areas of management.,1
Blood glucose monitoring\nWomen with GDM should perform home blood glucose monitoring.,1
Treatment to post-prandial targets results in superior pregnancy outcomes compared to pre-prandial targets.25The recommended treatment targets vary from country to country (Table 2).,1
These are largely consensus-based as the risk of complications is continuous and there are no obvious thresholds above which the risk markedly increases.,1
Lifestyle measures can provide adequate control in the majority of cases.,1
"If glucose targets are not adequately met by lifestyle measures, and perhaps a review of dietary intake, then pharmacotherapy should be introduced.",1
"Rather than basing the need for insulin on glycemic parameters alone, some have advocated the combined use of ultrasound assessment of fetal abdominal circumference in combination with blood glucose levels.",1
Dietary therapy\nIt is generally accepted that dietary therapy is the cornerstone of treatment of GDM.,1
Therefore all women with GDM should receive counseling from a specialist dietitian.,1
The aim is to achieve normoglycemia whilst providing the required nutrients for normal fetal growth and maternal health.,1
"There are few trials examining the efficacy of dietary therapy for GDM, However, a cluster randomized controlled study has provided support for Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) for GDM, as recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (2004).",1
"In this study, 215 women with GDM were seen at sites randomized to deliver either MNT or standard care.27Fewer subjects in the MNT group required insulin (24.6% vs 31.7%, p = 0.05) and there was a trend to fewer women having a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) >6% (8.1% vs 13.6%, p = 0.25).",1
"The ADA states that all women should receive individualized counseling to provide adequate calories and nutrients to meet the needs of pregnancy and consistent with the blood glucose goals (fasting ≤105 mg/dl [5.8 mmol/L], 1 hr ≤155 mg/dl [8.6 mmol/L], and 2 hrs ≤130 mg/dl [7.2 mmol/L]).",1
"For obese women, a 30%–33% calorie restriction to approximately 25 kcal/kg actual weight per day is recommended.",1
Carbohydrate should be restricted to 35%–40% of calories.,1
"There are also data to support low carbohydrate diets in pregnancy, and for the carbohydrate to be of low glycemic index.",1
"In a nonrandomized study, women with GDM on a diet comprising less than 42% carbohydrate, had lower post-prandial glucose levels, were less likely to require insulin, and had a lower incidence of large for gestational age.28A small study which randomized pregnant women to low glycemic index (GI) or high GI diets found that the former resulted in lower glucose levels, a blunting of the pregnancy associated rise in insulin resistance, and lower birthweight.29In another study of GI, women assigned to a low GI diet during pregnancy gave birth to infants who were lighter (3408 ± 78 g vs 3644 ± 90 g) and had a lower incidence of large for gestational age, compared to women given a high GI diet.30Both diets comprised 55% carbohydrate.",1
"Whilst the latter studies were not specifically performed in women with GDM, they suggest that the concept of GI is valid in pregnancy, and it would be appropriate to recommend low GI carbohydrate to women with GDM.",1
Additional dietary measures are usually based upon the general recommendations for diabetes mellitus.,1
A reduction in simple carbohydrates and fat intake is advisable.,1
"Emphasis is given to spreading the dietary intake over six meals daily, with three main meals and three snacks, in order to avoid large carbohydrate loads at any time.",1
"Except for saccharin, which can cross the placenta and is therefore not recommended, other noncaloric sweeteners may be used in moderation.",1
"Physical activity\nIn people with type 2 diabetes, there is ample evidence that regular physical activity enhances insulin sensitivity, facilitates weight loss, and thereby improves glucose control.",1
"Several small studies have examined whether regular exercise is also beneficial in the management of GDM Jovanavic-Petersen randomized 19 women with GDM to a regime of diet alone, or diet with 20 minutes of supervised aerobic training three days per week for six weeks.31This modest amount of physical activity resulted in lower fasting glucose levels, lower glucose responses to a glucose challenge, and a lower HbA1c.",1
"Another study randomized 29 women with GDM to 30 minutes of exercise at 70% estimated maximal heart rate, 3–4 times per week, or control.32There was a trend to improved glucose levels in those who exercised, which did not reach significance.",1
"Measures of cardiorespiratory fitness however, improved.",1
"A study of 32 women randomized to circuit type exercise three times a week or control, found that resistance training resulted in lower postprandial glucose levels, and a delay in the requirement of insulin.33Amongst women with a prepregnancy BMI > 25, those who were in the exercise arm were less likely to require insulin.",1
"Therefore, it seems reasonable to recommend that when there is no medical or obstetric contraindication, women with GDM should maintain a sensible level of light and moderate intensity physical activity until the latter stages of the pregnancy.",1
"The above studies provide reassurance that moderate intensity activities such as walking for 20–30 minutes each day, and attendance at antenatal exercise classes can be safely encouraged, and that modest improvements in glycemic control might be achieved.",1
"Insulin therapy for gestational diabetes\nWhen treatment targets are not achieved by dietary means, then insulin is required.",1
"In some cases, an additional morning injection of basal insulin may further improve glycemic control.",1
"As the level of insulin resistance varies from person to person, it is common practice to commence the woman on small doses of insulin, and then to increase the doses at frequent intervals until target glucose levels are attained.",1
The required dosage of insulin usually increases gradually over the third trimester of pregnancy.,1
This may be an early indicator of placental insufficiency.,1
Frequent review and titration of the insulin dosage is recommended.,1
"Unlike the situation for women with pre-existing type 1 diabetes however, significant hypoglycemia is uncommon in women with insulin-treated GDM.",1
Nonetheless the woman should be advised regarding appropriate hypoglycemia prevention and management measures.,1
"For many years, fast-acting (regular) insulin, and intermediate-acting (isophane) insulin have been the preferred insulins for the treatment of GDM.",1
"Human insulin does not normally cross the placenta, though antibody bound animal insulin has been reported to do so.35However, it has been shown by36Jovanovic that it is maternal glucose control, rather than maternal anti-insulin antibody levels which influence birthweight.36Human insulin is considered safe in pregnancy as years of experience has not suggested an increase in fetal complications as a consequence of its use.",1
"There is now increasing evidence that the newer rapid acting insulin analogs lispro and aspart are also safe in pregnancy, and indeed, they are commonly used.",1
"Although there was an initial small uncontrolled report which suggested that Lispro may have teratogenic effects when used in type 1 diabetic pregnancy,37this has not been borne out in subsequent studies.",1
"No increase in pregnancy complications have been found in observational studies where lispro was used, in either women with GDM38,43or pre-existing diabetes.38–43There are few reports regarding the use of aspart in pregnancy.",1
"However, a large randomized controlled trial comparing aspart with regular human insulin in 322 pregnant women with type 1 diabetes has been performed.44Comparable birth outcomes were found between the two arms, suggesting that aspart is as safe and effective as human insulin.",1
"They have all demonstrated that the rapid acting analogues are as effective as regular insulin in the treatment of GDM, with comparable, if not favorable, outcomes (Table 3).",1
"In one study, aspart was detected in the cord blood for one subject.45However, as it was not detected in other subjects, the authors postulated that this was due to the disruption of the uterine-placental barrier during delivery, when the mother had been receiving an aspart infusion.",1
As yet there have been no reports of the use of glulisine in pregnancy.,1
Data regarding the long-acting insulin analogs are less clear than for rapid-acting analogs.,1
There are a number of case reports and small case series of glargine being utilized without the development of pregnancy complications.,1
The majority of these have been in patients with type 1 diabetes.,1
"There are also data from a total of 48 women with GDM.46,47To date no randomized controlled studies have been published.",1
"Concerns have been expressed about the use of glargine in pregnancy, because of its potential effect on mitogenesis, mediated by its high affinity to the IGF-1 receptor, which is six times that of natural insulin48,49Whilst insulin detemir has a lower binding affinity to the IGF-1 receptor than natural insulin, there is even less information regarding its use in pregnancy.",1
"Although their safety has not been proven, it is often rationalized that a change in the basal insulin will result in deterioration in glycemic control, and therefore the risk of continuing glargine is less than the risk from changing insulins.",1
"However, until their safety in pregnancy can be clearly established, the initiation of long-acting insulin analog therapy in women with GDM cannot be recommended.",1
Oral antidiabetic agents in gestational diabetes\nThere is controversy regarding the use of oral hypoglycemic agents during pregnancy.,1
"Most government drug agencies have not approved their use in pregnancy, and major specialty diabetes organizations recommend that oral agents be ceased if the woman had been taking them pre-pregnancy53–55There have now however, been randomized trials conducted with both glyburide and metformin which have not demonstrated short term harm to the pregnancy.",1
"Glyburide (Glibenclamide)\nAmerican authors have stated that glyburide has replaced insulin as first line pharmacological treatment of GDM in many practices.56This has largely occurred on the basis of a randomized controlled trial where 404 women with GDM were treated with glyburide (up to 20 mg/day) or insulin57In this study, the level of glycemic control achieved was the same in both groups (mean glucose concentration during treatment with glyburide 5.9 ± 0.9 mmol/L compared to 5.9 ± 1.0 mmol/L in insulin group).",1
Only 4% of women treated with glyburide achieved inadequate control and required a switch to insulin.,1
"Additionally, a number of nonrandomized or retrospective studies examining the treatment of GDM with glyburide have been reported (Table 4).",1
"In general, these indicate that glyburide is effective in achieving glycemic control in the majority of patients.",1
"Most, but not all, suggest that glyburide is as safe as insulin for the fetus.",1
"A meta-analysis which included the above studies as well as others examining women with pre-existing diabetes, with 745 glyburide exposed pregnancies and 637 treated with insulin, has been performed.65This study found that glyburide did not increase the risk of macrosomia, large for gestational age, or neonatal hypoglycemia, but did not examine more serious consequences such as perinatal mortality or congenital anomalies.",1
Several studies have examined factors which predict failure of glyburide to achieve adequate glycemic control.,1
"Higher glucose levels, either in the glucose tolerance test upon which GDM was diagnosed, or on self-monitoring, and early dietary failure have been found to be associated with glyburide failure.60,58These findings lead to the logical conclusion that subjects with more severe GDM are more likely to require insulin.",1
"Further evidence supporting the safety of glyburide for the fetus comes from a study using an in vitro perfusion, where it was not found to cross the placenta in significant amounts.66However, another in vitro study has found transplacental transfer of glyburide.67In the Langer randomized controlled trial, glyburide was not detected in the cord blood of the neonates and cord insulin levels were similar between the two groups.57\n\nMetformin\nA number of studies have provided conflicting information regarding the safety of metformin use in type 2 diabetic pregnancy.68–70There are studies which have used metformin during pregnancy in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, without any noticeable adverse effects on the fetus.71There are few publications of its use in GDM, and these are dominated by the Metformin in Gestational Diabetes (MiG) Study.",1
"Interestingly fetal death and malformations were not a component of the primary outcome; however, 19 events in the metformin group were classified as serious fetal or neonatal adverse events (including 11 congenital anomalies) compared to 23 events in the insulin arm (including 18 congenital anomalies and one fetal death).",1
None of these events were adjudged by the data and safety monitoring committee to be treatment related and there were no serious adverse events associated with the use of metformin.,1
"Additionally, more women using metformin indicated that their treatment was acceptable compared to those on insulin.",1
"From these results, the authors have suggested that metformin is a safe and effective treatment for GDM.",1
Several small studies comparing metformin to insulin for the treatment of GDM have also been performed (Table 5).,1
"Two have concluded that metformin is as effective as insulin for glycemic control in GDM, and that it is safe.",1
"However, one study, a randomised controlled trial, was underpowered to realistically address the effectiveness and safety of metformin in GDM.73In another study, a retrospective case control study, subjects treated with insulin had a greater degree of initial glucose intolerance, so the comparison was of limited validity.74A third study comprised a retrospective cohort which included a mixture of both GDM and women with Type 2 diabetes seen from 1966–1991.",1
"It found an increase in stillbirth and perinatal mortality, as well as pre-eclampsia amongst those treated with metformin, compared to women treated with insulin or sulphonylureas.",1
"However, as there was no evaluation of glycemic control early in pregnancy, and more women on metformin had pre-existing type 2 diabetes, the groups do not appear to be well matched.",1
It is quite possible that the adverse findings in this study are due to more women in the metformin group having a greater severity of hyperglycemia early in the pregnancy.,1
"Long-term concerns regarding glyburide and metformin therapy for GDM\nAlthough the above randomized trials have demonstrated non-inferiority of glyburide and metformin in achieving glycemic control, and satisfactory birth outcomes compared to insulin therapy, concerns must remain as long-term issues have not yet been addressed.",1
"Repeated episodes of GDM are associated with the earlier development of diabetes, and this has been postulated to be due to the increased stress that the β-cells are exposed to with each pregnancy.75By treating the mother with glyburide, it is possible that this accentuates β-cell stress and accelerates their decline, whereas insulin therapy would conversely provide a degree of relief to the β-cells.",1
"Therefore glyburide has the potential to result in earlier development of maternal diabetes, and long-term follow-up of the mothers are needed to alleviate this concern.",1
"In contradistinction, metformin reduces insulin resistance and hepatic gluconeogenesis, which theoretically would be beneficial for the preservation of β-cell function.",1
"In subjects with type 2 diabetes, the ADOPT Study has demonstrated that metformin is superior to glyburide in this regard.76As there is transplacental passage of metformin,77,78its effect on fetal insulin resistance might even provide further benefit in light of data of insulin resistance and insulin secretory defects in offspring of diabetic pregnancies.19However, any pharmacological agent which crosses the placenta must be viewed with caution as there always remains the possibility of unexpected long-term effects.",1
Metformin alters gene expression in mice livers and has been demonstrated to have an antiproliferative effect through reductions in cyclin D1 and activation of AMP kinase.79The programming and developmental effects of these on a fetus are unknown.,1
"Furthermore, metformin can promote the development of lactic acidosis, which surely must be a concern in situations of fetal distress.",1
"Whilst 18-month follow-up data on 126 offspring of women with polycystic ovary syndrome treated with metformin during pregnancy have not revealed any deficiencies in growth or motor-social development, this may be too short a time frame for potential programming effects of metformin to become evident.80\nIn view of the above concerns regarding the potential of glyburide and metformin to have long-term effects on the mother and child, I would recommend caution with their use in the treatment of GDM.",1
A subgroup of infants from the MIG Study are currently being followed up.72It may be circumspect to await the findings from this follow-up study before metformin can be considered safe for the routine treatment of GDM.,1
"Other oral antidiabetic agents for gestational diabetes\nThere is one study which randomized women with GDM to treatment with insulin, glyburide, or acarbose.61Forty two percent of the acarbose subjects failed to achieve adequate glycemic control and ultimately required insulin therapy.",1
"Whilst this study is inadequately powered to demonstrate safety of acarbose, it is not absorbed from the gut, and therefore would be unlikely to affect the fetus.",1
However it is of low potency and insulin therapy will often need to be introduced.,1
"Furthermore, the high frequency of gastrointestinal side effects experienced by people with type 2 diabetes suggests that any future role of acarbose, even if subsequent studies confirm safety, will be limited.",1
There are no studies using glitazones in pregnancy.,1
"Transplacental transfer occurs,67,81and until studies demonstrating safety are performed, they should be avoided in pregnancy.",1
"Evidence that treatment of gestational diabetes improves pregnancy outcomes\nThe strongest evidence that treatment of GDM is of benefit comes from the Australian Carbohydrate Intolerance Study (ACHOIS) in Pregnant Women.82In this randomized controlled trial, 1000 women fulfilling the 1985 WHO criteria for “gestational glucose intolerance” were recruited.",1
One other important finding of this study was that intensively treated women had better quality of life and lower rates of depression.,1
"Prior to ACHOIS, a large number of other studies had been performed to ascertain if treatment of GDM is of benefit.",1
"These studies were largely retrospective, unrandomized, or lacked power to detect differences in serious adverse perinatal outcomes and will not be listed here.",1
"However, one large retrospective cohort study of 116,303 pregnancies, merits discussion.",1
"It therefore seems likely that the decreased mortality rate was at least in part a consequence of treatment of GDM, rather than only to other improvements in obstetric outcome.",1
Post-partum management of gestational diabetes\nThe medical management of gestational diabetes should not conclude with the delivery of the fetus.,1
"Although hyperglycemia usually resolves with the conclusion of the pregnancy, women who have had GDM are at high risk of developing diabetes later in life.",1
"Apart from the development of diabetes, women who have had GDM have an adverse cardiac risk profile, including the metabolic syndrome.83,84A higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease that occurs at a younger age, independent of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes has also been demonstrated.83\nIn view of the above, it is important that the woman who has had GDM receive counseling and support to reduce her long-term risk of diabetes.",1
"Screening for diabetes, at regular intervals, is recommended by a number of diabetes societies.4,85This is important for the early diagnosis of diabetes, to facilitate the prevention of complications.",1
"Furthermore, if the woman is of reproductive age, the pre-pregnancy recognition of diabetes is vital so that early pregnancy conditions can be optimized to prevent diabetes fetopathy.",1
"Issues specific to pre-existing diabetes in pregnancy include tight glycemic control and adequate folate supplementation.53,54Additionally, post partum evaluation and management of reversible cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia should be undertaken.",1
"There is evidence that lifestyle modification, aiming for a 5%–7% reduction in body weight, is effective in preventing or delaying the development of diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance.",1
"Both the Diabetes Prevention Program86and the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study87demonstrated this, with an intensive intervention including lifestyle coaches, strict supervised exercise regimes and caloric restriction.",1
"As 15% of the women in the Diabetes Prevention Program and Diabetes Prevention Study had GDM, similar measures should be recommended to women after they have had GDM.",1
"However, it is unclear if less intensive interventions can be effective in this population.",1
"To date, small short-term studies focusing on dietary counseling alone, or a combination of behavioral strategies with weekly exercise classes, have not demonstrated an improvement in glucose tolerance.88,89In part, this is probably due to the real life challenges of maintaining motivation for healthy lifestyle change amongst young women at a time that they are having to deal with young children, return to work, and further education.",1
"Nonetheless, there are undisputed benefits to healthy eating and regular physical activity so these activities should be encouraged.",1
"Summary and conclusions\nGestational diabetes is a common disorder which in the majority of cases, should initially be managed by dietary measures.",1
Moderate physical activity should be encouraged.,1
Fasting and post-prandial glucose testing is necessary for monitoring and guidance of therapy.,1
"Where dietary measures are inadequate to achieve glycemic targets, insulin should be introduced.",1
"Insulin is still the mainstay of pharmacological treatment of GDM, and this is ideally administered in a basal bolus regimen.",1
"The rapid acting analogs lispro and aspart are considered safe, but the safety of the long-acting analogs are yet to be determined.",1
"Whilst there are studies demonstrating short-term safety of glyburide and metformin during pregnancy, I suggest that they be reserved for situations where implementation of insulin therapy is impractical or not possible.",1
"After all, we know that insulin therapy is safe and usually effective.",1
ACHOIS has shown that it is acceptable to the majority of women.,1
"By eschewing insulin, doctors may actually be treating their own perceived fear of injections, rather than providing the best therapy to the patient.",1
"Based on our current information, insulin is still the best option, with the least potential for long-term risk to the mother and child.",1
"With good medical and obstetric care, the risks to the pregnancy should be minimal.",1
"However, a woman with GDM is a woman at high risk of future diabetes.",1
"Therefore after the pregnancy, healthy lifestyle measures should be encouraged to minimize the likelihood of developing diabetes, and regular screening for diabetes should be undertaken.",1
"Early life nutrition, the developing immune system and subsequent allergic manifestations\nOver the last half-century, chronic disease incidence, including allergic manifestations (AM), has increased exponentially in developed nations and amongst the wealthy in developing nations.",1
"While diet can impact health at any life stage, it is likely to be most important during the fetal and infancy periods, when the immune system is immature.",1
"Based on an extensive review of the literature, we considered this hypothesis for the 3 nutritional progressions from fetal life through infancy: prenatal nutrition, breastfeeding and introduction of solid foods.",1
"While there is little conclusive evidence to support that a prudent diet is protective against AM especially after birth, modest evidence suggests that a prenatal maternal nutrition high in n-3 and micronutrients (e.g.",1
This indicates that there may be a window of opportunity during fetal development in which allergic manifestation risk may be altered.,1
The effect of breastfeeding on the prevention AM is unresolved.,1
"Despite this, exclusive breastfeeding to 4-6 months should be encouraged as human milk contains numerous immunological properties and is associated with other health benefits.",1
"If breastfeeding is not possible, hydrolyzed formulas seem to confer a greater protective effect than traditional formulas.",1
Solid foods should be introduced at age 4-6 months.,1
The order of introduction seems to have little effect on AM.,1
"At present, it is impossible to conclusively state that a particular dietary pattern or food will alter AM risk in infants.",1
"Dietary intake of fish, omega-3, omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin D and the prevalence of psychotic-like symptoms in a cohort of 33 000 women from the general population\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nLow intake of fish, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and vitamin D deficiency has been suggested to play a role in the development of schizophrenia.",1
"Our aim was to evaluate the association between the intake of different fish species, PUFA and vitamin D and the prevalence of psychotic-like symptoms in a population-based study among Swedish women.",1
The effect was most pronounced for omega-6 PUFAs.,1
The associations were J-shaped with the strongest reduced risk for an intermediate intake of fish or PUFA.,1
"For fatty fish (herring/mackerel, salmon-type fish), the strongest inverse association was found for an intermediate intake (RR: 0.81, 95% CI, 0.66-0.98), whereas a high intake of fatty fish was associated with an increased risk of psychotic-like symptoms (RR: 1.90, 95% CI, 1.34-2.70).",1
"Conclusion\nOur findings raise a possibility that adult women with a high intake of fish, omega-3 or omega-6 PUFA and vitamin D have a lower rate of psychotic-like symptoms.",1
"Background\nEven though psychoses are relatively rare, between 5-15% of the general population has been estimated to report single schizophrenia-like symptoms like delusions, magical thinking, and hearing internal voices at some point in their lifetime [1-3].",1
The biological mechanisms underlying the etiology of schizophrenia and psychotic symptoms are largely unknown.,1
"Genetic constitution is important [4], but environmental factors like an unhealthy lifestyle with a poor diet may be involved [5,6].",1
Schizophrenia in adulthood is often preceded by milder symptoms and delusions during adolescence.,1
Meta-analysis [8] and prospective follow-up studies indicates that up to 75-90% of developmental psychotic experiences are transitory.,1
Persistence and clinical relevant impairment may be related to a family history of schizophrenia and environmental risk factors that might interact with the genetic risk.,1
Self-reported psychotic experiences in the general population may represent the developmental expression of population genetic risk for psychosis [9].,1
"Low maternal fish and seafood consumption during pregnancy is reported to increase the risk for a low IQ and suboptimal neuro-developmental outcomes in childhood [10], factors that in turn are associated with an increased risk for adult mental disorders like schizophrenia [11].",1
A recent meta-analysis found a latitude related increase in schizophrenia prevalence that was greater for groups with low fish consumption [12].,1
"Fatty fish is a rich dietary source of essential fatty acids and vitamin D, both of which could be implicated in the development of schizophrenia.",1
"For instance, it has been proposed that aberration in metabolism of phospholipids could be a biochemical basis for psychiatric disorders [13].",1
"Although, only hypothesis generating, two ecological studies support the hypothesis by reporting the ratio of saturated fat to PUFA in the diet is a strong predictor of schizophrenia outcome, measured as according to either clinical or to social variables [6,14].",1
"Also, the dietary intake of PUFA was negatively correlated with the severity of psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia [15].",1
"Lower levels of PUFA have been found in brain content, red blood cells and skin fibroblast among patients with schizophrenia, compared with a healthy population [13,16].",1
"Results from a review of several randomized clinical trials of PUFA treatment of schizophrenia were inconclusive, although, it seems that supplementation of especially EPA to these patients may have a positive effect on their schizophrenic symptoms [17].",1
"Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that prenatal vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for schizophrenia, supported by the role of this vitamin in cell growth and differentiation, the excess of winter births in schizophrenia (a period when vitamin D levels are low), and increased births of pre-schizophrenic subjects in urban areas, where vitamin D deficiency is higher [12,18].",1
"However, to our knowledge, no study has investigated the association between dietary intake of fish, omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA or vitamin D and the risk of having positive psychotic symptoms in the general adult population.",1
"The main purpose of the present study was to evaluate the association between the dietary intake of different fish species, the dietary intake of PUFAs (omega-3 and omega-6) and vitamin D and the prevalence of positive psychotic-like symptoms in a population-based study among Swedish women.",1
"The CAPE tool has proven to be a stable, valid and reliable self-report instrument for the measurement of psychotic-like experiences in the general population based on cross-validation with interview-based data [24,25].",1
"We are aware that some arachidonic acid (AA) could be found in fish [27], however, we choose to include those fatty acids that are dominating in fatty fish into the variable ""marine fatty acids"".",1
"However, we were not able take environmental factors and geographic area into account, because the study questionnaire did not assess the origin of fish, such as the Baltic Sea or the Atlantic Ocean.",1
"The category ""low level symptoms group"" (no psychotic-like symptoms) was used as the reference group.",1
"Since, the outcome status (namely psychotic symptoms) among participants was unknown at study entry we cannot draw any conclusions about causality, only about the existence of associations (negative or positive).",1
"Based on the hypothesis under study we interpreted the RR<1 as a negative association (for simplicity we refer to it from now on ""decreased risk"") and RR>1 as a positive association (for simplicity we refer to it from now on as ""increased risk"").",1
The selection of covariates included in the final multivariate models was based on proportional (≥10%) change in β-coefficients and previous subject matter knowledge.,1
"We initially tested all covariates, and those included in the final models were considered to be important confounding factors for the relation between the main exposure and psychotic-like symptoms.",1
We decided not to include dietary Vitamin D estimates in the final multivariate models as fish is a rich source of vitamin D and could account for some of the effect of fish on our outcome.,1
"Additionally, there is a high correlation between vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids (correlation = 0.77).",1
"Women in the high level group were more likely to be never drinkers than women in the low level group, the multivariate RR, adjusted for smoking, BMI, education and country of birth, was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-1.8).",1
The remaining dietary intake of different food items and specific nutrients were similar among the three groups of women with different levels of positive psychotic-like symptoms (Table1).,1
"However, there was a J-shaped association between psychotic-like symptoms and fatty fish (herring/mackerel and salmon-type fish) with the strongest inverse association for intermediate dietary intake (RR: 0.81, 95% CI, 0.66-0.98), whereas a high intake (RR: 1.90, 95% CI, 1.34-2.70) of fatty fish was associated with an increased risk of high level psychotic-like symptoms.",1
"In the high level symptoms group compared with the low level symptoms group, the intake of shellfish 1-3 times per month was associated with a reduced risk, whereas the intake of shellfish more than three times per week was associated with an increased risk.",1
The latter result did not remain significant after multivariate adjustment (Table2).,1

"We found support for a protective effect regarding the risk of positive psychotic-like symptoms with high dietary intake of fish, omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA, as well as of vitamin D. The associations were J-shaped with the strongest reduced risk for an intermediate intake of fish or PUFA.",1
Our findings provide further support for the hypothesis that an aberration in lipid metabolism may be involved in the biochemical basis for psychiatric disorders [13].,1
"This suggestion has earlier been supported by ecological studies showing that variations in schizophrenia outcome between countries may be due to differences in the diet [6,14].",1
Further evidence for the hypothesis that PUFA is involved in the etiology of psychiatric disease has been put forward through the study by Stokes et al.,1
"showing a negative correlation between dietary PUFA intake and the severity of psychotic symptoms [15], as well as studies showing that patients with schizophrenia or depression have lower levels of PUFAs in brain tissue, red blood cells and skin fibroblasts and with a low intake of fish and PUFAs [16,29-31].",1
"Finally, supplementation of PUFA, especially EPA, has been reported to be of possible benefit for patients with schizophrenia [17].",1
No earlier studies that we are aware of have evaluated the relationship between adult vitamin D levels and psychotic symptoms.,1
Our findings indicated a protective effect of vitamin D for the risk of psychotic-like symptoms.,1
Prenatal vitamin D deficiency has been proposed to be a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia [12].,1
"Results from the Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort showed that vitamin D supplementation during the first year of life was associated with a reduced risk of schizophrenia in males, but not in women [32].",1
"However, a small pilot study of maternal vitamin D levels in archived prenatal sera, showed no decrease in prenatal vitamin D in subjects who later developed schizophrenia [33].",1
It has been hypothesised that vitamin D insufficiency could account for some of the increased risk of schizophrenia observed among dark-skinned immigrants moving to countries with less sun exposure [12].,1
"Our results of a protective effect of vitamin D intake must be considered as rough, since we only measure the dietary intake of vitamin D. A more complete picture of the vitamin D status could have been supplied through vitamin D levels in blood; however, no biological samples are available.",1
"The absorption of dietary vitamin D is generally high at all stages of life [34], but serum levels also depend on the endogenous production of vitamin D due to sun exposure which is subject to seasonal variations.",1
"Thus, the correlation between vitamin D intake and serum levels may vary.",1
"However, Burgaz et al.",1
recently reported that 2-3 weekly servings of fatty fish increased 25(OH)D by 45% in a population of Swedish women [35].,1
"Our results of the protective effect of fatty fish could in part be due to the content of vitamin D. While the epidemiological evidence linking low prenatal vitamin D and schizophrenia remains inconclusive, rodent models have provided compelling evidence about the role of vitamin D deficiency for brain development like larger lateral volumes [36], subtle memory dysfunction and altered attention processing [37] which have implications for neuropsychiatric disorders.",1
"Unexpectedly, the intake of fatty fish (salmon, herring and mackerel) or shellfish more than twice a week increased the risk of being in the group with the highest level of psychotic-like symptoms.",1
This puzzling finding may be due to unknown or known unhealthy constituents of fatty fish.,1
"For instance, environmental pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and dioxins are known to accumulate in fatty fish [38].",1
Another possible explanation may be that the frequent intake of fish and PUFA may be advantageous in lower doses but disadvantageous in higher doses.,1
and Peet & Horrobin suggest that there might be such a therapeutic window for DHA and EPA regarding their protective role for schizophrenia or depression [39-41].,1
Significant higher levels of DHA have been found in red cell membranes of un-medicated schizophrenic patients compared to healthy control subjects [42].,1
"Furthermore, our findings of a more pronounced protective effect of omega-6 fatty acids than for omega-3 fatty acid are in agreement with the results from an EPA supplementation study in schizophrenia presented by Horrobins et al.",1
"This study surprisingly found that the effect of intermediate doses of EPA increased the levels of AA (an omega-6 PUFA) in the membrane of red cells, whereas higher doses of EPA did not, and the EPA-induced rise in AA was associated with a clinical improvement.",1
The respective biological effects of omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids on the etiology of psychiatric symptoms could very well differ and the balance between the intakes of these fatty acids might be of importance.,1
"It has been proposed that the ratio of omega-3:omega-6 fatty acids might be more important in inhibiting the development of several diseases, including cancer, inflammatory and heart diseases [45,46].",1
"We find no support for this in our results, since, the effect of omega-3:omega-6 fatty acids on psychotic-like symptoms were almost similar to those of omega-3 fatty acids.",1
"However, the mechanisms of action and protective abilities of PUFA could differ between different diseases.",1
The non-linearity in the association might seemingly argue against a possible causal relationship.,1
"However, the associations with dietary components and health are often non-linear with advantageous effects of a balanced nutrition [47-50].",1
We have no baseline measure of symptom levels to further elucidate causality between different levels of intake of fatty fish or shellfish and the risk of positive psychotic-like symptoms.,1
"However, keeping the prevalence figures for psychotic disorders in mind, rather few participants in our population sample are likely to have a disorder, which may diminish the problem of reversed causality related to psychotic diagnosis or medication.",1
"In our study, the definition of psychotic-like symptoms was based on self-reported frequency of psychosis-like experiences.",1
"The classification of women into three groups with different levels of symptoms (low, middle and high) was based on predefined, but arbitrary cut-offs from the self-reported answers to the CAPE questionnaire.",1
We acknowledge the limitation that the scale have not been used earlier in Sweden and validated in the Swedish population.,1
These characteristics are often seen in patients with psychotic disorders [51-53].,1
"Based on the sum population prevalence of schizophrenia and other psychoses in middle-aged women [54], we might expect that 2-3% of the study participants would cross the boundaries to clinically valid syndromes.",1
"The CAPE measures of psychosis are strongly correlated with measures of general psychopathology, including depression.",1
"The association between the positive and the depressive dimension in CAPE, which we unfortunately could not include for practical reasons, is fairly low when distress associated with positive symptoms is held constant (r = 0.25; Stefanis et al., 2002 [1]).",1
"Thus, there are reasons to believe that the dimension of positive symptoms is an independent dimension.",1
In terms of generalisability of our results it is relevant to compare the levels of dietary intake of PUFAs and vitamin D in our cohort to other populations.,1
The contribution of dietary intakes of PUFAs to total dietary fat is comparable to other Western cohorts [55].,1
"The quotient omega-6 PUFA/omega-3 PUFA was 4:1 in this study, and this value is comparable to other European cohorts [56,57], but lower than that has been reported for US populations (Food and Nutrition Board.",1
The dietary intake of vitamin D in this cohort is comparable to several other European populations [58].,1
It is relevant to note that in Sweden low-fat dairy products and margarines are fortified with vitamin D. Otherwise the dietary intake of vitamin D would be lower.,1
"Furthermore, men were not included in the study and there is gender difference in the prevalence of psychosis [59].",1
However psychotic-like experiences in the general population might be more equally distributed among women and men [60].,1
The strengths of our study include its thorough diet data design and large sample size.,1
"The ethnic homogeneity of our study population reduces the risk of confounding by unmeasured factors, both genetic and environmental.",1
"We were able to adjust for smoking, BMI, migration, education and alcohol that could confound our associations between diet and psychotic-like symptoms.",1
"We had no information about socioeconomic status, but the adjustment for education, which is strongly associated with socioeconomic status, did not change the estimates.",1
"Still, we cannot rule out that there are unknown confounders that we have not been adjusted for, for example drugs influencing levels of serum lipids or family history of psychiatric illness.",1
"If the proportion of non-urbanized participants was high in the study population this could have confounded our results, nevertheless this is not the case in the Swedish population.",1
"Misclassification of fish and PUFA or vitamin D intake due to measurement error associated with the food frequency questionnaire is unavoidable, but given the study design likely non-differential, and thus attenuating any true association.",1
It is also relevant to note that Hibbeln et al.,1
"reported high correlations (r = 0.7) between the dietary intake of EPA and DHA and serum levels of EPA and DHA in subjects with schizophrenia [51], indicating a good ability to report dietary intake accurately.",1
"An important limitation of this study is that we measured dietary intake only once, involving misclassification among those who changed their dietary pattern during follow-up.",1
"However, again some misclassification of dietary intake cannot be ruled out, such a misclassification is likely to be non-differential, and attenuating any true association.",1
"Unfortunately, we do not have information about specific vitamin D supplementation.",1
"But, adjustment for multivitamin supplement intake, containing vitamin D, did not change the estimates.",1
"Unfortunately, we do not have any information about the use of such supplements during follow-up.",1
"However, according to national figures from the National Food Administration, a low number of Swedish women took fish oil supplements (1%) at the time of the study.",1
"The drop-outs had a slightly higher BMI, lower education and were more often smokers and born outside of the Nordic countries.",1
"However, our main exposure (fish/fatty acids) did not differ between those who participated and those who did not participate in the study.",1
"Conclusions\nIn conclusion, in this large-scale cohort of Swedish women we found that a frequent consumption of fish, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids appears to reduce the risk of positive psychotic-like symptoms.",1
"The associations for fatty fish or shellfish were J-shaped, with the strongest inverse association for an intermediate dietary intake, whereas a high intake was associated with a higher rate of high level psychotic-like symptoms.",1
"Interestingly, we found a lower rate of psychotic-like symptoms with increasing vitamin D intake.",1
Future studies are warranted for replication and should evaluate if this is a causal relationship.,1
There are no current studies that can give real good answers to the question if dietary deficiency interacts with genetic vulnerability for schizophrenia.,1
Schizophrenia is a multifactorial disorder with strong genetic vulnerability and the vulnerability might include metabolic aberrations.,1
"Further, it would be of interest to study if dietary aspects are associated with separable latent dimensions of positive psychotic-like symptoms and if the associations are valid for men and for other age groups.",1
"Season of Birth and Risk for Adult Onset Glioma\n\nAbstract\nAdult onset glioma is a rare cancer which occurs more frequently in Caucasians than African Americans, and in men than women.",1
The etiology of this disease is largely unknown.,1
"Exposure to ionizing radiation is the only well established environmental risk factor, and this factor explains only a small percentage of cases.",1
Several recent studies have reported an association between season of birth and glioma risk.,1
"This paper reviews the plausibility of evidence focusing on the seasonal interrelation of farming, allergies, viruses, vitamin D, diet, birth weight, and handedness.",1
"To date, a convincing explanation for the occurrence of adult gliomas decades after a seasonal exposure at birth remains elusive.",1
"Despite considerable efforts to unravel the etiologic basis for this cancer and attempts to find a cure, gliomas largely remain refractory to treatment.",1
"However, the attributable risk for these factors is small and can only explain a fraction of cases.",1
Evidence of an association between adult-onset glioma and date of birth suggests an etiologic role for a seasonally variable environmental exposure occurring prenatally around the time of birth.,1
"Similarly, exposure to asbestos 70 years prior to the development of mesothelioma [4], suggests a “one insult, co-carcinogenic model” of cancer development [5].",1
"Risk factors that may exhibit seasonal epidemicity include exposure to infectious agents, allergens, pesticides, indoor environmental tobacco smoke, and other sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., soot from fires for home heating), and use of antihistamines.",1
"Other putative candidates include harmonic variation in population mixing, diet, temperature, humidity, sunlight/photoperiod, levels of vitamin D3, and endogenous hormones [6,7].",1
The origins of many childhood and adult malignancies are believed to be determined during a finite perinatal window.,1
"During this period the brain and immune systems are less developed, undergoing greater cell growth and differentiation, and possibly more susceptible to DNA and epigenetic changes underlying cancer development in the near or distant future [5,8–13].",1
"In this model, environmental exposures and lifestyle changes that occur afterwards play a mainly secondary role to the programming or imprinting that occurs during pregnancy and/or early infancy [14,15].",1
"Review of Literature\nSeveral recent studies have explored season of birth as a risk factor for adult glioma, but results have been mixed (Table 1).",1
"Three independent reports have observed a peak risk for winter births [16–18], while no seasonal variation for risk was noted in two other epidemiologic studies [19,20].",1
"A multi-centered study of four Midwest states examining rural and farm exposures observed a statistically significant increased risk of adult gliomas for springtime births, but only among those born “off” a farm [21].",1
"Similarly, the study of childhood brain tumors and season of birth have yielded equivocal results [22–26].",1
Risk Factors Related To Season of Birth\nThe underlying rationale for the occurrence of a glioma decades after a seasonal exposure remains elusive.,1
No specific etiologic agent to date has been identified to support such a long induction period for this cancer.,1
"Several hypothetical arguments have been offered in explanation of a season of birth effect for adult gliomas, if such an association exists.",1
"Thus far, the major evidence in support of a seasonal effect involves farming, allergies/immunity, viruses, and vitamin D. Other possible factors related to seasonal birth are diet, birth weight, and handedness.",1
"Many farm chemicals are classified as probable or likely human carcinogens by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), most notably acephate, dichlorvos, dimethoate, lindane, parathion, phosmet, and tetrachlorvinphos [28].",1
"Household dust concentrations of azinphosmethyl, chlorpyrifos, parathion, and phosmet have been found to be significantly higher in farmer or farmworker homes than in referent homes [29].",1
"Homes with high pet activities have been shown to have greater levels of pesticide residues in sampled carpet dust than homes with low pet activities [31,32].",1
"In tandem with living on a farm, infants have unique vulnerabilities that may lead to higher levels of exposures in the same environment than adults [9].",1
"Dryness, rashes, and related skin conditions, to which infants may be particularly susceptible, serve to disrupt the protective barrier of the skin [36,38].",1
"(Pesticides also are used outside the farm in urban schools, homes, and day-care centers for control of roaches, rats, and other vermin, and conceivably their peak period of application may differ seasonally from that on farms [33,40].)",1
"While farmers live longer than the population-at-large [41], and die less frequently from cancer in general [42], several epidemiologic studies have found an increased risk for brain cancer in this group [43–50].",1
"Farmers represent a diverse group (e.g., with dairy, field crop, hog, beef cattle, poultry, fish, marijuana, cotton, and organic), and the heterogeneity of brain cancer risk for farmers could reflect differences in activities, as well as in the type, magnitude, and seasonality of exposures.",1
"Within this window the peak for immune system priming or susceptibility is believed to vary differentially in response to presenting antigens [53,54].",1
"Contact with allergens during early childhood may enhance the risk of developing allergies later in life, especially in individuals with a predisposition for atopic and allergic conditions [51,55].",1
"Efforts to reduce allergen exposure immediately after birth often only delay the onset of allergic conditions, rather than preventing it, suggesting that immunologic memory may predate birth [15].",1
"While genetics constitute a key determinant of immunologic memory and immune system maturation [56–58], environmental factors also are believed to play an important role in the development of allergies, as illustrated by the discordance of allergies in twin studies [59], the increasing prevalence of atopic diseases over time [15,60], and the different incidence of allergies in immigrant and country of origin populations [61].",1
"In a number of studies, season of birth has been associated with the development of allergic conditions later in life, such as asthma [61–65], atopic dermatitis [66], house dust mite allergy [60,61,65,67–69], cockroach allergy [70,71], grass/birch/hay and other pollen allergy [51,60,63,67,68,72–76], animal dander allergy [51,67], mold allergy [74], food allergy [51,55,67], allergic rhinitis [62,77], and otherwise unspecified atopy (NOS) [55,78].",1
"Factors known to influence the development of asthma include race [80,81], low yearly family income [81], less than a high school education [81], residence in high poverty areas [81], exposure to urban air pollution [64] and childhood viral infections [64,82].",1
"Asthma, allergies, and other atopic diseases have been inversely associated with adult glioma risk in several epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses [83–93], although some reports do not support this conclusion [94–98].",1
The exact biologic mechanisms underlying a protective effect are not clearly understood.,1
"It has been suggested that the inverse association may reflect increased immune surveillance on the part of the atopic individual [91,93].",1
"Glioma patients are known to suffer from an impaired immune system [99], and the reduced association with allergies alternatively could be due to immunosuppression induced by the tumor ( i.e ., reverse causality) [84].",1
Inflammatory responses also may favor tumor development [93].,1
"Being raised on a farm [102–114] or in a rural area [115] has been shown in some studies to protect against asthma, hay fever, and atopic sensitization.",1
"Although farm children are exposed to higher concentrations of airborne allergens, paradoxically they become sensitized less often and manifest a weaker sensitization response than non-farm controls [113].",1
Some researchers have hypothesized that the protective effect may be attributed to a form of “tolerance”.,1
"Such tolerance could conceivably develop early in life, following repeated exposure to high levels of allergens such as organic dusts, fungi, and endotoxins; this is perhaps the result of component lipopolysaccharides that excite Th1 responses and suppress the development of immunoglobulin-E (IgE)-antibodies [109,116].",1
Little is known about specific determinants of asthma and atopy in the farm setting.,1
"Any relationship with glioma risk is probably complex and must be interpreted in light of differences in farming practices and the protective ability of farming environments, especially with respect to microbial exposures [102,103,114].",1
"While farmers and their families have greater contact with seasonal elements, they may be less prone to “sick building syndrome” than residents of urban areas [117].",1
"Other mitigating factors may include a greater intake of saturated fat in the form of milk and butter, as well as a greater number of older siblings living at home in rural/farm communities [116].",1
"Furthermore, farmers usually are non-smokers and healthier than the population-at-large [43,116,118–120].",1
"By self-selection, those who manifest seasonal allergies may choose a career path other than farming (i.e., healthy worker effect) [116].",1
"Differences in the definition of atopy, a lack of objective measures of atopy, residual confounding, and bias (e.g., detection, selection, interview, recall) are important to consider when interpreting the above studies [92,121].",1
"Furthermore, regarding the role of allergies and immunity, there is no clear trend toward a decreasing risk for glioma with younger ages at onset of the allergic condition [121].",1
"Interestingly, increased risk for glioma has been observed in patients with AIDS-related immuno-suppression [122–124], but not in those with iatrogenic immuno-suppression [125].",1
"Viruses\nEnvironmental exposures to viruses, microbes and other pathogens generally tend to occur more often in particular seasons [25,126,127].",1
Polyomaviruses have been shown to induce brain tumors in animals [128–131] and have been detected in human gliomas [132].,1
Other neuro-oncogenic viruses implicated in gliomas under laboratory conditions include human adenovirus type 12 and Rous sarcoma virus [133].,1
"Some tumor viruses must be injected in animals on the first day of life to be effective, although they may not cause cancer until years later [7].",1
Epidemiologic evidence in support of a viral or pathogenic etiology for adult brain tumors remains controversial and the windows of interest of these studies have been outside the perinatal period.,1
"In adults, Toxoplasma gondii infection has been associated with a greater prevalence of astrocytomas [134], while decreased glioma risk has been associated with a history of infections/colds [88], and chicken pox [135,136].",1
"On the other hand, increased risk for childhood brain tumors has been associated in some studies with a history of chicken pox [137], influenza [138,139], measles [138], general viral infections [140,141], and neonatal urinary tract infections [141].",1
Bacterial urinary tract infections have been shown to follow a well defined seasonal pattern with a peak in August [127].,1
"Similarly, seasonal occurrence has been observed for chicken pox, measles, influenza and many other common childhood infectious diseases [7,142].",1
A seasonal infectious etiology for disease is complicated by many factors [126].,1
The same infectious agent may present a different pattern of incidence depending on the host location.,1
A seasonal peak evident in the general population may not behave uniformly within certain subpopulations.,1
"Temperature, humidity, precipitation, and indoor air quality are among the mitigating factors that may affect the survival and transmissibility of a pathogen and explain different seasonal peaks for a disease in different studies.",1
"Furthermore, seasonal variation in immune function may increase host susceptibility to infections at certain times of the year [143,144].",1
"Given the rarity of some infections and brain tumors, the interpretability of seasonal patterns, or the lack thereof, may be confounded by time- and/or space-dependent factors [126].",1
"Maternal serum vitamin D levels tend to be closely correlated with infant cord serum levels [146,147].",1
"This light synthesized steroid, resulting from the absorption of ultraviolet B photons by 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin [148], has been suggested as a possible factor underlying the season of birth risk for adult gliomas observed in some studies [145].",1
"Levels of vitamin D are known to fluctuate depending on sunlight exposure, which is highest in the summer for the northern hemisphere and tends to increase for latitudes nearer the equator [145,148–150].",1
"Antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity of vitamin D3 has been noted in model glioma cell lines and a primary culture, as well as tumor tissue experiments [145].",1
"Further, prenatal vitamin D3 depletion has been associated with altered brain development in rodent studies [151].",1
"Vitamin D receptors are present in most cells and tissues in the body [152], including the brain [148], so this hormone is believed to play an important role in disease management and cancer prevention as a modulator of immune system activity [148,153–155].",1
"Children who live in polluted, inner city environments and who are deprived of regular sunlight exposure have been shown to suffer a higher prevalence of rickets (due to vitamin D deficiency) than children in rural areas [148].",1
"Seasonal variation in vitamin D levels also has been suggested as a factor differentially affecting newborn growth plate width, and this may explain why babies born in Australia around October (spring) are relatively heavier than those born at other times [156].",1
Diet\nThe “developmental plasticity hypothesis” refers to the critical developmental period in utero when the fetus is plastic and adaptively imprints to its environment.,1
"In utero adaptation may lead to lifelong changes in the body’s metabolism, hormone regulation, and the number of cells present in key organs [14,157,158].",1
"If this is the case, adult health outcomes may reflect season of birth if food intake is seasonal, and if exposure occurs at a critical stage of fetal development.",1
Foods high in N-nitroso compounds have been associated with an increased risk for brain tumors in some studies [162–165].,1
These compounds may be present in foods through their use as preservatives or in fertilizers [166].,1
"An 18-fold greater risk of primary adult brain tumors has been found among individuals who consumed large amounts of processed meats (high in N-nitroso content) and drank orange/grapefruit juice once per week or less, than among those who consumed less processed meat and drank orange/grapefruit juice more often [164].",1
"However, a recent multi-centered international case-control study of adult diet and brain tumor risk found no evidence of confounding or effect modification by vitamin supplementation, especially in the association between consumption of cured meats (containing high levels of nitrates) and gliomas [167].",1
"High birth weight is an important predictor of adult obesity [171], and a higher body mass index (BMI) has been linked to greater risk for adult-onset glioma [172].",1
"In children, high birth weight has been associated with increased risk for astrocytoma and medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) [173].",1
Temporal patterns in birth weight may result from seasonal variations in food availability.,1
"Interestingly, very low birth weight has been associated with left- or mix-handedness [175,176], a factor associated in some studies with season of birth [177] and reduced glioma risk [178].",1
"Handedness\nHandedness is believed to be determined in utero [179], possibly through hormonal influences [180–183], and has been linked with immune disease [184,185], various developmental learning disorders [184], epilepsy [186], and breast cancer risk in both pre- and post-menopausal women [187–190].",1
"Exposure to a high level of testosterone during the earlier part of pregnancy is thought to promote right brain development and influence hand preference, although the evidence in support of a relationship is not conclusive [191].",1
"Testosterone, progesterone, oestradiol, and lutenising hormone levels in women have been reported to be higher in spring than in autumn [192–194].",1
Results from several studies hint that non-genetic factors may play an important role in the determination of handedness.,1
"Similarly, left-handedness has been linked to congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a condition characterized by high in utero levels of androgeizing hormones [197].",1
"Of note, brain tumors are known to contain sex steroid receptors (e.g., estrogen, androgen, progestin) [198], and sex hormones have been shown to promote brain tumors in animal studies [199,200].",1
"Mice reared under conditions favoring the right limb develop a right-limb preference, and vice versa [201], further suggesting that environmental factors influence handedness.",1
"Additionally, the discordance of handedness in twin studies illustrates that genetics alone cannot explain the development of handedness [202–207].",1
Being right-handed has been associated with a greater risk for glioma than being left-handed or ambidextrous [178].,1
"However, for left-handed and ambidextrous participants born from late fall through early spring, glioma risk also has been shown to be higher than for those born at other times of the year [16].",1
"A study of 15,390 Brazilian students was unable to detect a difference in the season of birth between right- and left-handers.",1
"The putative connection between handedness, season of birth, and glioma risk remains difficult to interpret.",1
"For example, glioma risk is greater for males than females [2], yet the pattern of seasonal influence upon handedness does not vary significantly between females and males [177].",1
A higher incidence of sinistrality has been observed for individuals born in winter and autumn than for those born summer and spring [191].,1
"The incidence of left-handedness is disproportionately higher among males [202], a finding which is consistently observed across species [201,209–212].",1
"Overall, handedness appears to be a surrogate marker for an underlying but unidentified risk factor that interacts with seasonality and other factors to possibly explain glioma risk.",1
Discussion\nSeason of birth in its own right cannot be deemed a cause for glioma.,1
"Rather, it is a surrogate marker for underlying risk factors that may offer subtle clues about the possible perinatal etiology of adult gliomas.",1
There is probably no specific etiologic agent acting in isolation that completely explains a season of birth association with adult glioma risk.,1
"If an association exists the effect probably represents the interplay between various environmental, genetic, lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors, operating on mother and child within a precise window of vulnerability.",1
The mechanism of action may involve epigenetic processes or DNA changes with the capacity to modulate or influence oncogenic outcomes in the distant future.,1
"A patient’s innate and adaptive immune response and a host of hormonal and metabolic factors, likely play important and closely interrelated roles in understanding the complex biologic and etiologic mechanisms in the season of birth effect for adult gliomas.",1
"In the studies conducted to date, risk estimates and p-values for the association between season of birth and glioma risk have been nominal to borderline in strength.",1
"However, a weak association does not necessarily imply the absence of causality, nor is a strong association necessary or sufficient for causality [213,214].",1
The ability to find associations between specific seasonal risk factors occurring around the time of birth and adult glioma incidence is limited by the rarity of this cancer in the population and the vast time period from exposure to disease.,1
"While the risk factors outlined in this review do not conflict with our current understanding of the natural history of cancer or glioma specifically, the evidence in support of a causal relationship has not been consistent.",1
"To some degree, effect modification or publication bias may explain the inconsistencies.",1
"At minimum, if a causal relationship exists, season of birth meets the criteria of temporality as the period surrounding birth clearly predates disease occurrence.",1
"However, the exact window of exposure when the underlying risk factor(s) most occur to cause disease is unknown.",1
"On the present evidence, it is not possible to definitively answer the question of how season of birth influences glioma risk, or to favor any specific hypothesis.",1
"Many questions remain and future research will benefit from focused studies aimed at specific exposures and subpopulations, allowing for more detailed analyses by histologic subtypes.",1
Asthma and Allergic Diseases in Pregnancy: A Review\n\nAbstract\nAsthma and allergic disorders can affect the course and outcome of pregnancy.,1
Pregnancy itself may also affect the course of asthma and related diseases.,1
Optimal management of these disorders during pregnancy is vital to ensure the welfare of the mother and the baby.,1
Specific pharmacological agents for treatment of asthma or allergic diseases must be cautiously selected and are discussed here with respect to safety considerations in pregnancy.,1
"Although most drugs do not harm the fetus, this knowledge is incomplete.",1
Any drug may carry a small risk that must be balanced against the benefits of keeping the mother and baby healthy.,1
"The goals and principles of management for acute and chronic asthma, rhinitis, and dermatologic disorders are the same during pregnancy as those for asthma in the general population.",1
"[""Diagnosis of allergy during pregnancy should mainly consist of the patient's history and in vitro testing.""]",1
"The assured and well-evaluated risk factors revealed for sensitization in mother and child are very limited, to date, and include alcohol consumption, exposure to tobacco smoke, maternal diet and diet of the newborn, drug usage, and insufficient exposure to environmental bacteria.",1
"Consequently, the recommendations for primary and secondary preventive measures are also very limited in number and verification.",1
"Allergies or hyperreactivities have been classified by Gells and Coombs into types I through IV, with types I, II, and III being mediated by antibodies or immune complexes and type IV reactions as well as chronic stages of allergic diseases being mediated by T cells [1].",1
The focus of this review is set on asthma and type I allergy associated with pregnancy.,1
Cross-linking is more likely if the allergen occurs in dimerized or multimerized form [3].,1
Immediate-phase type I allergic symptoms usually occur within several minutes after allergen contact.,1
"The newly synthesized cytokines and chemokines lead to the late-phase reaction associated with tissue edema by recruitment and activation of additional inflammatory cells, including basophils, eosinophils, and T helper type 2 (Th2) lymphocytes [6].",1
Part 1: Specific Allergic Diseases in Pregnancy\n\nEpidemiology: Prevalence of Asthma and Allergy in Pregnant Women\nAllergic sensitization to common allergens can be detected in approximately 25% to 35% of the general population in industrialized countries [7].,1
"Other allergic diseases that may complicate pregnancy include conjunctivitis, acute urticaria, anaphylaxis, food allergy, and drug allergy.",1
Asthma and allergic disorders can affect the course and outcome of the pregnancy.,1
Pregnancy itself may also affect the course of asthma and other diseases [10].,1
Optimal management of these disorders during pregnancy is vital to ensure the welfare of the mother and the baby.,1
Specific pharmacological agents for treatment of asthma or allergic diseases must be cautiously selected.,1
"Although most drugs do not harm the fetus, this knowledge is incomplete.",1
Any drug may carry a small risk that must be balanced against the benefits of keeping the mother and baby healthy.,1
"Safety of Asthma and Allergy Medication in Pregnancy\nThe ideal situation during pregnancy is ""no pharmacological therapy,"" especially during the first trimester.",1
"However, the reality is that medications must be considered for pregnant patients with medical disorders, based on a thorough appreciation of the potential deleterious effects of untreated disease.",1
"For instance, women with asthma or allergic diseases require drug therapy during pregnancy to prevent symptoms severe enough to be life threatening to the mother or the fetus (eg, severe acute asthma that can result in hypoxia).",1
"Of the available medications for allergic rhinitis (AR), chlorpheniramine is recommended as the first-generation antihistamine of choice for use during pregnancy [11].",1
"Based on the information available (Table1), loratadine or cetirizine may be considered the second-generation antihistamines of choice.",1
The decision whether to use a first-generation or second-generation antihistamine for a particular patient must be individualized.,1
"Caption (TABLE-WRAP): TABLE 1\n\nRecommendations for Treatment of Asthma and Allergies in PregnancyDrugs preferred for use during pregnancy\u2003Anti-inflammatory: cromolyn beclomethasone, prednisone\u2003Bronchodilator: inhaled β2-adrenergic agonist, theophylline\u2003Antihistamine: chlorpheniramine, tripelennamine\u2003Decongestant: pseudoephedrine, oxymetazoline\u2003Cough: guaifenesin, dextromethorphan\u2003Antibiotic: amoxicillinDrugs that generally should be avoided during pregnancy\u2003α-Adrenergic compounds (other than pseudoephedrine)\u2003Epinephrine (other than for anaphylaxis)\u2003Iodides\u2003Sulfonamides (in late pregnancy)\u2003Tetracyclines\u2003Quinolones\nAdapted from the NAEPP expert group report [21].",1
"Although most of the existing data regarding asthma and allergy medications during pregnancy have not demonstrated adverse effects, data regarding the use of oral corticosteroids have not been totally reassuring.",1
"In a recently published meta-analysis,[12] 6 cohort studies evaluating the relationship between first trimester maternal use of oral corticosteroids and congenital malformations did not show an increased risk of congenital malformations (summary odds ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.08-2.60).",1
"However, meta-analysis of the 4 case-control studies revealed a significantly increased risk of oral clefts in infants of corticosteroid-treated mothers (odds ratio, 3.35; confidence interval 1.97-5.69) [12].",1
"Other adverse outcomes have also been attributed to oral corticosteroids, including an increased risk of preeclampsia,[13,14] preterm birth,[12,15] and lower birth weight [16].",1
"However, the potential side effects of any drug must be balanced against the risks of the mother or the infant having inadequately treated disease.",1
"In the case of asthma, the risk of uncontrolled severe asthma (which may include maternal or fetal mortality) would usually be the greater risk, suggesting that oral corticosteroids must still be used when indicated for the management of severe gestational asthma.",1
These alterations are primarily the result of hormonal effects.,1
They could potentially affect the course of asthma and predispose to hypoxia.,1
"Preexisting asthma symptoms may worsen, improve, or remain unchanged during pregnancy.",1
Each of these 3 possibilities are observed in about one third of all cases [10].,1
Caption (FIG): FIGURE 1\n\nPotential side effects of any drug taken during pregnancy by the mother must be balanced againts the risk of the mother of the infant suffering from inadequately treated symptoms .,1
"In general, patients with severe asthma are more likely to experience worsening of their disease during pregnancy.",1
"Alterations in maternal immunity, particularly a decrease in cell-mediated immunity, may predispose the pregnant asthmatic to infections and thus to acute exacerbations of asthma.",1
"Severe or poorly controlled asthma may be associated with an increased risk of fetal death, low birth weight, congenital malformations,[18] and parental complications [14].",1
Pregnant patients with severe or uncontrolled asthma should be considered high-risk and be treated promptly and optimally to ensure a favorable outcome for mother and baby.,1
"Thus, optimal asthma treatment is crucial, as the risk of preeclampsia, premature birth, low birth weight,[19] and maternal and neonatal hypoxia and morbidity [10,20] posed by undertreated asthma may be greater than that from the use of oral steroids for the treatment of asthma.",1
"Management of Chronic Asthma\nThe goals of management during pregnancy are the same as those for asthma in general, including prevention of severe exacerbations, improvement of quality of life (no interference with sleep or daily activities), and maintenance of normal lung function.",1
Frequent regular follow-up visits to or by health professionals skilled in managing asthma are essential to ensure optimal success and safety of asthma management during pregnancy.,1
"The importance of effective 3-way communication among the patient, asthma specialist, and obstetrician cannot be overemphasized.",1
Patients should have easy access to their physicians during times of increased symptoms.,1
The recommendations for medical treatment have been summarized by a Working Group of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program in a report on managing asthma during pregnancy [21].,1
"A stepwise approach is suggested for medical treatment, where inhaled salbutamol is the preferred short-acting β agonist with an outstanding safety profile, and inhaled corticosteroids (eg, budesonide) should be used confidently as long-term control medications.",1
Salmeterol is the preferred agent when long-acting β2 agonists are indicated in pregnant women as add-on treatment of persistent asthma.,1
Leukotriene modifiers may be used as alternative add-on treatment; montelukast and zafirlukast are the preferred antileukotriene drugs (but zileuton is not).,1
Patients whose asthma is not controlled with maximal doses of bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents may need systemic corticosteroids.,1
The lowest possible effective dose (alternate-day dose or single daily dose) should be used.,1
"Patients must be monitored closely for potential adverse effects of corticosteroids, especially gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth retardation.",1
"Management of Acute Asthma\nTreatment of acute asthma is similar to that recommended for nonpregnant patients including inhaled β2agonists, oxygen (essential), and corticosteroids (oral or parenteral) [22].",1
It is also reasonable to add nebulized ipratropium bromide in patients who do not respond to β2agonists.,1
Intravenous aminophylline is not generally recommended in the emergency management of acute asthma (because of its potentially harmful effects) but may be used in pregnant patients hospitalized for acute asthma (theophylline levels should be monitored).,1
Criteria for admission and hospital management of the pregnant woman with acute asthma should be more lenient than for nonpregnant patients.,1
Intravenous magnesium sulfate may be beneficial in acute severe asthma as an adjunct to inhaled β2agonists and corticosteroids.,1
Pregnancy-associated hormones have direct and indirect effects on nasal blood flow and mucous glands.,1
Allergic rhinitis is often preexisting but may occur or be recognized for the first time during pregnancy.,1
"As with asthma, preexisting AR can worsen, improve, or remain unchanged during pregnancy [27].",1
"Furthermore, during pregnancy, nasal congestion can worsen, although the exact mechanism for this is not defined.",1
"The general principles of treatment of pregnant women with asthma [21,22,28] and AR [29] do not differ from the stepwise approach recommended for treatment of nonpregnant women.",1
"Intranasal cromolyn, intranasal steroids, and montelukast are the preferred drugs for the treatment of rhinitis because of the low risk of systemic effects.",1
"Second-generation antihistamines such as loratadine or cetirizine [21,29] can also be used (after the first trimester--as a general precaution).",1
"Anaphylaxis\nThe exact prevalence of anaphylaxis during pregnancy is unknown, but it is extremely uncommon [30].",1
The fetus seems to be relatively protected from anaphylaxis perhaps because the placenta does not transmit specific IgE antibodies to the fetus [31].,1
"However, maternal hypoxia or hypotension associated with anaphylaxis may be catastrophic not only to the mother but also to her fetus.",1
"Maternal anaphylaxis has been associated with fetal distress, brain injury, and fetal loss (presumably because of diminished uteroplacental perfusion), as well as neonatal death [32-35].",1
Any agent that can cause anaphylaxis in the nonpregnant state could also cause anaphylaxis in the susceptible or sensitized pregnant patient.,1
Even breast-feeding has been associated with anaphylaxis in 2 postpartum women.,1
Changing levels of progesterone and triggering by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were suggested as potential causes [36].,1
"Of the routine antianaphylaxis medications, epinephrine and diphenhydramine have been implicated in causing fetal malformations.",1
"However, the tentative nature of these data and the lack of equally effective substitutes justify their use in pregnancy for this life-threatening emergency.",1
Adequate intravascular volume repletion and oxygenation are particularly important in the management of anaphylaxis during pregnancy to prevent both maternal and fetal complications.,1
The pregnant hypotensive patient should be placed on her left side to prevent added positional hypotension resulting from compression of the inferior vena cava by the gravid uterus [37].,1
Intravenous epinephrine may be required despite its potential to cause decreased uteroplacental blood flow.,1
Glucocorticoids should be administered early to patients with severe anaphylaxis.,1
"For laryngeal spasm, intubation and, in rare cases, tracheotomy may be necessary.",1
Adverse Reactions to Food\nNo studies have focused explicitly on the prevalence of food allergy in pregnant women primarily because often the immune response in the offspring is the main focus of research.,1
"A cohort study on the Isle of Wight, United Kingdom, found adverse reactions to food in approximately 20% of 969 pregnant women [38].",1
"From murine studies, it may be expected that the sensitization of a mother to a (food) allergen will also bias the immune response of the offspring toward Th2 [39,40].",1
"However, the exact prevalence of allergic forms of dermatitis in the pregnant population is not known.",1
"The importance of an exacerbation of eczema and dermatitis during pregnancy should not be underestimated as readout of the atopic state, being of interest for the genetic predisposition of the newborn [42].",1
The course is variable [43].,1
"Treatment of atopic dermatitis during pregnancy should emphasize avoidance of triggering factors and reliance on topical treatment in an attempt to reduce dryness and pruritus, modulate inflammation, and treat secondary infections.",1
"Oral antihistamines should be avoided during the first trimester, unless definitely clinically indicated, and then should be used at the lowest effective dose, starting with chlorpheniramine, loratadine, or cetirizine.",1
"Topical steroids should be selected based on potency considerations, given the potential for systemic absorption and increased skin surface area of pregnancy.",1
Severe intrauterine growth retardation occurred in the infant of a mother who applied 40 mg/d of topical triamcinolone cream from week 12 to 29 of gestation to treat her atopic dermatitis [44].,1
"Topical corticosteroid treatment should be initiated when clinically indicated, with the least potent preparations such as hydrocortisone (0.5% to 1%), reserving more potent preparations for more recalcitrant areas in selected patients.",1
"The recently introduced topical calcineurin inhibitors (pimecrolimus and tacrolimus), although effective in the treatment of atopic eczema, are not recommended for use in pregnant patients because of the lack of safety data.",1
Urticaria and Angioedema\nThe pattern and causes of urticaria and angioedema in pregnancy are similar to those in nonpregnant patients.,1
"A unique form of urticaria associated with pregnancy, which tends to recur in subsequent pregnancies ( pregnancy urticaria ), has been reported [45].",1
"The pathogenesis of this condition is unknown, although there is speculation that it may be caused by allergic sensitization to endogenous hormones [46,47].",1
"Antihistamines should be avoided if possible, but if required, chlorpheniramine, loratadine, or cetirizine may be used.",1
"Rarely, systemic corticoids may be used for severe recalcitrant urticaria and angioedema during pregnancy.",1
Drug Allergy\nThere is a lack of data on the prevalence of adverse drug reactions during pregnancy.,1
Diagnosis of Allergy During Pregnancy\nThe diagnosis of allergy in pregnant women should focus on a detailed medical history and symptom analysis.,1
"For diagnosis, a diary of allergy symptoms and avoidance of specific allergens accompanied by monitoring of changes of allergic symptoms may be helpful.",1
"However, it is important not to put the mother on a rigid elimination diet because this could negatively influence the nutrition of both the mother and the growing infant [48].",1
"In vitro diagnostic tools such as serological testing, for example, radioallergosorbent test for type I allergy or the lymphocyte transformation test for type IV allergy [49] are preferred to in vivo testing.",1
"Although not contraindicated, skin prick testing should be postponed until after birth because of possible, although rare, anaphylactic reactions to skin prick testing.",1
Only in situations where in vitro diagnosis is not conclusive and the mother is at risk for developing allergy symptoms should in vivo skin tests be used.,1
"Importantly, when performing in vivo testing such as skin tests or provocation test, the exceptional immunologic status accompanying pregnancy should be considered when interpreting test results.",1
Any unexpected test result and any symptoms that change over time should be reevaluated after pregnancy.,1
"In addition, the attending physician should bear in mind that some symptoms may be a direct result of pregnancy and not allergy related, for example, vasomotor rhinitis in the last trimester [51] and gestational urticaria (pruritic urticarial papules and plaques in pregnancy) [52].",1
"Nonpharmacological Management of Allergic Diseases During Pregnancy\nMothers with diagnosed allergy should avoid exposure to and contact with specific allergens (including food allergens) and should especially avoid the inhalation of potent triggers for asthma, such as animal dander, house dust, tobacco smoke, and irritating pollutants [22].",1
"Hyposensitization (immunotherapy), which may be selectively indicated in certain patients with AR, bee venom sensitivity, and asthma should not be initiated during pregnancy because of the risk of systemic reactions.",1
"For patients who were already on immunotherapy before the pregnancy, maintenance treatment may be continued safely during pregnancy.",1
"However, the allergen dose should not be increased during pregnancy but rather reduced if necessary [29].",1
"[""Allergy diagnosis during pregnancy should preferentially consist of recording the patient's history for precise recommendation of allergen avoidance and in vitro testing only.""]",1
"In vivo testing should generally be postponed until after pregnancy, unless diagnosis for therapeutic intervention is urgently needed.",1
Immunotherapy may be continued as maintenance treatment but should not be initiated during pregnancy.,1
Part 2: Prevention of Asthma and Allergies in Early Life\n\nInfants With High-Risk of Allergy\nThe potential risk for the development of atopy among newborns is high.,1
Genetic components and complex environmental factors contribute to the etiology of asthma and atopic diseases.,1
"To date, there are no biomarkers that can reliably predict which newborn will develop atopy.",1
"However, an atopic family history has been recognized to be a simple and inexpensive risk indicator.",1
"The degree of risk seems to be directly related to the family history of allergy and especially to maternal atopy,[53] particularly when the mother has diagnosed atopic eczema and has elevated IgE levels.",1
"The influence of maternal sensitization on the immune response of newborns was recently shown in a human observational study of AR, in which only the organ-specific symptoms of the mother but not the father were demonstrated to be relevant for the imprinting of the child [55].",1
"However, sensitization may not be restricted to the organ at which the mother experiences allergic symptoms because asthma or wheezing in children was associated not only with asthma and AR, but also with eczema or any allergic disease in their parents and siblings [56,57].",1
Transfer Mechanisms of Allergy (Immunopathogenesis of Atopy)\nThe allergic status of the mother can potentially affect the immune response of the offspring through numerous factors that are transferable via the placenta or breast milk.,1
The direct transfer of food or inhalant allergens via the placenta or breast milk has long been recognized [58-60].,1
"In addition, antibodies can be transferred to the child via placenta (IgG, IgA) or breast milk (IgA, IgG, IgM, IgE),[61,62] and even a transamniotic transfer of intact maternal IgE into the amniotic fluid can occur [63].",1
Only a very limited number of human studies on the maternofetal transfer of cytokines and chemokines are available.,1
The transfer of maternal cytokines was confirmed in a study of suckling piglets [65].,1
In vivo and in vitro models have shown that such transfer may lead to reduced neonatal immunity.,1
"Also chemokines, for example, IL-8, a cytokine that is regulated on activation with normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), IFN-γ -inducible protein 10, and monokine induced by IFN-γ have been detected in breast milk [66,67].",1
"However, cytokines and other soluble inflammation markers are found in breast milk from atopic as well as in nonatopic women.",1
"Another factor that should be considered is the composition of fatty acids present in breast milk, which may influence the immune response of the child [68].",1
This seems to be important because allergen-specific T cells transferred from 1 mouse mother to another can transmit asthma risk to the offspring of the recipient mouse mother [69].,1
Trafficking of cells could therefore be responsible for the passing of allergy risk from mother to fetus.,1
Environmental Risk Factors for Atopy\nThe causes of allergy in general and of specific sensitization in newborns in particular have not yet been completely determined.,1
"Besides the role of genetic predisposition, some factors have been identified that may either contribute to sensitization of the mother and to the subsequent transfer of a predisposition for allergy to the offspring, or that directly induce sensitization in offspring that manifests shortly after birth or at a young age.",1
Exposure to Tobacco Smoke\nOne of the most frequently discussed risk factors for induction of sensitization in all populations and age groups is tobacco smoke (active smoking or the passive environmental exposure).,1
"In a recent mouse study, exposure to smoke in utero induced a higher risk of sensitization against allergens in adult age in the offspring [70].",1
"Accordingly, in human blood samples, Th2 cytokines responsible for a predisposition toward allergy were elevated in the neonates only of mothers who had smoked during pregnancy [71].",1
"Alarmingly, in the birth cohort study from the Isle of Wight, about 43% of children had been exposed to environmental tobacco smoke during their first year of life [38].",1
Alcohol Consumption\nAlcohol consumption by the mother during pregnancy is associated with higher total IgE levels in cord blood [76].,1
Maternal Diet\nThe maternal dietary component consumed during gestation could influence the immune status of the child.,1
"For instance, different polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been shown to differently influence the outcome of eczema in the child.",1
"A diet higher in n-6 PUFAs--as present, for example, in margarine and vegetable oils--seems to be more likely to induce eczema than n-3 PUFAs, which are for instance found in fish [79].",1
"Accordingly, another study showed that fish consumption decreased eczema [80].",1
"However, it may not be the absolute content but the ratio of n-6 to n-3 PUFAs that may influence the development of either tolerance or sensitization to food, as a high ratio of 9 of n-6/n-3 in the diet of the mother prevented the induction of oral tolerance to ovalbumin in the offspring in a rat study [81].",1
"Celery and citrus fruits seem to increase the risk of food sensitization, whereas vegetable oils, raw sweet pepper, and again citrus fruit increase sensitization to respiratory antigens [79].",1
"Interestingly, apples consumed during pregnancy were able to decrease wheezing in children [80].",1
"According to a directive of the Commission of European Communities from 2005, the most allergenic foods have to be labeled because of their potency of eliciting severe allergic reactions: these are crustacean, fish, nuts, milk, egg, wheat/gluten, peanuts, soy, sesame, mustard, and celery.",1
It has long been proposed that the mother should avoid such foods containing potential allergens during pregnancy and lactation to prevent food sensitization in the child.,1
"However, recent studies suggest that allergen exposure may be necessary to induce tolerance, and moreover, a balanced diet prevents malnutrition of both mother and child [82].",1
"Furthermore, alterations of the maternal diet, that is, avoidance of milk and egg consumption during pregnancy did not seem to lower the risk of sensitization in the child [83,84].",1
"Studies found that about 70% of pregnant women are affected by these symptoms during their last trimenon,[85] and 50% of them are likely to take acid-suppressing medication.",1
"However, recent animal and human studies indicate that acid suppression and the resulting elevated pH in the stomach may lead to an increased risk of sensitization to food [86,87].",1
This sensitization of the mother was shown to lead to an increased risk of food allergy in the newborn in a BALB/c mouse model [39].,1
"As previously discussed, an allergic status of the mother has the potency to affect the immune response of the offspring by numerous factors transferable via placenta or breast milk and even via the transamniotic route, for instance, intact maternal IgE in amniotic fluid, maternal DNA in cord blood, leukocytes, and chemokines such as IL-8, RANTES, interferon-γ-inducible protein 10, or monokine induced by IFN-γ, allergens, as well as antibodies.",1
"Furthermore, the offspring of sensitized mothers are prone to experience suppression and a later onset of normal levels of the Th1 cytokine IFN-γ because of a lower frequency of IFN-γ-producing cells, and therefore a further bias toward a Th2 immune response.",1
"[""Infant's Diet\nRegarding the nutrition of the baby, reduced breast-feeding and early introduction of solid food have been discussed as confounders to allergy development.""]",1
"However, a randomized trial revealed quite contrary that promoted and prolonged (exclusive) breast-feeding is not able to prevent development of allergy or asthma in children at the age of about 6 years [88].",1
"In addition, a systematic review of several studies found no clear negative association between early solid food introduction and the development of asthma, food allergy, AR, or animal dander allergy [89].",1
"The impact of these 2 factors for sensitization to other allergens, such as aeroallergens, has not been investigated.",1
"However, 1 study showed that adolescents who had been born prematurely had a substantially decreased expiratory volume and increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness, making them potential candidates for developing asthma [91].",1
"Birth by Cesarean Delivery\nThe delivery of a baby by cesarean delivery has been suggested to be associated with increased risk of allergies and atopic diseases in the child, most probably because of a lower bacterial exposure for the child.",1
"In a recent population-based cohort study in Norway, it was shown that a positive association exists for cesarean delivery and risk of asthma in the child (especially when the cesarean delivery was performed because of an emergency in contrast to a planned section) [92].",1
"Bager and colleagues [93,94] also showed an increased risk for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and possibly for food allergies in their meta-analysis.",1
"However, because of the low numbers of an allergic outcome associated to cesarean delivery (only 1%-4%), the authors concluded that the epidemic increase of allergic diseases might not be attributable to the increased numbers of cesarean delivery.",1
Insufficient Exposure to Environmental Bacteria\nThe hygiene hypothesis states that low exposure of the mother during pregnancy and of the newborn in early life to environmental bacteria contributes to a Th2-biased immune response.,1
This hypothesis has been confirmed by several experimental animal and epidemiological human studies (reviewed in Renz et al [95]).,1
"Preventive Measures for Mother and Child\nStrategies for prevention of atopic diseases may be categorized as primary, secondary, and tertiary.",1
Primary prevention has been suggested for those newborns who have at least 1 parent or sibling with proven atopy.,1
"However, it must be borne in mind that a proportion of children who develop atopic manifestations in the first years of life come from families in which neither parents nor siblings are atopic.",1
"This suggests the possibility that some infants who would never have developed atopy would undergo preventive regimens, whereas others who become symptomatic in early life would not have received adequate advice.",1
Preventive pharmacotherapy and immunotherapy will not be discussed.,1
Smoking\nMaternal smoking and passive exposure to smoke should both be avoided.,1
"This is especially important for pregnant asthmatic patients, in whom smoking-related morbidity is independent of--and adds to--the morbidity resulting from asthma [96].",1
"Although there are contradicting epidemiological and experimental results regarding the direct influence of smoking on total and specific IgE production,[97,98] smoking should nevertheless be avoided for obvious reasons, such as carcinogenic smoke constituents and the vasoconstrictive effect of nicotine.",1
Alcohol\nAlcohol intake should be avoided by the pregnant mother because of well-known toxic effects on both mother and fetus.,1
"Moreover, alcohol consumption has been shown to induce higher IgE levels against aeroallergens in atopic patients [76].",1
"[""Maternal Diet During Pregnancy\nA Cochrane database meta-analysis of 4 clinical studies concluded that antigen avoidance during pregnancy is unlikely to reduce the child's risk of developing atopic disease, and dietary restrictions could adversely affect maternal or fetal nutrition [99].""]",1
"Although previously suggested that pregnant women with risks avoid peanuts, a subsequent study found no evidence of prenatal sensitization from maternal consumption of peanuts [100].",1
"In addition, recent publications revealed that an effect (positive or negative) of peanut avoidance on sensitization was not detectable (although too few valuable subjects and the observational nature of the reports reduce the ability to make firm conclusions) [101,102].",1
"Generally, there is a lack of evidence for maternal pregnancy restriction diets.",1
"Additional recent studies about pregnancy diets reveal that components other than specific allergens, such as fat, may influence atopy outcomes [103,104].",1
"Therefore, no special diet for the mother is required during pregnancy.",1
"On the contrary, the diet should be well balanced and consist of as many different nutrients as possible, as the current literature suggests that antigens obtained via the oral route during pregnancy and lactation are needed to develop allergen tolerance in the child [105].",1
"In line with this, there was no association between maternal intake of foods during pregnancy and the occurrence of asthma, respiratory disease, or allergy in 5-year-old children [80].",1
"Furthermore, many studies found no benefit of a restricted diet avoiding the consumption of allergy-inducing food during pregnancy [82].",1
"However, if the mother is already allergic or if there is a family history of atopy or allergy, food comprising potential allergens should be avoided.",1
"In such instances, the avoidance of peanuts, nuts, fish, eggs, and sesame during the last 3 months of pregnancy may have a protective effect [106].",1
"In this respect, government recommendations must be carefully worded, as 1 study found that avoidance of peanuts was overdone among pregnant women: although such avoidance was recommended only for women with atopy risk, 65% of all pregnant women had avoided peanuts during pregnancy (42% of all women who responded had heard about the advice, eg, from their midwives, and 50% subsequently changed their diet) [101].",1
"Numerous individual nutrients consumed by the mother during pregnancy have been suggested as being preventive for development of atopic diseases in the child; these include apples or fish,[80] vitamin D,[107] vitamin E,[108] and various probiotics, the latter having been shown to be effective in mouse models [109] and human studies [110].",1
"Antiacids During Pregnancy\nRecent studies have indicated that acid-suppressing medications can promote sensitization in adults [86,87].",1
"Therefore, it is suggested that antiacids should be taken only when prescribed by an attending physician to the childbearing mother.",1
"Treatment of reflux during pregnancy should focus on nonpharmacological measures, such as avoiding large meals shortly before bedtime, sleeping with the upper body elevated, and avoiding extensive consumption of coffee, sweets, and fatty foods.",1
"In addition, smoking is a cause of reflux and should be avoided.",1
"If these measures are unsuccessful, then prescription of antiacid drugs should be considered, for example, in the form of a step-up program beginning with antacids, and in case of failure with histamine-2 receptor antagonists, whereas proton pump inhibitors should only be used in women with intractable symptoms or complicated reflux disease [111,112].",1
"Avoidance of Other Allergens During Pregnancy\nAvoidance of other allergens is necessary only if the pregnant patients are already sensitized (eg, to cats, dogs, horses, or house dust).",1
"However, allergen avoidance may not be preventive or practical in all cohorts [113].",1
"Maternal Diet During Lactation\nRegarding maternal lactation diets, a Cochrane database meta-analysis [99] found some evidence of reduced atopic dermatitis, but suggested that more studies are needed.",1
A previous expert review that was not a structured meta-analysis and did not exclude as many studies as the Cochrane review concluded that special maternal lactation avoidance diets were unnecessary [114].,1
"During lactation, a special diet for the mother (or, if not breast-feeding, hypoallergenic formula nutrition for the infant) should be considered only in individuals with an established atopy risk or existing allergy [82,115].",1
"Diet of the Infants\nAs mentioned previously, for breast-feeding, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether it is more protective against allergies and asthma than bottle feeding because in a recent study, prolonged and exclusive breast-feeding could not decrease the rate of allergies or asthma in children [88].",1
"[""Furthermore, there are data supporting that breast-feeding should not be continued beyond 9 months of age because doing so seems to increase the child's risk for atopic diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and food hypersensitivity [116].""]",1
Some studies investigated the effect of reduced exposure of infants to allergen-provoking food.,1
"In cases where a reduced sensitization to food was found, this protective effect was short-lived and was primarily observed during the first year of life.",1
"[""As a further preventive measure, the early introduction of solid food (ie, baby food from jars and table food) into the infant's diet has to be revisited.""]",1
"It has been suggested that foods containing allergy-provoking proteins such as milk, egg, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and seafood should not be introduced into the diet of the child before the age of 6 months to 3 years [117].",1
"However, contact with and exposure to antigens may be necessary in early life to develop tolerance in the immune system [118].",1
"Thus far, studies on delayed introduction of solids led to conflicting results.",1
"Summary\nBased on currently available evidence, guidelines for primary and secondary prevention of allergic disease can be summarized as follows (Table3).",1
"Caption (TABLE-WRAP): TABLE 3\n\nPrimary Prevention of Asthma and Allergies in Early LifePreventive Measures \u2003Smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke should be avoided, especially during pregnancy and early childhood\u2003Alcohol consumption should be avoided by the mother during pregnancy and lactation\u2003Damp housing conditions should be avoided and indoor air pollutants reduced, especially for high-risk children (history of atopy or allergy in a first-degree relative)\u2003Breast-feeding should be performed exclusively until 6 months with no special diet for the lactating mother (except when the mother is already diagnosed with food allergy)\u2003Nonprescription drugs should be avoided during pregnancy and lactation unless recommended by a physician\n\nSmoking and Alcohol\nSmoking and passive exposure to cigarette smoke as well as alcohol consumption should be strictly avoided.",1
"Diet\nThere should be no special diet for the mother during pregnancy and lactation, unless the mother or child has a diagnosed food sensitization.",1
"[""In infants with risk of allergy, introduction of solid foods in general should be postponed until 6 months of age, milk products until 12 months, hen's egg until 24 months, and peanut, tree nuts, fish, and seafood until at least 36 months.""]",1
"Other Allergens\nAvoidance of allergens (pets, house dust, contact allergens, drugs) is not recommended except when sensitization has already been diagnosed.",1
Reflux Treatment\nPregnancy-associated reflux should be treated by nonpharmacological measures first.,1
"Atopy\nFor newborns at suspected risk for atopy, that is, with a history of atopy/allergy in a first-degree relative (parents, siblings), exposure to irritating air pollutants and airborne allergens such as molds should be minimized.",1
Breast-feeding\nInfants should be breast-fed for at least 4 months but no longer than 9 months.,1
"Special hypoallergenic formula (extensively hydrolyzed, not soy-based) should be used only if the child is diagnosed with atopy.",1
"Drugs\nAll nonprescription drugs (eg, antiacids) should be avoided during pregnancy and lactation unless recommended by a physician; patients should avoid intake of any medication including over-the-counter substances without consulting their physicians.",1
"Maternal Behaviors during Pregnancy Impact Offspring Obesity Risk\n\nAbstract\nThis study investigated the effects of maternal changes during pregnancy in diet, exercise, and psychosocial factors on offspring weight parameters at birth and 6 months.",1
"[""Mothers' eating behaviors during pregnancy, especially intake of sweets in OW/OB mothers, may have a lasting effect on child weight.""]",1
"Introduction\nRisk of obesity is shaped, in large part, by early life events starting during gestation.",1
"Studies have consistently found that higher maternal weight entering and during pregnancy increases risk for obesity among offspring in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood [1,2].",1
"While shared genes account for some of the similarity in maternal and offspring weight, evidence suggests that exposure to the uterine environment of an obese woman itself may directly program offspring obesity [3].",1
Both excessive [4] and inadequate [5] weight gain in the mother during gestation have been shown to lead to overly rapid fetal and infant growth rates and the programming of future risk of childhood overweight and metabolic disease.,1
"In the USA excessive GWG remains of predominant concern, as 60% of obese women gain more than recommended.",1
"Although maternal obesity and excessive GWG are both the result of energy intake exceeding energy expenditure, few studies have examined the specific influences of maternal dietary and exercise behaviors during pregnancy on offspring obesity risk.",1
Some evidence suggests that maternal prenatal intake of protein and fat [7–9] may be positively associated with birth weight.,1
"In animal models, prenatal exposures to overnutrition, high-fat and high-protein diets, “junk” food, and stress have been linked with greater adiposity in offspring [10–12].",1
"In nonpregnant humans, intake of soft drinks and junk food [13], higher dietary disinhibition [14], and restrictive dieting practices [15] have been positively correlated with overweight in children.",1
"However, little research has comprehensively examined the impact of maternal prenatal behaviors and psychosocial variables measured during pregnancy on subsequent offspring weight status at birth and 6 months.",1
This information is critical for the design of future intervention trials targeting obesity prevention in children.,1
"The primary aim of this study was to examine the impact of GWG, maternal eating and exercise behaviors, and psychosocial factors on offspring weight status.",1
"We hypothesized that offspring exposed to maternal obesity, excessive GWG, poor prenatal eating habits, less exercise in pregnancy, and greater maternal psychosocial distress during gestation would have higher weight for age (WFA) z -scores at birth and 6 months than nonexposed counterparts.",1
"Women ( n = 32) who developed gestational diabetes (GDM) were excluded from analysis a priori, given potential impact of GDM on both offspring and maternal weight gain [18].",1
"[""Overweight/Obese Mothers\nIn initial unadjusted analyses, several significant associations between overweight/obese mothers' prenatal behaviors and offspring WFA z -scores were observed (Table 2).""]",1
"Similarly, greater consumption of sweets early in pregnancy was significantly related to higher odds of macrosomia (OR = 1.1 (1.0, 1.2); P =\u2009\u20090.004) and WFA >90th percentile at birth (OR = 1.2 (1.1, 1.3); P =\u2009\u20090.002).",1
We examined GWG as an independent predictor and potential mediator of effects of maternal prenatal behaviors on offspring weight outcomes (Table 3).,1
"Examining GWG as a potential mediator, the effects of maternal prenatal behaviors on offspring weight outcomes were generally attenuated (i.e., P value increases between 0.01 and 0.06 across analyses) but not entirely removed when GWG was included in the models (Table 3).",1
"Normal Weight Mothers\nIn initial, unadjusted analyses, few significant correlations were found between prenatal behaviors and WFA z -scores at birth and 6 months in the offspring of normal weight mothers.",1
Only lower maternal fat intake (−0.22; P = 0.01) and trend for higher carbohydrate intake (0.16; P = 0.06) early in pregnancy were correlated with higher WFA z -scores at 6 months.,1
"Decreases in perceived stress during pregnancy were also independently related to higher odds of WFA >90th percentile (OR = 1.5 (1.1, 2.0); P =\u2009\u2009.01) but did not independently predict WFA z -scores at 6 months.",1
We also examined GWG as an independent predictor and potential mediator of effects of maternal prenatal behaviors on weight outcomes (Table 4).,1
"Examining GWG as a potential mediator, the effects of maternal prenatal behaviors on offspring weight outcomes were generally attenuated (Table 4).",1
"Discussion\nThis is one of the few studies to prospectively and simultaneously examine the impact of dietary, physical activity, and psychosocial parameters during pregnancy on the offspring weight status of overweight/obese and normal weight mothers.",1
"In obese mothers, we found that higher intake of sweets early in pregnancy was related to higher offspring weight status at birth and 6 months.",1
No prior studies have specifically examined impacts of maternal intake of sweets or soft drinks in pregnancy on offspring weight parameters.,1
"Our findings are consistent with some studies in nonpregnant adults and children showing a connection between higher intake of sweets and soft drinks and increased weight status [32], but conflicting results have been reported in association with GWG [33].",1
"Overall, the current study extends existing work by suggesting that exposure to foods or drinks high in sugar content early in gestation may predispose offspring to higher weight status early in infancy, independent of maternal GWG.",1
"In obese mothers, lower protein intake early in pregnancy and increased protein intakes over the course of the pregnancy were independently related to higher offspring weight at 6 months.",1
"Studies of protein intake in pregnancy have indicated that higher maternal protein intake was positively associated with birth weight [8,9], but there are notable exceptions [34,35] and most studies assessed diet later in gestation.",1
"Inverse associations between fat intake early in pregnancy and offspring weight have been reported previously [36], but not consistently [37].",1
"Nutritional effects on the fetus and mother may vary with prepregnancy body weight, trimester of exposure during pregnancy, and overall balance of macronutrients [8,38].",1
"Although a recent pilot randomized trial [39] found no significant impact of a low glycemic index diet on the offspring weight of overweight/obese mothers, future, larger randomized trials and research with more frequent assessments of diet in pregnancy are needed to untangle the relationship between weight status, time in pregnancy of nutrient exposures, and offspring weight outcomes.",1
"Surprisingly, physical activity and television viewing were not significantly related to offspring weight outcomes in normal weight or overweight/obese mothers.",1
"Also, increasing physical activity during pregnancy has been related to lower GWG in some [41] but not all [42] observational studies.",1
"Few clinical trial intervention studies have specifically measured changes in physical activity during pregnancy, but available evidence suggests little to no effect on maternal GWG [16,43].",1
Other research has found that a reduction in physical activity by bed rest was associated with an increase in infant birth weight [44].,1
"Overall, findings from the current study support a stronger role for maternal intake than expenditure in predicting offspring weight outcomes, but additional studies with objective measures of physical activity (e.g., accelerometry) are clearly needed.",1
"Increases in stress were related to lower offspring weight status in normal weight mothers (adjusted analyses) and overweight/obese mothers (unadjusted analyses), which is consistent with earlier research on stress in relation to inadequate GWG [45] and long-term offspring health [46].",1
"[""Overall, however, the current study's findings suggest that dietary variables may exert more of an effect than maternal psychosocial variables on offspring weight outcomes.""]",1
"Birth weight is an independent predictor of the development of obesity; however, increases in weight during the first 3–6 months of life are also influential on long-term increased risk of obesity [47,48].",1
Future research is needed to determine whether differences in postnatal feeding behaviors might explain differential growth rates in offspring of normal weight and overweight/obese mothers.,1
Excessive GWG was related to offspring weight but more strongly at birth than at 6 months and was not significantly related to changes in WFA z -scores.,1
"The association between GWG and offspring overweight may decrease as children grow older [49,50].",1
"Similarly, maternal prenatal behaviors may differentially impact birth and 6 months offspring weights (e.g., protein impacting 6 month but not birth weight in the current study).",1
"Interestingly, adjustment for GWG attenuated but generally did not completely remove the impact of dietary variables on offspring weight, particularly at 6 months.",1
This suggests that dietary exposures may impact offspring weight status above and beyond the potential influence of excessive GWG.,1
"Future research with more frequent assessments of offspring weight and, potentially, analysis of growth velocities [51] might better inform how and when nutrient exposures in pregnancy impact growth.",1
"This study is one of the first to prospectively examine impacts of prenatal diet, physical activity, and psychosocial exposures on offspring weight outcomes in a diverse sample.",1
"The sample was diverse but self-selected and free of diseases that might contraindicate participation in a lifestyle intervention study; thus, findings may not generalize to the population at large.",1
"A self-report, food frequency questionnaire was used, which is useful in ranking nutrient intakes of individual subjects but can be subject to bias, particularly in obese individuals [52].",1
"[""This study's focus was on predictors of large for gestational age at birth and 6 months, but future research is needed to examine predictors of small for gestational age, which may also predispose offspring to increased fat mass and incidence of metabolic syndrome as children and adults [53].""]",1
"[""Conclusions\nFindings from the current study indicate that excessive GWG and mothers' eating behaviors during pregnancy, especially intake of sweets in overweight/obese mothers, may influence offspring weight status early in infancy.""]",1
More research with larger sample sizes and frequent assessments of diet is needed to inform the impact of timing of nutrient exposures on offspring weight status.,1
"Also, future adequately powered randomized clinical trials are needed to determine whether modifying maternal prenatal behaviors and GWG can prevent offspring obesity.",1
"Identifying modifiable, prenatal causes of childhood obesity will inform future interventions targeting pregnancy as a “teachable moment” for primary and secondary obesity prevention.",1
"Effect on the incidence of pneumonia of vitamin D supplementation by quarterly bolus dose to infants in Kabul: a randomised controlled superiority trial\n\nAbstractSummary\n\nBackground\nVitamin D has a role in regulating immune function, and its deficiency is a suggested risk factor for childhood pneumonia.",1
Our aim was to assess whether oral supplementation of vitamin D3(cholecalciferol) will reduce the incidence and severity of pneumonia in a high-risk infant population.,1
"From 652 children during five separate periods of testing serum calcifediol, only one child in each of two testing periods had results greater than 375 nmol/L in the intervention group—a toxic level.",1
Introduction\nAfghanistan has the third highest mortality of children younger than 5 years in the world (257 per 1000 livebirths); a leading cause of this is pneumonia.,1
Two hospital-based case-control studies in Ethiopia1and India2suggest that vitamin D deficiency might substantially increase the risk of severe pneumonia in children.,1
Our systematic review identified one randomised placebo controlled trial3relating pneumonia or lower respiratory infections to vitamin D deficiency supplementation in young children.,1
"However, the risk of repeated pneumonia in the subsequent 3 months was 13% (relative risk [RR] 0·78, 95% CI 0·64–0·94; p=0·01) lower in the vitamin D3compared with the placebo group.3Other more recent studies assessing different outcomes in children or adults have conflicting findings on the effectiveness of vitamin D.\nThere is growing evidence of the vitamin D parancrine system enhancing innate immunity:4the activation of Toll-like receptors on monocytes and macrophages by microbial pathogens results in increased expression of CYP27B1 and vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) genes within these cells.",1
It has been suggested that vitamin D might be used in the treatment of opportunistic and antibiotic-resistant infections.,1
There is debate between investigators regarding concentrations that relate to optimum stores of vitamin D in the body.,1
"In children, serum calcifediol concentrations should be maintained at 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) or greater for skeletal benefits.6Vitamin D deficiency rickets in children younger than 5 years is an endemic problem in developing countries, ranging from 5–45%, even where sunlight is abundant,1,2,7,8and has also re-emerged in some developed countries.7,9\nIn people, the main source of vitamin D is through the action of ultraviolet B radiation on 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin, with small amounts derived from dietary sources.",1
"Therefore, breastmilk, a normally poor source of vitamin D,11becomes even more deficient.",1
"Furthermore, the common practice of swaddling infants might reduce exposure to sunlight.2Thus young children are at a high risk of vitamin D deficiency.",1
"A cross-sectional survey during the high-risk winter months in 2005 showed that greater than 95% of children younger than 5 years in a socioeconomically deprived part of Kabul had serum calcifediol levels of less than 37·5 nmol/L.12\nOn the basis of findings that vitamin D is an immunomodulator, that deficiency is a risk factor for pneumonia, and that quarterly supplementation had better compliance than daily or weekly supplementation,13,14we aimed to test the hypothesis that quarterly 100\u2008000 IU vitamin D supplementation would reduce the incidence of radiologically confirmed pneumonia by 35% in our study population.",1
"Our secondary hypotheses were that supplementation would reduce all pneumonias (radiologically confirmed or clinically defined), repeat episodes of pneumonia, hospital admissions, and all cause mortality.",1
"Procedures\nWe chose a quarterly supplementation regimen because in routine programme conditions a quarterly regimen is likely to have better adherence than a daily regimen,13,14and has been shown to be effective at maintaining the serum vitamin D concentration within normal ranges for 2–3 months in a French high-risk infant population.16The syringes containing vitamin D or placebo were stored in conditions recommended by the manufacturer—a dry cool environment—between 2 and 24 weeks before administration.",1
"Statistical analysis\nWe assumed that the incidence of the first or the only episode of pneumonia (first episode) in our placebo group would be 0·0585 per child per year based on the report that the incidence of acute lower respiratory infections in developing countries was greater than 0·65 per child per year,18that 12% of these episodes were pneumonia, and 75% were first episodes.",1
"Given that 73% of children had vitamin D deficiency in the study region in 2005,12and that the incidence of pneumonia was ten-times higher in vitamin D deficient children than in children without a deficiency in case-control studies1,2we postulated that there would be at least a 35% reduction in pneumonia incidence in the vitamin D compared with the placebo group.",1
To assess the potential problem of multicollinearity we used Pearsons correlation coefficient or Cramers V (for paired categorical variables).,1
We assessed violation of the proportionality assumption with Schoenfeld residuals.,1
"The difference was not statistically significant, although our study was not powered to detect differences in death rate.",1
"On intention-to-treat analysis, the incidence of the first episode of pneumonia was greater in the vitamin D rather than the placebo group, although this difference was not statistically significant (table 2).",1
"[""The mean serum calcifediol concentration was consistently and significantly higher in the vitamin D group than in the placebo group at 1 week, 4 weeks, and 3 months after administration of the first dose of vitamin D during the winter and at 2 weeks' post administration of dose 3 (spring;figure 3).""]",1
"The ascertainment of study outcomes was robust, and done clinically through masked experienced and retrained paediatricians with Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses clinical definitions of pneumonia applied in other trials18and radiologically through the interpretation of chest radiographs by masked, experienced, and external readers by use of WHO standards.",1
Thus the lack of a protective effect of vitamin D against pneumonia is probably not due to misclassification of outcomes or inadequate supplementation.,1
"Any misclassification of other causes of raised respiratory rate as pneumonia, under-reporting, or over-reporting would be distributed equally between the two groups since the families, doctors, radiographers, radiologists, and data entry staff were masked to the randomisation groupings and the randomisation was successful since the characteristics were balanced between the two groups.",1
"However, a limitation due to the high-risk nature of our population is that the generalisability of our findings to populations with low-to-moderate risk of vitamin deficiency is unknown.",1
"There were fewer deaths than we predicted in both groups, possibly due to the intense health surveillance possible during our study.",1
"Genotyping, which was not practical in our study setting, might have aided the interpretation of our findings, as shown in a vitamin D supplementation trial for tuberculosis.20\nWe accounted for nutritional factors through a diet questionnaire, weight at recruitment, and growth comparison at the end of our study—any nutritional deficiencies would have been equally balanced between the two groups.",1
"As with other studies, dietary calcium deficiency might have led to so-called wastage of body stores of vitamin D in both groups, affecting the maintenance of even higher vitamin D levels in the intervention group.",1
"Nevertheless, there was a higher (adequate level) mean serum concentration of calcifediol at the end of first supplementation period in the intervention group compared with the lower (not adequate) mean concentrations in the placebo group (data not shown).",1
"Furthermore, adult fracture-outcome supplementation studies21show no benefit from adding calcium.",1
A further limitation of our study is that it was not feasible to undertake biochemical assessment of the supplements or assess serum concentrations in all participants after each and between supplementation.,1
Our sample testing suggest that the vitamin D group maintained above mean adequate vitamin D concetrations verses consistently low concentrations in the placebo group.,1
It can be argued that a steady-state adequate vitamin D concentration was not reached in some children because of fluctuations in serum concentrations due to our study regimen.,1
"Although this is probably true, a sufficient serum concentrations for the immunological effects of vitamin D is unknown and could be higher or lower than that of the skeletal system accepted concentrations.6The need for a steady state is currently highly speculative and relates to vitamin D2supplementation for negative cancer22and bone outcomes.23\nOur findings are at odds with smaller case-control hospital studies that show an enhanced rate of vitamin D deficiency or rickets in children with pneumonia and the increasing evidence suggesting that calcitriol, the biologically active metabolite of vitamin D, has an important role in the human immune system.4A systematic review of the role of vitamin D supplementation in infectious diseases had mixed findings, concluding that more rigorously designed clinical trials are needed (panel).25No studies report the effect of vitamin D on radiologically confirmed pneumonias.",1
"Other trials assessing infections of the upper respiratory tract also had mixed findings: one trial in post-menopausal women26identified reduced self-reported episodes of infection of the upper respiratory tract, specifically in winter, whereas two others in elderly24and general adults27did not identify a difference between the groups with regards to self-reported episodes.",1
"One trial in schoolchildren28(measuring influenza A antigen from swabs) found a statistically significant reduced incidence in the intervention group (RR 0·58, 95% CI 0·34–0·99).",1
The benefits of supplementation for tuberculosis are similarly unclear.,1
"One paediatric trial showed 16% higher rates of tuberculosis symptom resolution,29an adult trial showed 23% greater sputum conversion rate at 6 months,30another trial showed 20% greater restriction of BCG-lux growth in blood,31another trial found accelerated sputum conversion only in a certain genotype of the sample,20whereas yet another found no significant difference in sputum conversion32in the intervention compared with the placebo group.",1
"Vitamin D is linked with other non-bone health outcomes, but the few completed and adequately powered trials assessing the effect of supplementation have mixed findings in improving outcomes—ie, cancers, vascular disease, and diabetes.",1
"As in our studies, these inconsistent findings point to the existence of complicated pathways for the function of vitamin D in disease processes, or simply that the correct effective dose of vitamin D supplementation needs to be better defined.",1
"The optimum concentrations of vitamin D for adults and children6are based on non-immunological and, mostly, bone outcomes.",1
"An associated issue is that, after the start of our trial, speculations arose that high fluctuations of natural or supplemented vitamin D intake might be linked to negative outcomes.",1
"These speculations relate two studies in which supplementation of a single large dose (300\u200800033or 500\u200800023IU) of vitamin D for reducing fractures in elderly women led to an increase in fractures, plus similar discrepancies in prostate cancer research with vitamin D.22Our findings and particularly the slightly higher repeat episodes of pneumonia in the vitamin D group could be due to such fluctuations if the hypothesis is true.",1
"If so, then in terms of policy and guidelines, it is hard to know what regimen to recommend for future trials, given that clinical practice and evidence suggests that daily or weekly supplementations though ideal are not complied with13,14and are impractical for families, especially in developing countries, and food fortification at the population level will not be an option during exclusive breastfeeding periods (aged <6 months), nor is it likely to be adequate in highly deficient populations.",1
"Alternately, it might be that immunological effectiveness of supplementation is highly dependent upon other factors as yet unidentified, or other prevalent factors in this high-risk population (for example, other malnutrition factors and that 5·5% of the children in our study had a Z score of weight for age below −3).",1
"Further questions arise with respect to the previous treatment trial in the same region of Kabul, which showed that a single high-dose supplementation with 100\u2008000 IU vitamin D3given orally to young children, along with antibiotic treatment at the time of diagnosis, reduced repeat episodes of pneumonia in the subsequent 3 months.3The inconsistent results could be related to the evidence that stimulation of Toll-like receptors on macrophages and monocytes by bacterial antigens is important in up-regulation of CYP27B1 and the vitamin D receptor,5which are crucial in production of cathelicidins in vitamin-D-depleted individuals.",1
"In other words, this system might not be effective unless there is existing infection with pathogens when vitamin D supplementation is given.",1
"Finally, any possible reduction in the incidence of pneumonia in our trial might be restricted to only certain genotypes as recorded in a single tt genotype after the start of our trial in a study of tuberculosis.20Both the pneumonia treatment and the population supplementation trials need to be repeated in other settings for confirmation, and frequent determination of serum calcifediol concentrations might guide the interpretation of the findings.",1
"As with the trials in the older children, giving higher doses of vitamin D,25,34we too did not record any adverse effects associated with vitamin D supplementation.",1
"However, the number of children and the length of follow-up involved in these studies could only detect common and early adverse effects.",1
"Although vitamin D overload is a theoretical possibility, 100\u2008000 IU of vitamin D3has been shown to provide the best protection against vitamin D deficiency without overload or side-effects in high-risk infants aged 0–9 months with normal baseline ranges of vitamin D.16Furthermore, single intramuscular injection of three times this dose (300\u2008000 IU) was safe in treating nutritional rickets in 6–30-month-old children residing in lower socioeconomic regions of sunny Istanbul.35Higher than recommended doses of daily supplementation of vitamin D (500–1000 IU per day, adding up to 120\u2008000 IU over 3 months) plus additional milk fortified with vitamin D, has been shown not to induce an overload,13including in infants starting with normal ranges of vitamin D, even when supplementation continued during the summer (in France) and when mothers had antenatal vitamin D supplementation.36It is important to note that in our study, where community supplementation was in a population with known high rates of vitamin D deficiency, 1% of children tested had a calcifediol concentration greater than 375 nmol/L—thought undesirably high.6Although these did not produce any clinical signs and symptoms, these measurements raise a need for caution with doses for population supplementation.",1
The speculative negative role of fluctuations is vitamin D needs to be considered with caution until further evidence is available.,1
We have shown that a quarterly 100\u2008000 IU supplementation of vitamin D3did not reduce the incidence of pneumonias in children living in regions with high vitamin D deficiency.,1
"In populations with similar characteristics, quarterly population level supplementation of vitamin D to infants and young children is not a policy option for reducing the burden of pneumonia in children.",1
Herb use among low income women at an urban tertiary care center and their communications with prenatal care providers\n\nPurpose\nLittle is known about the use of herbs in low income underserved mothers and patterns of communication about herb use to prenatal providers.,1
"We sought to examine these issues among women delivering at Boston Medical Center (BMC), an urban medical center serving many of the low income and underserved populations of Boston, Massachusetts.",1
"Methods\nWe interviewed women from the inpatient post-natal unit at BMC about what herbs they used during pregnancy, socioeconomic factors, changes to diet, and use of prenatal vitamins.",1
"We asked women if they discussed the use of herbs with their prenatal care provider, and how satisfied they were with these discussions; we asked the same questions about prenatal vitamin use for comparison.",1
We did not find any medical record documentation of a discussion about herb use.,1
"Conclusion\nIn this study 39% of women reported using herbs during pregnancy, a higher frequency than reported in other studies.",1
"It is important that providers be given the tools to empower them to discuss herbal medicine use with patients, and are encouraged to do so.",1
110\u2003Is Pet Ownership Associated with Higher Vitamin D?,1
"Abstract\n\nBackground\nPet keeping has been linked with decreased risk of allergic sensitization, which has been associated with the Hygiene Hypothesis; and more recently, by ourselves and others, to particular home microbiome patterns.",1
"Another factor possibly associated with pet ownership is increased Vitamin D among family members as pet keeping may be correlated with lifestyles involving increased outdoor exposure, such as dog walking.",1
Prenatal vitamin D inadequacy has been hypothesized as a risk factor for pediatric atopy and asthma.,1
"Methods\nTo investigate potential relationships between household pet exposure and cord blood vitamin D concentrations, we analyzed information from a large, geographically-based, general risk birth cohort.",1
"Because of notable differences in vitamin D concentrations between African Americans and Whites, analyses were stratified by race.",1
"For Whites, but not African Americans, having no pet compared to 1 or >1 pet during pregnancy was associated with lower cord blood vitamin D concentrations (37.7, 45.2, 47.0 nmol/L, respectively, P = 0.001).",1
"Considering type of pet, the relationship for no pet compared to 1 or >1 dog (37.7, 46.1, 49.9 nmol/L, respectively, P = 0.001) was similar to that for no pet versus 1 or >1 cat (37.7, 43.0, 46.5 nmol/L, respectively, P = 0.065).",1
"Conclusions\nIn a large ethnically diverse cohort of newborns, the presence of a pet in the home during the prenatal time period was associated with higher cord blood vitamin D, but only among Whites.",1
This racial difference may reflect an impact on pet owner behavior resulting in increased outdoor exposure that is limited to lighter skinned individuals.,1
"[""However, as the effect doesn't vary by cats versus dogs, differences by race in factors correlated with pet ownership or variations in pet keeping styles may be more important.""]",1
Vitamin D should be considered in studies of pets and atopic conditions.,1
Acute Type A Aortic Dissection in a 36-Week Pregnant Patient\n\nAbstract\nAortic dissection is a relatively rare yet often fatal condition.,1
Early recognition and treatment are crucial for survival.,1
"A review of the literature revealed a paucity of published cases describing the successful, emergent repair of acute type A aortic dissections in third- trimester gravid patients.",1
Introduction\nAortic dissection is a rare complication of pregnancy with significant morbidity and mortality for both the mother and infant.,1
"In the general population, aortic dissection has an estimated incidence of 2.9 per 100,000 person years [1].",1
Acute aortic dissection during the third trimester of pregnancy has been attributed to hemodynamic alterations that occur in late pregnancy.,1
"A high index of suspicion by the emergency physician in addition to successful coordination of care between the emergency physician, obstetrician, and cardiothoracic/vascular surgeon is necessary for a successful outcome.",1
We obtained a CT angiography of the chest due to our high index of suspicion for an acute aortic dissection.,1
Discussion\nAortic dissection is a rare complication of pregnancy with significant morbidity and mortality for both the mother and infant.,1
"A recent 2011 population-based study of acute type A aortic dissection in pregnancy revealed an overall incidence of 0.4 cases per 100,000 person-years and a prehospital mortality rate of 53% [2].",1
A longitudinal study over a period of 27 years discovered that aortic dissection was the initial clinical diagnosis in only 15% of patients presenting with an aortic dissection [1].,1
"While there are no firmly established practice guidelines, it has been suggested that before 28 weeks of gestation, aortic repair should proceed without cesarean section and after 32 weeks gestation, emergency cesarean section precede aortic repair [6].",1
"Between 28 and 32 weeks, the risks and benefits of early delivery should be considered.",1
"Although relatively rare, clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection in any pregnant female who presents with acute onset chest pain.",1
"Early recognition by the emergency physician in addition to successful coordination of care between the emergency physician, obstetrician, and cardiothoracic/vascular surgeon is necessary for a successful outcome.",1
"Gestational Diabetes Insipidus Associated with HELLP Syndrome: A Case Report\n\nAbstract\nGestational diabetes insipidus is a rare, but well recognized, complication of pregnancy.",1
It is related to excess vasopressinase enzyme activity which is metabolized in the liver.,1
"A high index of suspicion of gestational diabetes insipidus is required in a correct clinical setting especially in the presence of other risk factors such as preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, and twin pregnancies.",1
The newborn in this case also had hypernatremia thereby raising possibilities of vasopressinase crossing the placenta.,1
"Introduction\nGestational diabetes insipidus is a rare complication of pregnancy, and it is related to excess vasopressinase activity.",1
"Measurement of the vasopressinase serum concentrations is not available commercially, and the diagnosis is usually established based on the clinical presentation and the appropriate laboratory studies.",1
We are describing a unique case of gestational diabetes insipidus in a patient with HELLP syndrome.,1
"Discussion\nGestational diabetes insipidus is a rare complication of pregnancy that occurs in 4 out of 100,000 pregnancies as discussed by Durr [1].",1
"Symptoms usually develop over a few days and include polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue, nausea, weight loss, and decreased skin turgor.",1
Its pathophysiology is thought to result from increased degradation of arginine vasopressin (AVP) by a placental enzyme called vasopressinase.,1
The primary known action of vasopressinase is in vivo as well as in vitro degradation of vasopressin by removing amino acids from the N-terminus.,1
"Since the exogenous desmopressin is deaminated at the N-terminus, it can escape the degrading effect of the vasopressinase and is considered the treatment of choice in patients with gestational diabetes insipidus as demonstrated by Schrier [4].",1
"Vasopressinase is metabolized in the liver, which may explain higher concentrations of the enzyme in patients with fatty liver, hepatitis and preeclampsia as discussed by Barbey et al.",1
HELLP syndrome is considered a spectrum of preeclampsia.,1
"The pathophysiology is not well understood but has been hypothesized to result from excessive stimulation of V1 receptors by vasopressinase-altered AVP leading to platelet aggregation, vasospasm, endothelial constriction, and brain stimulation as discussed by Krege and Katz [6].",1
"On the other hand, liver dysfunction in patients with HELLP syndrome decreases the degradation of the vasopressinase as described by Ellidokuz et al.",1
"[""Therefore, it is possible that vasopressinase could have crossed the placenta thereby causing infant's hypernatremia and subsequently could have benefited from dDAVP.""]",1
"In light of the above case, we recommend maintaining a high index of suspicion of gestational diabetes insipidus in patients who present with typical symptoms and signs especially in the presence of other risk factors such as preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, and twin pregnancies.",1
"In addition, treating the infant with DDAVP besides intravenous fluids may also be beneficial.",1
"Translation of a gestational diabetes nutrition model of care into practice: results from an implementation project\n\nBackground\nReduced need for insulin therapy in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) has been documented in a study validating American Nutrition Practice Guidelines, which recommend at least 3 dietitian visits.",1
No Australian GDM Nutrition Practice Guidelines exist and systematic delivery of dietetic care to women with GDM does not occur in Australia.,1
This paper evaluates a theory-informed implementation plan to translate a dietetic model of care based on the American guidelines in an Australian maternity hospital.,1
Results\nBoth phases only ran for 7 months; integration required 4 months.,1
"Pre-intervention, only one of the 91 women with GDM seen received ≥ 1 dietetic follow-up appointment.",1
"However, due to heavy clinical demand, only 31.5 % of the 162 women seen after the change in practice received best-practice individual dietitian review at their first visit.",1
Clinically-relevant trends were seen in changes in medication requirements; the percentage of women requiring pharmacologic treatment decreased from 31.1% to 26.9%.,1
"Only a small change in glycemic index of women’s diet occurred after seeing a dietitian, pre- to post- implementation (-2.0 ± 4.4 vs. -3.0 ± 5.0).",1
Service limitations impaired the delivery of optimal care.,1
Partial adherence to the model of care may have attenuated changes in medication requirements and dietary patterns.,1
Full adherence may have resulted in even greater changes.,1
"Anaphylaxis associated with folic acid: domestic case review\n\nBackground\nSynthetic folic acid has been shown to cause serious, potentially life-threatening IgE mediated anaphylaxis [1-3].",1
Results\nAll 15 cases of anaphylaxis involved multi ingredient products with NHP doses (up to and including 1 mg).,1
"One case of anaphylaxis and 3 cases of serious allergic reaction involved women taking prenatal supplements, two of which reported spontaneous abortion.",1
There was insufficient case information available to assess any causal association between the allergic reaction and the fetal loss.,1
"Three medically important cases involved pharmaceutical doses of folic acid (5 mg), one of which was a pediatric case involving a multi ingredient intravenous total parental nutrition product (Multi-12/K1 pediatric) containing folic acid.",1
Conclusions\nFolic acid allergy appears to be rare and would not be expected to be well known among health providers or consumers.,1
Increasing awareness amongst health providers regarding folic acid allergy may improve the identification and counselling of patients with this allergy.,1
Should Men Take Prenatal Vitamins?,1
Short Communication\nCongenital abnormalities are the leading cause of infant mortalities in the United States (25%) and across the world [1].,1
"Potentially the most significant nutritional intervention has been the prenatal supplementation of folate, which has been shown to reduce the incidence of neural tube defects [3], limb malformations, urogenital abnormalities, cardiovascular malformations [4], and cleft lip or palate [5].",1
The influence of paternal diet on congenital abnormalities and fertility is still being elucidated.,1
A recent mouse study by Lambrot et al.,1
furthered our understanding of the effects of paternal folate deficiency [6].,1
Folate deficiency was associated with an increase in DNA damage in spermatocytes.,1
"However, there was no difference in sperm tail DNA fragmentation, tail length, or motility (p>0.05).",1
"Another study investigating the effect of a paternal folate-deficient diet in mice found a relationship with decreased placental weight, placental folate and an increased expression of the folate transporter folate receptor [7].",1
"A link has been found between paternal dioxin exposure, a component of the herbicide Agent Orange used in the Vietnam War, and spermatazoidfolate deficiency resulting in an increased rate of spina bifida [8].",1
"Although the precise mechanism is unclear, it is thought that epigenetic modifications (study of heritable changes in gene activity that are not caused by changes in the DNA sequence) play a role in both neural tube defects and decreased fertility of men with a folate deficiency [8].",1
"However, a prospective study of 42 couples, who had paternal methotrxate exposure at the time of conception, did not identify any congenital abnormalities [9].",1
The role of paternal nutrition on epigenetically linked heritable diseases such as cardiovascular and obesity have been suggested in epidemiological studies [10].,1
Human studies examining the role of paternal micronutrient supplementation are scant.,1
"investigated the role of supplemental folate, zinc and antioxidants (vitamins C, E, and β-carotene) on spermatocyte aneuploidy.",1
It is clear that a deficiency of paternal micronutrients could affect the development of offspring through epigenetic regulation.,1
"However, it is unclear at this time whether or not supplementation of vitamins such as folate can reduce congenital anomalies in men with an otherwise well-balanced diet.",1
A prospective randomized control trial is necessary to adequately determine the role for male prenatal vitamins.,1
"Due to the lack of conclusive evidence, we cannot recommend the ubiquitous use of prenatal vitamins, in particular folate, in men attempting to plan a pregnancy with their female partner at this time.",1
Fish Intake during Pregnancy and Foetal Neurodevelopment—A Systematic Review of the Evidence\n\nAbstract\nFish is a source of several nutrients that are important for healthy foetal development.,1
"Guidelines from Australia, Europe and the USA encourage fish consumption during pregnancy.",1
"The potential for contamination by heavy metals, as well as risk of listeriosis requires careful consideration of the shaping of dietary messages related to fish intake during pregnancy.",1
"This review critically evaluates literature on fish intake in pregnant women, with a focus on the association between neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring and maternal fish intake during pregnancy.",1
"Due to heterogeneity in methodology and measured outcomes, a qualitative comparison of study findings was conducted.",1
This review indicates that the benefits of diets providing moderate amounts of fish during pregnancy outweigh potential detrimental effects in regards to offspring neurodevelopment.,1
It is important that the type of fish consumed is low in mercury.,1
"Introduction\nFish is a source of several nutrients that are important during pregnancy for healthy foetal development including iodine, long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n- 3PUFAs), and vitamins A, D and B12 [1].",1
"Guidelines from Australia [2], Europe [3] and the USA [4] encourage the consumption of fish during pregnancy.",1
"Recent studies indicate that pregnant women lack sufficient knowledge regarding the importance of iodine and LC n -3 PUFAs [5,6], nutrients that are present in fish and seafood.",1
"In addition, it appears Australian women are falling short of LC n- 3PUFA intake recommendations during pregnancy [6,7].",1
"On average, Australian women are consuming 33 g of fish per day and pregnant women an average of 28 g of fish per day, below Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) recommended intakes [8].",1
"As well as being a source of essential nutrients, fish are also a potential source of contaminants including mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins [9].",1
"Guidelines emphasising the health risks of methyl-mercury, with little mention of important nutrients found in fish, may be contributing to women consuming less than the recommended fish servings during pregnancy [10].",1
Thus the risks and benefits resulting from fish consumption need to be considered and scientific evidence should direct advice given to pregnant women to help them make the safest choice.,1
"There are many documented health benefits from fish consumption with regard to foetal health, including improved neurodevelopment, increased birth weight and a reduced risk of spontaneous abortion [11,12].",1
"This review focuses on neurodevelopmental outcomes for the foetus as much of the published research into fish consumption during pregnancy has focused on methyl-mercury, LC n -3PUFAs and iodine, all known to impact foetal neurodevelopment [13,14].",1
The aim of this review was to critically appraise literature investigating fish intake in pregnant women to assess the hypothesis that fish consumption during pregnancy positively influences foetal neurodevelopment.,1
This review concludes with a discussion highlighting some of the methodological issues in researching associations between diet and infant neurodevelopment.,1
The search strategy did not yield any randomised controlled trials of fish intake in pregnant women and associated foetal neurodevelopmental outcomes.,1
"When mercury confounder was adjusted for, this association became significant: 4.0 (1.3 to 6.7).Mothers consuming greater than 2 fish serves per week had infants with the greatest VRM scores.Seafood intake during pregnancy was associated with a significant reduction in percentage of children with suboptimal IQ and behaviour test scores in 9 of 23 outcomes.Non-seafood consumers during pregnancy had children who scored lower on tests of verbal IQ at 8 years: OR (CI) for no seafood = 1.48 (1.16–1.90); some seafood 1.09 (0.92–1.20) compared with >340 g per week [overall trend: p = 0.004].Oily fish consumption more than once per week versus no oily fish reduced the risk of hyperactivity.No association with fish consumption in early pregnancy and full scale IQ, however, total fish intake in late pregnancy of 1 to 2 serves per week was associated with having a child with higher IQ at age 9 years.Higher intakes (3 or more serves per week) did not show a statistically significant improvement.Regression coefficients (95% CI) for fish consumption and full scale IQ: less than once per week vs. no fish = 7.76 (0.38 to 15.1), once or twice per week vs. no fish = 6.91 (0.19 to 13.6).Verbal IQ & fish consumption: Increase of 7.32 (0.26 to 14.4) with fish consumption once or twice per week.",1
"Trained examiners conducted Neurodevelopmental testing of child was completed via a Neonatal Behavioural Assessment 3 days post birth (28 behavioural & 18 reflex items).Comparator and ComparisonFish intake in quintilesWeekly servingsCategories: no fish (0 g), 1–2 servings (1–340 g per week), or 3 or more servings per week (over 340 g).Fish consumption:No fish serves, less than or equal to 2 servings per week, greater than 2 servings per week.Maternal fish intake of more than 2–3 times per week compared to up to once per week.No mention of intake in grams.Maternal seafood intake in grams (average intake = 300–360 g per week).OutcomeHighest 3 quintiles of fish intake resulted in improved motor, social/cognitive and total development scores at 18 months:OR (95%CI) = 1.28 (1.20, 1.38) for highest versus lowest quintile.This association was less obvious at 6 months (only the highest quintile showed significant improvement).Offspring of women who ate fish more than twice a week scored significantly higher on WRAVMA drawing and total scores compared with no serves.OR (95%CI) for WRAVMA drawing = 6.0 (1.8, 10.2) for more than two serves per week compared with no serves.WRAVMA total score = 5.3 (0.9, 9.6) for more than two serves per week compared to no serves.Pregnant women fish consumption greater than 2–3 times per week had children with significantly higher cognition and motor development scores compared to women consuming fish less than once a week.",1
This association was only significant in children breastfed for up to 6 months.Greater than 3 serves per week was not associated with improved outcomes.Seafood intake weakly ( p = 0.1) correlated with motor development.,1
"Other measures of neurodevelopment not significant in either direction.QualityNeutralPositivePositiveNeutral\nStudies were heterogeneous in methodology in regard to the covariates, neurological assessment tools, length of follow up statistical analyses.",1
"In addition, the type and amounts of fish consumed differed across study locations.",1
Due to this heterogeneity a qualitative rather than quantitative approach was deemed appropriate for comparison and presentation of findings.,1
tested children at six months of age using Visual Recognition Memory (VRM) paradigm and found a significant improvement of 2.8 points for each additional serving of fish (85–140 g) consumed by the mother during pregnancy [19].,1
found that the length of breastfeeding influenced whether a significant difference was found in offspring neurodevelopment when comparing high and low fish intakes during pregnancy [24].,1
Authors reported that fish consumption two to three times per week during pregnancy was beneficial for children who were breastfed for less than six months.,1
"However, no statistical improvement was indicated for those children who were breastfed for longer than six months [24].",1
demonstrated no adverse effects on offspring neurodevelopment with maternal fish consumption during pregnancy equal to or greater than once per week.,1
This study reported an improved verbal Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in offspring aged nine years in children born to mothers who consumed up to two servings of fish per week compared with children born to mothers who had not consumed any fish during late pregnancy (32 weeks gestation).,1
This association was not significant for fish consumption in early pregnancy (15 weeks gestation) suggesting that fish consumption may be of more benefit during the third trimester [21].,1
A report from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) found that fish consumption during pregnancy of one to three servings per week was shown to provide a modest but significant improvement in developmental scores of the offspring for language and social activity at fifteen to eighteen months of age [18].,1
A longer follow up of the ALSPAC cohort demonstrated a reduction in the percentage of children with suboptimal IQ at eight years of age amongst mothers with a high seafood intake (greater than 340 g) during pregnancy [20].,1
A smaller ( n = 498) Japanese study did not demonstrate a positive or negative association between maternal fish intake during pregnancy and neurodevelopment as measured by the Neonatal Behavioural Assessment tool in infants at three days of age [25].,1
"Conversely, results from a US cohort study demonstrated a significant improvement in IQ with consumption of more than two maternal servings of fish intake per week as assessed via ‘milestone’ achievement in children aged six months and eighteen months [23].",1
"Results from a large Danish national birth cohort ( n = 25,446) indicated a significant improvement in motor, cognitive and total developmental scores for eighteen month old children who were born to women within the highest three quintiles of fish intake during pregnancy.",1
"At six months, this improvement was only significant for children of women in the highest quintile of fish consumption, suggesting that age of testing may be relevant [22].",1
Seven of the eight reviewed articles showed a beneficial impact on certain measures of offspring neurodevelopment with fish intake ranging from less than one to three or more servings of fish per week.,1
"Thus, the evidence in these cohort studies supports the current recommendations for fish consumption during pregnancy [2,3,4].",1

Discussion\nThis systematic review of observational cohort studies demonstrates an association between consumption of one or more servings of fish per week during pregnancy and better offspring neurodevelopment outcomes.,1
[21] was the only study to report a neutral effect of seafood intake on all neurodevelopmental outcomes.,1
"However, in that study neurodevelopment was assessed when the infant was only three days old.",1
"The seven studies, which demonstrated a benefit in neurodevelopment, had a follow up time ranging from six months to nine years.",1
Thus it is possible that longer follow up may be needed to determine significant associations.,1
This concept is supported by Oken et al.,1
which found an improvement in neurodevelopmental scores at six months in only the highest quintile of fish intake while this improvement was evident in the highest three quintiles at eighteen months [22].,1
"[24] found that seafood consumption that excluded fish intake had a detrimental effect on neurodevelopment, while fish intake alone led to improved outcomes.",1
Thus it is possible that the study of Suzuki et al.,1
[25] may have detected a benefit had fish been considered separately from total seafood.,1
[21] reported differences in outcomes associated with oily fish intake and total fish intake in early compared to late pregnancy.,1
This suggests that the type of fish and timing of consumption during pregnancy may impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes of offspring.,1
"However, this information is limited to a single study, which was conducted in a relatively small sample ( n = 217).",1
More research in this area is required to draw sound conclusions.,1
It is important to note the number methodological limitations in research on diet and infant neurodevelopment that are present in these studies.,1
"This prevents the conclusion of a definitive relationship without further research, preferably clinical randomised controlled trials, and a proper meta-analysis.",1
Measuring dietary intake in cohort studies is problematic due to the difficulty in obtaining detailed information without causing significant subject burden.,1
"No studies reported adjusting results from the FFQ for energy intake, a recommendation made by Freedman et al .",1
"Three studies [19,21,24] reported on the frequency of consumption without specifying the weight of fish servings while the remaining studies made assumptions based on standard serving sizes, as to the quantity of fish consumed at each occasion.",1
This limits the accuracy of a quantifiable conclusion as due to individual variability in the perception of a ‘serving size’.,1
Assessing cognitive development differences in infancy and childhood is fraught with difficulties due to the nature of childhood development and the accurate measurement of such.,1
"Firstly, children develop in ‘spurts’ rather than in a continuous fashion, which means they may slip in and out of the ‘normal’ reference ranges, particularly in the earlier years [27,28].",1
"To combat this, it has been suggested that testing occurs at more than one time point [27] and that testing should extend beyond the first two years, preferable to school aged children in order to detect more subtle differences [28].",1
"Only 4 studies tested at multiple time points [18,21,22,24], four beyond two years [20,21,23,24], and only two looked at children of school age [20,21].",1
"Secondly, there are multiple interrelated factors which impact on neurodevelopment, and not all confounders were accounted for in all analyses.",1
"However, factors including ethnicity, paternal intelligence, the home environment, drug use, dietary patterns, supplement use and maternal responsiveness were not always measured.",1
"[20] included the home environment as a confounder, but not paternal IQ.",1
"Conversely, the two studies by Oken et al.",1
The remaining four studies did not correct for either paternal IQ or home environment.,1
No studies adjusted for maternal responsiveness which has been shown to be related to developmental outcomes independent of sociodemographic factors [28].,1
An intake of fish may reflect a health conscious diet and thus the positive effects may not be directly attributed to the fish but rather to the diet as a whole.,1
considered maternal diet by classifying women as following a “prudent” or “western” dietary pattern [23].,1
"[20] also adjusted for maternal diet, while Mendez et al.",1
Other studies did not effectively account for dietary intake and are thus at risk of bias.,1
"[20] reported that only 1.7% of women consumed fish oil supplements not affecting outcomes, however, this study did not consider supplements other than fish oil.",1
Only Mendez et al.,1
[24] included supplement usage as a confounder.,1
There is no universal standard for which neurodevelopmental tests are most appropriate for use in children of varying ages and at what age meaningful differences in neurocognitive development can be detected [29].,1
"Performance in assessments can be significantly altered if the participant is hungry, tired or fearful of being in a strange place or being tested [27].",1
The accuracy of the tests for the population depends on when the test was standardised and within what population.,1
"In particular the Denver test, utilised in the ALSPAC study [18] has been criticised for its low specificity and potentially outdated ‘norm’ as it was standardised in 1980 [30].",1
"Research on the reliability of parental reports on child development is conflicting [31], Daniels et al.",1
"[22] used developmental testing carried out by the mother and thus results may not be as reliable as those reported by other studies, which used trained professionals.",1
"Due to the risks associated with consuming fish and seafood during pregnancy related to food safety and heavy metal contamination, pregnant women may question the necessity of including these foods in their diets, when nutrition supplements are readily accessible in Western countries [32].",1
A systematic review of randomised control trials examining LC n -3PUFA supplementation during pregnancy found no clear association between supplement use and infant cognitive outcomes [33].,1
"This may be attributable to the synergistic effects of food [34] and associated with fish being a source of other nutrients which are important for infant development such as iodine and vitamin D. Presently, there have been no randomised control trials examining neurocognitive outcomes associated with prenatal multivitamin use and infant neurodevelopment, and these are unlikely to occur given ethical implications of such [35].",1
Recent research has suggested that effects of methyl-mercury on infant brain development may be mediated by LC n -3PUFA [36].,1
"Because it is possible to consume fish and seafood safely during pregnancy, through following recommendations to limit high mercury species, it is prudent to recommend that pregnant women consume these foods, rather than rely on supplementation, in order to maximise infant neurodevelopment outcomes.",1
Conclusions\nThis review assessed the hypothesis that fish intake during pregnancy improves offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes.,1
"A review of the available evidence indicates that intake of fish during pregnancy is associated with positive foetal neurodevelopmental outcomes, as supported by seven of eight articles reviewed, which showed a beneficial impact on foetal neurodevelopment with one or more servings of fish per week compared with no fish intake.",1
Based on the results from these observational studies the current recommendation of two to three servings per week appears appropriate.,1
"Randomised clinical trials have been conducted using fish oil supplementation in pregnancy, but not with fish considered as a whole food.",1
Existing evidence is currently insufficient to inform advice regarding fish intake during pregnancy.,1
"Further well designed studies are required to strengthen the evidence base regarding the type and quantity of maternal fish consumption during pregnancy and associated neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring, while considering the contribution of mercury from fish-containing diets.",1
"In other words, ICDS reflects the country’s obligation to enhance the pre-school education rates and an effective strategy to break the vicious cycle of malnutrition, infection and mortality (3).",1
The rationale to deliver a bunch of services is to mutually enhance the impact of a specific service with the aid of other services in the long-run (2).,1
"As far as the vacancy status is concerned, almost 33.9%, 35%, 7.1%, and 7.2% of CDPOs, Supervisors, Anganwadi workers and Anganwadi helpers posts are still vacant in the country.",1
"Different indicator such as the number of beneficiaries enrolled in Anganwadicentre for supplementary nutrition or for preschool education has been proposed to monitor the implementation of the scheme in different Anganwadi centres of the country (1,5).",1
Findings of a study revealed the positive impact on reducing the levels of anemia in children between 6-60 months in India (6).,1
"In another study conducted in rural pocket of Varanasi to evaluate the impact of ICDS on maternal nutrition and birth weight, it was concluded that undernourished antenatal women are definitely benefitted by late pregnancy nutrition supplement (7).",1
"In the mission to enhance and compound the benefit of services delivered under ICDS, Government of India has developed partnerships with the international agencies like United Nations International Children’ Emergency Fund (for providing technical guidance in developing need-based training plans; assist in organizing scientific workshops; and in impact assessment on early childhood nutrition and development), Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (contribution in the areas of maternal and child health, girl primary education, etc.",1
"As a part of the capacity building efforts, the Ministry of Women & Child Development has recommended policy related and institutional transformations.",1
"The strategy is to develop Anganwadi as a “vibrant early childhood development centre” by giving greater focus on under three years children, strengthening early childhood education, and by ensuring care and counseling of mothers and family.",1
"In addition, the Ministry is planning to improve the supplementary nutrition services; creating Anganwadi based crèches centers; intensify monitoring, and training activities; to develop linkages with different stakeholders such as Pan-chayati Raj Institutions and ministry of rural development (1).",1
"To conclude, the ICDS scheme is a comprehensive approach for delivering an integrated package of services to bring about a significant improvement in the child related health, care, and nutrition practices of the community.",1

"Introduction\nThe fifth Millennium Development Goal (MDG), “Improvement of Maternal Health” [1] has Antenatal Care (ANC) coverage or attendance as a progress indicator.",1
"However, in Cameroon, MMR has risen by 8 %from 680 to 872 deaths per 100 000 in the past 9 years after the initial decrease [3].",1
"Studies on ANC in low income countries have mainly focused on monitoring quantifiable data such as the number of antennal visits during ANC [3,4] and its effects on pregnancy outcome [5].",1
"However, the perspective is changing from one of not just needing any service to one in which quality is a key component in health care provision [6,7].",1
"In Cameroon, there are few reported studies on the quality of ANC services rendered; meanwhile the study of consumer perceptions in relation to behavioral outcomes has been on the rise in other countries [8].",1
"[""This study is therefore designed to investigate pregnant women's perception of quality of ANC services rendered in health facilities within the Buea Health District area.""]",1

"These recommendations were pooled into themes of which the most prevalent theme concerned health centre amenities (20.2%) such as good toilet facilities, cleanliness, reduced congestion and preferential care towards the women in aspects such as rapid delivery of laboratory results.",1
The respondents also wished that the health talks (16.3%) should be more regular and that primigravida should be encouraged to come regularly.,1
"Women of high educational level were the most interested in the health talk recommendation (76% of all recommendations were made by this class of respondents), arguing that the “lectures” should be more detailed than what they were at the moment.",1
Discussion\nThe study aimed at exploring the perceptions of pregnant women attending antenatal clinic in the public health centres in the Buea Health District regarding antenatal care in terms of their knowledge and satisfaction with service delivery.,1
"[""It also sought to establish reasons that determined these women's choice of ANC site as well as explore the geographic distribution of the women with respect to their residence and their attending health centre.""]",1
Only 6% of women started visits in the first trimester while 14.5% began in the third trimester.,1
"This observation is similar to studies carried out in Kenya [13] and South Africa [14] where women started clinic late because of perceived lack of benefit, limited facility access, uncertainty about pregnancy and “laziness” to go for many visits.",1
Late antenatal visits attendance is detrimental because it prevents the clients from obtaining the maximum benefits from the antenatal service [14–16].,1
"With respect to the reasons that influenced the respondents’ choice of health centre, the main factor affecting the choice of ANC site was geographical accessibility.",1
This observation is similar to that seen in Uganda [17] and Zimbabwe [18] where it was also shown that the quality of care provided was contributory.,1
This illustrates the importance of previous contact with a facility to determine further use.,1
"Here, the perception of the past users is the only driving tool to refer.",1
The husband has been shown to play a significant role in determining the choice of ANC site by the woman in a Nigerian [19] and Ugandan study [20] where they accounted for 43% and 32% of all recommendations respectively.,1
"Evaluation of the reasons why 55.2% of respondents changed their ANC site, revealed that the change of residence, closeness to the health facility and the quality of care offered at the previous site were the predominant reasons.",1
"[""This further emphasizes the importance of distance as a dominant factor in determining women's choice of site [19].""]",1
"Hence efforts should be geared towards improving on health centre variables (cleanliness, comfort in sitting area and quality of care amongst others) to improve on their utilization by the women who live nearby especially for those health centres which are relatively new and by so doing increasing their attendance rate.",1
"[""Pregnant women's knowledge about the timing, goals of ANC visits, and the number of antenatal visits was very high among the study participants contrary to what was shown in studies carried out in Tanzania [14] and South Africa [15].""]",1
"Concerning the number of ANC visits, the health centres follow the Western model of clinic visits with an average of 10 to 12 visits.",1
"However, attitudes are changing towards the “minimum of 4 visits” recommended by the WHO after the work of Nigenda et al [21] and Langer et al.",1
"If this approach is vulgarized, it might increase the uptake of ANC services and improve on the quality of health care.",1
The health care education topics were similar among the studies reviewed though there were some disparities in the frequency.,1
"[""45.2% of respondents received information on the detection or management of pregnancy danger signs, an observation similar to the 42% in Pembe's study in Tanzania [23].""]",1
"In marked contrast, the Kenyan study by Ouma and collaborators [24] and that in Nigeria by Dairo and Owoyokun [25] found that only 10.4% and up to 89.6% of pregnant women were informed of pregnancy danger signs respectively.",1
This accounts for the low rate of these health talks in this study as opposed to other studies [26].,1
Respondents rated the services provided at the health centres generally as satisfactory.,1
"The services offered were acceptable in contrast with observations from other studies in Sub-Saharan countries such as in Uganda by Cham et al [27] and that by van Eijket al [4] in Kenya where for example, urine and serological tests are not routinely done.",1
"With regards to waiting time at the clinic, the women recognized that most of the time wasting was due to late coming of their fellow pregnant women.",1
"However, dissatisfaction abounded with respect to this aspect, especially for women of higher educational levels.",1
The women with high level of education and women attending for their first pregnancies were not satisfied with the competence of the staff.,1
Most of them recommended an improvement in the nurses’ skills.,1
"However, women attending for their subsequent pregnancies and those at their third or more visits were more tolerant of the services provided at the health centres.",1
This is probably because their contact with the health system had tailored their expectations and they expressed satisfaction with the existing services.,1
"Women attending ANC for their subsequent pregnancies probably had a notion of what health topics were discussed during clinic sessions and so their objectives at ANC were not only aimed at acquiring knowledge about diet, danger signs and other topics but also in the state of their babies.",1
Primigravida on the contrary expected vital information from the health talks to help them cope well with their pregnancy and labor [29].,1
"However, an Australian study showed that both women and providers thought the time for antenatal classes was too small to incorporate all they had to learn with some women complaining of having received too much information [29].",1
"These results are similar to other studies of patient satisfaction; (96.5%) in Ibadan, Nigeria [7] and 86.4% in Ogun State, Nigeria [25].",1
"However, it has been said that the views of pregnant women concerning their care is generally positive as they tend to be uncritical of healthcare, accepting whatever care they receive as appropriate [29].",1
"[""Thus using patient views to evaluate health care has been criticized [30], regarding their responses as a mixture of the healthcare performance measurement and the respondent's reflection.""]",1
"Nevertheless, patient views provide an insight to the care provided and the system as a whole.",1
The influence of the educational level of respondents is predominant here as it is noticed that those at a high educational level are more likely to be critical about care received and defer a positive satisfaction.,1
"This issue was also revealed in Fawole and colleagues’ study [7] where they hypothesized that as the level of education in the community steadily increases, pregnant women may become more and more critical of health care.",1
Hence there is a need to mobilize efforts for a better quality assessment in our health care provision with the aim of improving quality in terms of provision of health care services.,1
Improvement must be made to attain a desired change and amelioration in our health care delivery package.,1
"The users’ opinion has been sought here and it is noticed that they recommend ameliorations in the interpersonal interaction with staff in terms of more comprehensive health talks and improvement in nursing skills, better infrastructures(like good toilet facilities and comfortable sitting areas) and tolerable waiting times.",1
A step in this direction will go a long way to consolidate the improvement in health care delivery sought by Cameroon in the framework of the MDGs.,1
Conclusion\nAbout one third of pregnant women in our study population attended an ANC site different from their local catchment area despite the availability of ANC in their residential area.,1
"[""High educational level and primiparity are negatively associated with pregnant women's satisfaction of care received at ANC.""]",1
"Taken together, policy makers should implement changes in the health care delivery system taking into account the users’ opinion, more so in the light of increasing female education in Cameroon.",1
"Pre-pregnancy body mass index, weight gain and energy intake in pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus\n\nBackground\nStudies have shown that maternal obesity is associated with increased risk of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM).",1
Excessive gestational weight gain is also associated with risk of GDM.,1
"Moreover, dietary factors, before and during pregnancy, have been linked to increased risk for GDM.",1
"Nutritional intervention is important for the control of GDM, as it provides benefits to mother and fetal health.",1
"However, the literature remains inconclusive on the role of dietary factors in the development of this disease.",1

Further studies are needed to better elucidate the role of dietary factors and specific nutrients in the risk for this disease.,1

"Circulating Cathelicidin Concentrations in a Cohort of Healthy Children: Influence of Age, Body Composition, Gender and Vitamin D Status\n\nAbstract\nCathelicidin is an antimicrobial peptide whose circulating levels are related to vitamin D status in adults.",1
"This study sought to determine if circulating cathelicidin concentrations in healthy children are related to the age of the child, body composition and vitamin D status at birth and at the time of the study visit.",1
"The cohort’s median cathelicidin concentration was 28.1 ng/mL (range: 5.6–3368.6) and did not correlate with 25(OH)D, but was positively correlated with advancing age (ρ = 0.236 & p = 0.005, respectively).",1
"Increased age and male gender were correlated with increased cathelicidin when controlling for race/ethnicity, percent fat, and child’s current 25(OH)D concentration (p = 0.028 & p = 0.047, respectively).",1
"This study demonstrated that as children age, the concentration of cathelicidin increases.",1
"Furthermore, male gender was significantly associated with increased cathelicidin concentrations.",1
The lack of association between vitamin D status and cathelicidin in this study may be due to the narrow range in observed 25(OH)D values and warrants additional studies for further observation.,1
"Previous studies have focused on cathelicidin and vitamin D concentrations in patient populations affected by various illnesses or diseases [6], such as tuberculosis [7], pneumonia [8], sepsis [9], HIV [10–12], and end-stage renal disease hemodialysis [13], as well as healthy adult populations [14–19].",1
"Additionally, while one study examined the levels of maternal and neonatal vitamin D and cathelicidin concentrations in healthy children at delivery, there is a lack of research to determine correlations between vitamin D status and cathelicidin among healthy children over time [20], as well as which factors such as age of the child, gender, and body composition may independently impact cathelicidin concentrations.",1
"To address this gap in the literature, the aim of this follow-up study was to determine if maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy and/or a child’s current vitamin D status affect the circulating concentration of cathelicidin in healthy children years after delivery.",1
A second aim was to determine if the concentration of cathelicidin and vitamin D correlate with the number of infections a child experiences during childhood and as a function of age.,1
It was hypothesized that (1) total current circulating 25(OH)D would be positively correlated with cathelicidin in children; (2) children with higher plasma cathelicidin concentrations would have had fewer infections than children with lower cathelicidin concentrations; and (3) cathelicidin concentration would increase with advancing age.,1
A post-hoc analysis was conducted to determine if BMI and percent fat had an effect on cathelicidin concentration.,1
"Four multivariable regressions were performed to assess whether any significant associations existed between the natural logarithm of each subject’s cathelicidin concentration and each of the following vitamin D measurements: (1) child’s current 25(OH)D at time of follow-up, (2) child’s 25(OH)D at birth, (3) maternal 25(OH)D throughout pregnancy (Visits 3 to 7 as area under the curve), and (4) maternal 25(OH)D one month before delivery; all analyses controlled for race/ethnicity, age, gender, and percent fat.",1
The size of this study’s cohort provided us with 80% power to detect correlations as small as 0.24.,1

"White mothers were found to have a significantly higher 25(OH)D concentration (45.8 ng/mL; 114.5 nmol/L) than both Black (34.8 ng/mL; 87.0 nmol/L) and Hispanic mothers (38.0 ng/mL; 95.0 nmol/L) throughout pregnancy (p≤0.0001 and ≤0.0001, respectively).",1
Black and Hispanic mothers were found to have a statistically significant difference in 25(OH)D concentrations throughout pregnancy as well (p≤0.0001).,1
A similar pattern was demonstrated in children’s 25(OH)D at the time of follow-up visit.,1
"White children had a mean 25(OH)D concentration of 35.1 ng/mL (87.8 nmol/L) at the follow-up visit, which was also found to be significantly higher than both Black and Hispanic children with mean 25(OH)D concentrations of 22.5 ng/mL (56.3 nmol/L) and 25.4 ng/mL (63.5 nmol/L), respectively (p≤0.0001 and ≤0.0001, respectively).",1
"Despite differences in vitamin D status, there were no significant associations between cathelicidin, race/ethnicity and vitamin D status (see Table 2 ).",1
"In addition, there were no significant correlations found between concentration of cathelicidin and the child’s 25(OH)D concentration at birth, maternal 25(OH)D within one month of delivery, or maternal 25(OH)D area under the curve from pregnancy visits 3–7.",1
"Within the entire cohort, age of the child and cathelicidin concentration demonstrated a positive correlation (ρ = 0.236, p = 0.005).",1
"When the data were stratified by gender in post-hoc analyses, only the male population continued to demonstrate this correlation (ρ = 0.292, p = 0.014), while females did not (ρ = 0.103, p = 0.425).",1
"Although not statistically significant, a slightly negative trend of increased cathelicidin correlated with a decreased frequency of diagnosed infections within the last year (ρ = -0.147, p = 0.092).10.1371/journal.pone.0152711.g001\n\nCaption (FIG): FIG 1\nCathelicidin Concentration by Age.",1
"There was a significant positive correlation between age and cathelicidin concentration (ρ = 0.236, p = 0.005); ρ value represents Spearman correlation.",1
"In the group of children with a total circulating 25(OH)D concentration ≥20 ng /mL, cathelicidin concentration was significantly positively associated with age (ρ = 0.373, p = 0.0002).",1
"Within this same group, cathelicidin concentration was negatively associated with the number of documented infections a child experienced in the last year (ρ = -0.205, p = 0.047).",1
"In each of the models, however, the child’s age at their first follow-up visit was significantly and independently positively correlated with cathelicidin.",1
"Thus, Model 1 indicates that every 1-year increase in a child’s age is associated with a 0.145 unit increase in their log cathelicidin concentration, equivalent to a e0.145= 1.2-fold increase from 1 year to the next.",1
"In Models 1 and 4), higher cathelicidin concentrations were significantly associated with male gender (beta = 0.318, p = 0.047), indicating that after adjusting for the other variables in the model, males’ cathelicidin levels were 1.4 times higher than females’.",1

"A positive correlation between age and cathelicidin and between gender and cathelicidin were noted, with higher concentrations in male children.",1
"Regardless of vitamin D status, there was no statistically significant difference in cathelicidin concentrations between subjects, consistent with the findings of other recent studies [6,7,12,14,17,20].",1
"Varying observations, however, have been made when determining whether a correlation between 25(OH)D and cathelicidin concentrations exists.",1
"In the literature, recent studies across a wide range of populations have demonstrated a positive correlation between 25(OH)D and cathelicidin [8–11,15,16,18,19].",1
"Differences in age, health and initial vitamin D status between cohorts, as well as study design, may explain the conflicting data.",1
"Of note, most of the children in this study were not vitamin D deficient and the vitamin D ranges were relatively narrow.",1
"Additionally, the lack of correlation may suggest that circulating cathelicidin concentration is not reflective of what is happening at the cellular level, and in this regard, cathelicidin mRNA expression by immune cells or target tissue may be a better indicator of vitamin D’s long-term effect on the cathelicidin system.",1
Adipose tissue is also believed to be associated with vitamin D [26–29].,1
"This result is consistent with the findings of Jeng et al., who also showed no correlation with BMI and cathelicidin in adults with sepsis [9].",1
"Although not significant, a negative trend was seen between the number of infections a child experienced and cathelicidin concentration.",1
"This suggests that cathelicidin may have a protective benefit in preventing disease, which is consistent with its antimicrobial properties.",1
This is an exciting area of study; especially as antibiotic resistance becomes an increasing problem.,1
"Investigating ways to improve natural immune function and limit the number of infections people experience is of great importance…\nIn this study, a positive correlation between age and cathelicidin was shown.",1
This positive correlation between cathelicidin and age was also shown in the oral environment when examining cathelicidin concentrations in saliva in healthy children aged 2 to 18 years [30].,1
"Importantly, as Alvarez–Rodriguez and colleagues have found a negative correlation between age and immune function in healthy adult subjects, especially those over the age of 60 [15], perhaps innate immune function, in particular cytokine function, increases with age for a period of time, reaches a threshold and then decreases later in life.",1
"Interestingly, our findings that male gender correlates with cathelicidin peeks further interest in understanding gender differences in regards to the immune system.",1
"Notably, in the aforementioned study examining localized cathelicidin concentrations in saliva, the female gender was found to positively correlate with cathelicidin [30].",1
These findings highlight the differences one may find when examining localized and circulating levels of immune factors.,1
Limitations of this study include the cohort size and an unequal distribution of subjects within age groups.,1
"As such, this study should be repeated with a larger sample size to replicate its findings.",1
Inclusion of older children and young adults would allow cathelicidin to be followed throughout a longer period of childhood development and further describe how cathelicidin and innate immune function develop over time.,1
"Lastly, total circulating cathelicidin was measured rather than cell-specific mRNA expression of cathelicidin or 1,25(OH)2D3concentration [17], which may be more closely linked with vitamin D status during fetal and childhood development.",1
"In conclusion, this study is the first to examine cathelicidin concentrations in healthy children over time.",1
It assists in identifying the normal ranges of circulating cathelicidin concentrations found in healthy children.,1
"It also supports the premise that cathelicidin increases with increasing age, particularly in males.",1
"With further study, cathelicidin may serve as a biomarker of enhanced immune function over time in children with age-based norms.",1
"Objective\nTo determine if the effects of HV gestational diets on obesogenic phenotypes in the offspring arise as a consequence of altered hypothalamic control of feeding behavior and if their increased food intake could be prevented by feeding them HV or high folate (10-fold folate, HFol) diets.",1
The HFol pup diet partially brought BDNF to the control level (P=0.02) and lowered SeroR2A (P=0.008).,1
"Conclusion\nThe obesogenic phenotype in offspring from HV fed dams is prevented by feeding HV or HFol pup diets, possibly due to post-weaning modulation of food intake regulatory mechanisms.",1
"INTRODUCTION\nDiets consumed during pregnancy and early postnatal life shape the developmental trajectory of the offspring.1,2Although vitamins contribute to all phases of development,3the effects of multivitamin consumption above requirements (but at non-toxic levels) during pregnancy as determinants of physiologic phenotypes of the offspring have received little attention.",1
"We have shown recently that feeding a diet containing 10-fold the recommended multivitamin content (HV) to Wistar rats during pregnancy results in increased food intake, obesity and characteristics of the metabolic syndrome in both adult male4and female5offspring weaned to the recommended vitamin (RV) diet.",1
"Because the hypothalamus is an important regulator of food intake and appetite control,6it can be hypothesized that the HV diet alters development of feeding neurocircuitry in the offspring resulting in an obesogenic phenotype.",1
"Disordered regulation of feeding pathways can affect growth and metabolism, consequently driving the appearance of metabolic syndrome later in life.7,8\nAn extension of the concept that early life factors contribute to chronic diseases is described by the predictive adaptive response (PAR) hypothesis, which suggests that a mismatch between in utero and postnatal environment increases the risk of developing disease in adulthood.9,10It has been proposed that the offspring modify their phenotype based on their in utero environment in order to adapt to the predicted postnatal setting.",1
"Based on the PAR hypothesis, the high multivitamin gestational diet would lead to developmental adaptation in the offspring consistent with a high vitamin post-weaning environment.",1
"If so, it would be predicted that it is this mismatch between the HV diet fed to the dams and the vitamin content of diets fed to the offspring that leads to an obesogenic phenotype.",1
"The effect of high vitamin maternal diets on chronic disease in the offspring can be attributed primarily to epigenetic modulation of gene expression leading to programming of regulatory systems.11Because methyl group vitamins, and specifically folate, have been shown to participate in epigenetic changes through its functions in DNA methylation,12we also fed offspring a high folate (HFol) diet.",1
"Therefore, we hypothesized that the effects of HV gestational diets on obesogenic phenotype in the offspring arise as a consequence of altered hypothalamic control of feeding behavior and these effects could be prevented by feeding them HV or HFol diets.",1
"Our primary objective was to compare the effects of RV, HV and HFol pup diets on food intake, body weight, glucose control and hypothalamic gene expression of feeding neuropeptides in offspring born to HV dams with offspring born to RV dams and weaned to RV diet.",1
The acceptance capacity of methyl groups in the whole genome is known to be inversely related to the exogenous3H-methyl incorporation.,1
"In contrast, male offspring from the HV dams weaned to either the HFol or HV pup diet did not differ in food intake, weight gain and glucose response compared to those from the RV dams (Figure 2,3,4).",1
Hypothalamic Gene Expression\nThe HV but not HFol pup diet brought POMC expression to control levels in mature offspring from HV dams (P=0.004) (Figure 5a).,1
The HV pup diet brought BDNF expression to control levels but the HFol pup diet only attenuated the decrease in expression caused by the HV gestational diet (P=0.02) (Figure 5a).,1
Only the HFol pup diet lowered SeroR2A expression compared to the HV offspring weaned to a RV pup diet (P=0.008) (Figure 5b).,1
There was a trend for lower DopaR1 expression in the HV offspring weaned to a HV pup diet compared to the RV offspring (P=0.06) (Figure 5b).,1
Folate Status\nBoth brain (Figure 6a) and plasma (Figure 6b) folate levels were unaffected by the diets of the dams but were elevated by the high multivitamin or high folate pup diet.,1
"DISCUSSION\nOur findings support the hypothesis that HV or HFol pup diet prevents the increase in food intake, body weight and glucose response to a glucose load in offspring of the HV dams, possibly by post-weaning changes in food intake regulatory systems.",1
"Although the role of hypothalamic regulation in determining the phenotype is uncertain, our gene expression data are novel because we show that feeding neurocircuitry undergoes modification both in utero and into maturity.",1
Two lines of evidence support the PAR hypothesis.,1
"First, an unmatched RV post-weaning diet fed the offspring born to HV dams resulted in increased food intake and characteristics of the metabolic syndrome, as observed previously.4Second, the HV and HFol post-weaning diets prevented these effects.",1
"There were significant effect of both diet and time, but no interaction between them on food intake and weight gain, suggesting that vitamin diets strongly alter the phenotype of mature offspring independent of time.",1
"Because the negative consequences of the HV gestational diet on food intake, weight gain and glucose control were prevented by feeding either the HV or HFol pup diets, these observations support the PAR hypothesis that offspring fed diets similar to their mothers lead to a more appropriate adaptation to their postnatal environment compared to those fed an unmatched diet.",1
"Elevated folate levels in the brain and plasma at maturity confirmed the folate content of the HV and HFol post-weaning diets, and importantly, revealed that the brain responds to the post-weaning diet.",1
"Although the HV and HFol post-weaning diets had similar effects on food intake, weight gain and blood glucose response by preventing the negative consequences of the HV gestational diet, they differed in their impact on expression in food intake regulatory genes in the hypothalamus.",1
"Overall the data support the hypothesis that the cause of the phenotype of HV offspring fed RV diets may be accounted for by its effects in utero on development of hypothalamic pathways of intake regulation, leading to excess food intake, and consequently increased body weight and characteristics of the metabolic syndrome.4Offspring born to dams fed the HV diet during pregnancy had lower expression of POMC and BDNF, which are anorexigenic (appetite-suppressing) genes,20,21compared to those born to dams on the RV diet.",1
Lower expression of the anorexigenic genes in the offspring of dams fed the multivamins during pregnancy is consistent with the observed increased food intake.,1
Our results are consistent with other data showing that early nutrition alters the central appetite regulatory network.22Effects of the maternal diet on the hypothalamic expression of food intake regulatory pathways were found in lambs of ewes fed a diet that exceeded their energy requirement.,1
"These lambs were fatter but had higher hypothalamic POMC expression at postnatal day 30 and relative milk intake of these lambs was not different from those born to control-fed mothers after the third postnatal week.23In contrast, the data from the present study show that higher food intake in adulthood of offspring born to the HV dams and fed the RV diet is consistent with their lower expression of anorexigenic neuropeptides in the hypothalamus.",1
"However, there was no gestational HV diet effect on expression of leptin and insulin receptors, which are known to modulate expression of orexigenic and anorexigenic neurons regulating energy intake.24–26Despite this lack of difference, other neurons downstream regulating food intake such as POMC and BDNF may be affected by the high vitamin diets.",1
A novel observation of our study is that the hypothalamic feeding pathways respond to the vitamin content of the post-weaning diet.,1
"Because expression of these anorexigenic neuropeptides was normalized, it may be suggested that vitamin content of post-weaning diets contribute to remodeling of hypothalamic functioning in mature as well as developing rats.",1
"Furthermore, there was a trend for lower expression of DopaR1 in the HV offspring weaned to a HV diet compared to the control offspring.",1
"In the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, dopamine release is required to initiate a meal, and is positively associated with meal number and duration.27,28By possibly reducing dopamine signaling, the HV pup diet may have provided some protection against excess food intake caused by the HV gestational diet.",1
"Although we are the first to show that the brain at maturity responds to vitamins, our results are substantiated by a report of hypothalamic changes in the food intake regulatory genes due to the interaction of maternal and post-weaning diets high in saturated fats in male offspring.29\nSurprisingly, a ten-fold addition of folate alone to the RV diet modified some of the effects of the maternal HV diet on the offspring, suggesting a possible primary role for this methyl group vitamin.",1
"A significant role for folate in the complete vitamin mixture in determining the effect of the HV diet was supported by the reductions in food intake, body weight and blood glucose.",1
"However, folate had fewer effects on the hypothalamus of offspring born to HV dams.",1
"Because POMC was not brought to control levels, vitamins other than folate may play a role in correcting POMC.",1
"The HFol pup diet reduced SeroR2A expression in mature offspring of the dams fed the HV diet, but not by the HV pup diet (Figure 5b).",1
"BDNF was corrected to similar levels by the HV diet, and only partially by the HFol pup diet.",1
"Previous studies have shown that BDNF increases serotonin turnover in the hypothalamus,30,31suggesting that the effect of gestational and post-weaning diets on BDNF mRNA levels may explain some compensatory response in SeroR2A expression.",1
The fact that we did not observe differences in other subtypes of SeroR may indicate that SeroR2A is more sensitive to BDNF-induced changes by the vitamin diets.,1
"Because BDNF may be differentially expressed in specific regions of the hypothalamus, where high levels are present in the ventromedial hypothalamus,32the relationship between BDNF and SeroR is unknown from whole hypothalamus in our study.",1
"Although folate has been shown to be an active participant in methyltransfer reactions,12global methylation was not affected by either the gestational or post-weaning diet.",1
"However this is not surprising because previous studies have reported that DNA methylation of genes in the absence of a detectable change in global methylation, suggesting that epigenetic changes are site-specific.33In addition, the RV, HV and HFol diets in our study contain high amounts of choline, which is another factor affecting DNA methylation,34,35and it alone may have obscured detection of the effect of folate on methylation.",1
The metabolism of choline and other methyl group vitamins (ie.,1
"folate, vitamin B6 and B12) is closely linked.36\nA significant weakness of the study arises from the lack of measurement of gene expression at different stages of maturity.",1
"Thus, we do not know the stage of maturation when the post-weaning diets altered the hypothalamus.",1
"In addition to hypothalamic genes, measurement of genes in regions of the brain involved in reward and motivation may have contributed to a fuller understanding of the overall impact of the diets on regulation of food intake.",1
"It has been shown that mice fed post-weaning a high fat diet (60% calories from fat) had lower expression of the μ-opioid receptor gene which influences reward circuitry in the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex.37\nIn conclusion, the obesogenic phenotype in offspring from HV fed dams may be a consequence of altered hypothalamic control of feeding behavior but can be prevented by feeding them HV or HFol pup diets.",1
A randomized controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation on perinatal depression: in Iranian pregnant mothers\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nMood disorders in pregnancy and post-partum period are common and considered as a public health issue.,1
"Researchers have studied the relationship between low serum vitamin D concentration and perinatal depression, although no clinical trial has been conducted on vitamin D’s effects on depression related to childbirth.",1
This study evaluated the effect of vitamin D3supplementation on perinatal depression scores.,1
Results\nThe two groups were similar in relation to baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations.,1
"However, at childbirth, the vitamin D group had significantly higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration in comparison to the control group ( p\u2009<\u20090.001 ).",1
Conclusions\nThe present trial showed that consuming 2000\xa0IU vitamin D3daily during late pregnancy was effective in decreasing perinatal depression levels.,1
We suggest further clinical trial in pregnant mothers who are at risk for postnatal depression.,1
Background\nMood disorders in pregnancy and post-partum period are common and considered as a public health issue.,1
"In recent decades researchers have paid great amount of attention to these subjects and showed that mood illness related to childbirth can lead to serious complications for mother, fetus, newborn and family [1,2].",1
Evidence shows that postnatal depression is an extension of antenatal depression which continues postpartum.,1
"This problem can have negative effects on infant development and can cause behavioral, cognitive, social and emotional problems in infant which could continue throughout childhood [3–5].",1
Prevalence of postpartum depression varies throughout the world; however researchers have used different scales and cut off points to describe this psychological disorder.,1
This study has reported the prevalence of postnatal depression up to 60\xa0% [6].,1
"The prevalence of postnatal depression in some Asian countries has been reported between 22 and 46.9\xa0% [7,8].",1
Several studies have shown a high prevalence of postnatal depression in Iran.,1
"In the meta-analysis of Veisani et al., postnatal depression was reported at 25.3\xa0% [9], and in two recent studies in eastern and central part of Iran, the prevalence has been reported at 28.9–34.8\xa0% [10,11].",1
"The spread and importance of postpartum depression have led researchers to create preventative methods such as educational programs, modified care, dietary supplements, antidepressant medication and social support [12–14].",1
"While, the circulating half-life of 1, 25(OH) 2D is around 4\xa0h. Its blood concentration is 1000 times less than 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Serum levels of PTH, calcium, and phosphate have influence on regulatory and production of 1,25(OH)2D.",1
Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D reflects the body’s vitamin D reserves and this is a well-known indicator for examining vitamin D status [15].,1
"Several studies have revealed that vitamin D supplementation can raise vitamin D reserves gradually, according to baseline concentration of vitamin D, dose and duration of consumption [16–18].",1
"In accordance to a guideline by Holick et al., 6–8 weeks consumption of a high dose vitamin D supplement are essential to obtain an adequate blood reserves of vitamin D [19].",1
"It seems that in addition to calcium homeostasis and bone health, vitamin D is also essential for brain development and function [20,21].",1
"Therefore, the brain can regionally activate vitamin D, which implicates vitamin D’s role in brain function more prominent [22–25].",1
"Studies have shown that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration is associated with psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression and reduced cognitive function [26,27].",1
"Few case reports have suggested an interaction between season or latitude and psychological problems [28,29].",1
"In a study by Mozaffari- Khosravi et al., high doses of vitamin D have been effective in men and women who were depressed [30].",1
suggested that more accurate clinical trials are required to reach a conclusion about the effectiveness of vitamin D on depression [31].,1
"Considering the possible connection between low serum vitamin D and depression, researchers studied the relationship between low vitamin D and perinatal depression.",1
"in a study with a small sample size (97\xa0participants), observed an association between maternal low serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and high depression scores within several post-partum visits [32].",1
studied the relationship between the maternal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations measured in the 18thweek of gestation and postnatal depression in 796 people.,1
They found that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in the second trimester were a risk factor for postnatal depression.,1
studied the association between maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and antenatal depression.,1
It has been shown that mothers with higher depression scores had lower levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D compared to who had lower depression scores [34].,1
"On the contrary to the above mentioned studies, Neilson et al., in a case–control study, found that an increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D level can enhance the possibility of postnatal depression.",1
"They have stated that, these unexpected results could be due to genetic differences which lead to a disturbance in conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D into its active form, calcitriol [35].",1
"According to our knowledge, there was no clinical trial that has evaluated the effectiveness of vitamin D on perinatal depression.",1
"Hence, we aimed this study to assess the effectiveness of vitamin D3supplementation on antenatal and postnatal depression levels.",1
Advantage of this questionnaire is that it focuses on psychological signs of depression rather than physical signs [36].,1
"After that, several studies have validated its use throughout the antenatal period [37–39].",1
"In western studies, this questionnaire has had high reliability and validity [40,41].",1
"Cut-off points with values more than 9, 12, 13, and 14 were used in different studies to determine perinatal depression [37,43,44].",1
"In the present study, we used the cut-off point of\u2009>\u200913 as greater likelihood of having depression disorder, according to Mazhari and Nakhaee’s study in Iranian population [42].",1
"Therefore, at baseline we excluded those mothers with the EPDS scores of >13 and they were referred to a psychologist for further evaluation and management.",1
The cut-off points of <9 and 9–13 were used as low and moderate risk for depression.,1
"According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), we considered vitamin D deficiency as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of less than 20\xa0ng/ml.",1
"We also considered vitamin D insufficiency as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of 21–29\xa0ng/ml, and the participants who had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of\u2009≥\u200930\xa0ng/ml as sufficient [19,46].",1
"Intervention in the supplement consumer (vitamin D) group: In 2007 and 2010, the Canadian Pediatric Association recommended a daily amount of 2000\xa0IU of vitamin D for pregnant and breast-feeding women [47,46].",1
"Therefore, this group received two 1000 unit vitamin D3pills (Totally 2000\xa0IU) daily from the 26–28 weeks of gestation until childbirth.",1
"In Iran, iron and folic acid supplements are routinely given to all pregnant mothers and some mothers based on doctors’ order may consume multivitamins or calcium.",1
The multivitamin supplementations contained 200–400\xa0IU of vitamin D.\n\nSample size and statistical analysis\nWe could not find a similar study to use its means for determining the sample size.,1
"Therefore, considering the following values: effect size\u2009=\u20090.5, α\u2009=\u20090.05, β\u2009=\u20090.20, to the power of 80\xa0% and using the formula (16/∆2, ∆\u2009=\u20090.05), the sample size was estimated at 64 in each group.",1
"Considering the possible losses, the sample size was set at 74 people in each group finally.",1
We conducted stratified analyses by parity status to assess whether the trend of effectiveness is different among the two nulliparous and multiparous subgroups.,1
16/169 women did not refer to the lab.,1
Another significant factor for sample loss was that a number of the women did not return to the specified hospital for childbirth.,1
"However, they were different regarding to using other supplements outside the study’s protocol and planned pregnancy (Table\xa01).",1
"Only, 4 women (2.2\xa0%) were sufficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration of ≥\u200930\xa0ng/mL).",1
"While, the mean depression scores were significantly lower in the vitamin D group than the control one at 38–40 weeks of gestation ( p \u2009=\u20090.01) also, at 4 and 8 weeks after birth ( p \u2009>\u20090.001) (Table\xa03).",1
"Results showed that in the vitamin D group the number of participants with depression scores of <9 were more than the control group at 38–40 weeks of gestation also, at 4 and 8 weeks after birth (Table\xa03).",1
The repeated measures analysis showed that the control group had gone through significant changes with regards to depression scores ( p \u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.,1
"However, the scores at 4 and 8 weeks after birth were lower than the baseline depression scores (( p \u2009=\u20090.048 and p \u2009=\u20090.014, respectively).",1
"2\n\nWithin groups comparison related to depression scores: The results showed, between the two groups, the difference regards to over-time reduction of depression scores was significant ( p \u2009<\u20090.001)\nThe vitamin D group also had gone through changes with regards to their depression scores ( p \u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.",1
"Pairwise comparisons showed that the scores at 38–40 weeks, 4 and 8 weeks postpartum were significantly lower than the baseline depression scores ( p \u2009<\u20090.001).",1
"However, the depression scores at 4 and 8 weeks after birth were not different significantly ( p \u2009=\u20090.217).",1
"The results showed that in both subgroups, the vitamin D group had statistically significant higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations at childbirth and lower depression score at 4 and 8 weeks postpartum than the control group (Table\xa04).",1

Discussion\nThis clinical trial evaluated the effect of 2000\xa0IU of vitamin D3supplement per day during late pregnancy on perinatal depression.,1
"According to our knowledge, this study was the first trial held on vitamin D and perinatal depression.",1
"Results showed that at baseline, in 72.8\xa0% of the participants, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were lower than20 ng/mL.",1
They were suffering from vitamin D deficiency based on new perspective towards normal serum vitamin D concentration [46].,1
"Although 67.3\xa0% of the blood samples were taken in the winter, 81\xa0% of the participants were exposed to sunlight or had outdoor activities for at least 15\xa0min per day.",1
"Considering the factors affecting vitamin D production such as clothing type, skin color and the time of day being exposed to the sun [48–50], these results are justifiable.",1
"Vitamin D deficiency is a widespread global problem, which even can observe in the countries which get enough sunlight [49,51].",1
The high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Iran was showed in numerous studies.,1
"Saki et al., showed high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in southern Iranian children, more than 80\xa0% were deficient [53].",1
"found vitamin D deficiency in 52.9\xa0% of women aged 20–74 years in Shiraz, Iran [54].",1
"In the present study, the mean vitamin D concentrations in vitamin D group were significantly higher after taking 2000\xa0IU of vitamin D supplementation per day for at least 8 weeks.",1
"Nonetheless, only 9.7\xa0% in the vitamin D group achieved serum concentrations higher than 30\xa0ng/mL.",1
"In contrast, in the previous studies 2000\xa0IU vitamin D supplementation was more sufficient to increase serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations up to the adequate amount (≥32\xa0ng/mL) [18,57,58].",1
"In those studies, vitamin D supplementations started at the end of the first trimester or at the beginning of the second trimester and their participants had higher initial 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations compared to the participants in our study.",1
"Therefore, it is justifiable that in our study, vitamin D group had lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration compared to those were in the study by Taheri et al.",1
"Considering cut-off point of ≥9, data analysis showed that a lot of participants (more than 50\xa0%) were susceptible to prenatal depression at 26–28 weeks.",1
"In previous studies, the prevalence of antenatal depression had been studied, using various tools and cut-off points.",1
"Depression was reported in 8.6\xa0% of European mothers, in 19.5\xa0% of Middle Eastern mothers, and in 17.5\xa0% of South Asian mothers.",1
"However, the EPDS has been widely used in screening, not providing a diagnosis, for perinatal depression, it has been reported that its score is highly correlated with physician diagnostic opinion.",1
"Several studies have been shown that, with cutoff score of 12–13, this scale develops into more indicative in identifying real depression in women [36,37,42].",1
"The participants who had depression scores of >13 were exited from this clinical trial and referred to psychiatrist for further assessment and treatment, because, the nature of our study was preventative than management.",1
"While in a study by Cassidy- Bushrow et al., in African-American women, an inverse relationship was observed between maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration at the early stages of pregnancy and antenatal depression.",1
"There was an inverse relationship between the vitamin D logarithm and depression scores, as by adding one unit to the vitamin D concentration logarithm, equal to 2.72\xa0ng/mL, a 46\xa0% reduction in the depression scores occurred [63].",1
"In another study in US, in 498 pregnant mothers with the mean gestational age of 15\xa0weeks, generally there was an inverse relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and depression level.",1
It is worth mentioning that their tools for determining depression were different than ours.,1
It was a possible reason that we did not observe any relationship between antenatal depression score and 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration.,1
"Also in our study, selection of participants at the beginning was through convenience method.",1
"Surprisingly, the change in vitamin D concentration (baseline to childbirth) was not correlated with changes in depression scores from baseline to 38–40 weeks of gestation or to 4 and 8 weeks postpartum.",1
The present trial showed that consuming 2000\xa0IU vitamin D3per day in late pregnancy was effective in decreasing depression scores in perinatal period.,1
The vitamin D and control groups were similar regarding to general characteristics except for two variables: unplanned pregnancy and using other supplements out of the study’s protocol.,1
Previous studies reported that unplanned pregnancy is a risk factor for perinatal depression.,1
"Nonetheless, in our study, the vitamin D group had significantly lower depression scores after intervention.",1
The effectiveness of calcium supplementation on prevention of perinatal depression has been shown in a previous study [65].,1
"The control group consumed extra supplements such as calcium more frequently, nonetheless this group had significantly higher depression scores compared to vitamin D group.",1
"Previous clinical trials, in which vitamin D supplementations were consumed during pregnancy [18,58], have not evaluated the antenatal and postnatal depression disorders.",1
"However in a cross-sectional study in Japan, higher dietary vitamin D intake was independently associated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy [66].",1
"On the other hand, the effect of vitamin D on depression in non-pregnant people are not entirely clear.",1
Some clinical trials in non-pregnant people showed that vitamin D was effective in decreasing depression level.,1
"In a study by Mozafari- Khosravi et al., 300,000 and 150,000\xa0IU vitamin D were administered by injection to the two groups who suffered depression and the third group did not receive vitamin D. High doses of vitamin D were effective in decreasing depression levels after 3\xa0months [30].",1
"In contrast, in another study 40,000\xa0IU vitamin D per week was used for 6\xa0months, but vitamin D was not effective in decreasing depression level compared to the control group [68].",1
found that 5000\xa0IU vitamin D per day for 6\xa0weeks had no effect on men and women’s cognitive and emotional function [69].,1
Vitamin D can affect brain function in several ways.,1
"The existence of receptors for the active form of vitamin D (1, 25(OH)2D) in the brain induces a direct effect.",1
Its indirect effects are attributed to vitamin D’s effects on improvement of muscle activities.,1
"As a result of this improvement, physical activity increases and this have positive effects on health.",1
An increase in vitamin D can cause parathyroid hormones to decrease.,1
"An increase in this hormone can lead to brain dysfunctions [70,71].",1
"On the other hand, cytokines are messengers produced by immune cells which affect all tissues, including brain.",1
"Nowadays, we know that brain cells such as microglia and astrocytes, can secrete cytokines.",1
Vitamin D may act as an anti-inflammatory agent in the brain by keeping harmful pro-inflammatory cytokines in check.,1
Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to pro-inflammatory disease.,1
"It is also possible that as a result of vascular changes in pregnancy the maternal cerebral environment is more vulnerable to inflammation perhaps, explaining in part the link between vitamin D and depression in pregnancy.",1
"In light of the inflammatory nature of depression and the strong role of vitamin D as an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulator, inflammation may mediate the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and depression during pregnancy [73,74].",1
"Previous studies have suggested that perinatal depression is more frequent and serious in primiparous women than multiparous women [75,76].",1
It was interesting to investigate trend of vitamin D effectiveness in the two primiparous and multiparous subgroups.,1
The findings were similar to the overall population except one thing.,1
Staying on vitamin D consumption until childbirth resulted in higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration that induced the effect on postnatal depression exceeding than prenatal depression.,1
A difference in nature of antenatal depression compared to postnatal depression can reflect another possible reason for achieving this result.,1
Depression scores decreased in the both our groups over time which indicates that depression could be more critical during pregnancy than postpartum period.,1
The pleasant feeling of motherhood can probably play a role in decreasing depression specially in primiparous mothers [77].,1
"During pregnancy, women are worried about risks to their own and the fetus health.",1
Fear of labor pain is another concern of the modern-day mothers [78].,1
"Therefore, a decreased perinatal depression level is justifiable.",1
"On the other hand, the difference between the two groups was meaningful concerning over-time reduction of depression.",1
"Meaning that over time, depression scores decreased much more in the vitamin D group in comparison to control group and this shows the possible effects of the vitamin D3supplementation.",1
Another finding of this study was that vitamin D3supplementation was effective in decreasing depression level in both nulliparous and multiparous subgroups.,1
"Therefore, the participants’ honesty was one of this research limits.",1
This group of participants may not be representative of the target population.,1
"Since mothers with depression level of >13 were excluded from this study, the results can not extend to mothers with high levels of depression.",1
"Also, since more than 95\xa0% of the mothers had lower than 30\xa0ng/mL serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration, it is not clear if the same results would be observed in mothers with higher levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Therefore, we suggest further clinical trials, using 2000\xa0IU vitamin D on a larger population, mothers with high levels of depression, and high serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations.",1
"The last weakness of this study was that it had the statistical authority to identify differences in depressive symptoms, but not in the diagnoses of major depressive disorder.",1
"Conclusion\nIn the present study, it was observed that 2000\xa0IU vitamin D3per day for at least 8 weeks during late pregnancy, can be effective in decreasing perinatal depression levels (at 38–40 weeks of gestation also, at 4 and 8 weeks after birth).",1
"Environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity: potential public health concerns\n\nAbstractAbstract\nThroughout our lives, epigenetic processes shape our development and enable us to adapt to a constantly changing environment.",1
Identifying and understanding environmentally induced epigenetic change(s) that may lead to adverse outcomes is vital for protecting public health.,1
"This review, therefore, examines the present understanding of epigenetic mechanisms involved in the mammalian life cycle, evaluates the current evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity in human cohorts and rodent models and highlights the research considerations and implications of this emerging knowledge for public health and regulatory toxicology.",1
"Many hundreds of studies have investigated such toxicity, yet relatively few have demonstrated a mechanistic association among specific environmental exposures, epigenetic changes and adverse health outcomes in human epidemiological cohorts and/or rodent models.",1
"While this small body of evidence is largely composed of exploratory in vivo high-dose range studies, it does set a precedent for the existence of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity.",1
"Consequently, there is worldwide recognition of this phenomenon, and discussion on how to both guide further scientific research towards a greater mechanistic understanding of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity in humans, and translate relevant research outcomes into appropriate regulatory policies for effective public health protection.",1
Introduction\nThe belief that the sequence of our DNA (our genome) is the sole determinant of our life-long development and health has long been regarded as too simplistic.,1
"Darwin’s ‘On the Origin of the Species’ highlighted the role of the environment in the process of evolution, the natural selection of advantageous genetic mutations through environmental pressures (Darwin1859).",1
It has also been recognized that the pace of such change is sometimes too rapid to be accounted for by natural selection.,1
"First Lamarck, and then Waddington, suggested that alternative mechanisms, now termed epigenetics, must also contribute to phenotypic outcomes (Noble2006).",1
"It is the complex interaction among our genome, epigenome and environment that shapes our development into unique individuals, and thus influences our health and potentially the health of our future offspring.",1
"The induction of adverse DNA mutations by environmental factors that lead to disease, particularly cancer, is well established and recognized by regulatory bodies worldwide.",1
"There are, however, no current established regulatory procedures or guidelines in chemical safety programs for determining environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity.",1
"We, therefore, wanted to examine both the potential public health concerns and the resulting regulatory implications of such toxicity.",1
"These were then further evaluated and collated to provide a critical review that summarizes the main epigenetic mechanisms important during the mammalian life cycle, evaluates the current evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity in human cohorts and rodents models, and highlights the research considerations and implications of this emerging knowledge for public health and regulatory toxicology.",1
"[""Environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity is an issue that has been highlighted as a current research focus within Public Health England’s (PHE's) Center for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards (CRCE), the wider PHE organization as part of the early life priority ‘ensuring every child has the best start in life’, and the international research and governmental communities.""]",1
"By identifying and contributing to the knowledge gaps PHE, and similar organizations worldwide, can ensure that they stay fully aware of the current situation and are in the best position to give advice and put forward any necessary recommendations and policies to protect public health against such toxicity.",1
"Methylation at CGIs is generally associated with transcriptional repression, although the local CpG density within a specific promoter can contribute to the actual transcriptional effect (Hackett & Surani2013; Messerschmidt et\xa0al.2014).",1
Much less is known about the mechanisms of DNA demethylation.,1
It has long been suggested that 5mC can be removed by both passive (through lack of maintenance during replication) and active (enzymatic) mechanisms.,1
"Yet, specific DNA demethylase enzyme(s) in mammals remained elusive until the discovery of the 10–11 translocation (TET) enzyme family.",1
"This family, which can oxidize 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and further to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxycytosine (5caC) (Tahiliani et\xa0al.2009; Ito et\xa0al.2011), has fueled research into indirect active DNA demethylation pathways.",1
"Consequently, a range of mechanisms for the demethylation of DNA have been proposed (described in relation to mammalian development in Dean2014; Messerschmidt et\xa0al.2014; Messerschmidt,2016).",1
It was widely believed that these 20–30\u2009000 protein-coding genes were the sole mediators and executors of all cellular functions.,1
The remaining 95–99% of the genome was regarded as ‘junk’ DNA.,1
"However, a functional role for ncDNA was inferred from the strong correlation between increasing ncDNA abundance and increasing organism complexity (Mattick2007).",1
"Indeed, over the last decade, the previous gene-centric dogma, central to molecular biology, has been shown to be incorrect.",1
"[""All these mechanisms play critical roles throughout normal mammalian development, particularly during early embryo and germ cell development (Cook & Blelloch2013; Beaujean2014; Dean2014; Hale et\xa0al.2014; Luk et\xa0al.2014; Messerschmidt et\xa0al.2014; Mukherjee et\xa0al.2014; O'Doherty & McGettigan2014; Grote & Herrmann2015; Hogg & Western2015; Marcho et\xa0al.2015).""]",1
"As with any rapidly developing field, there is a continuous generation of new information that must be incorporated as appropriate, such as novel histone or DNA modifications and ncRNAs families implicated in the epigenetic regulation of the mammalian life cycle (Dean2014; Hale et\xa0al.2014; Messerschmidt et\xa0al.2014; Sun et\xa0al.2014; Garcia-Lopez et\xa0al.2015; Sharma et\xa0al.2016); and new functions for existing epigenetic mechanisms within mammalian development (Gou et\xa0al.2014; Kuramochi-Miyagawa et\xa0al.2008; Watanabe et\xa0al.2008,2011; Li et\xa0al.2015, Pantano et\xa0al.2015; Williams et\xa0al.2015; Zhang et\xa0al.2015).",1
"Such epigenetic processes can be perturbed by environmental factors, potentially leading to an adverse phenotypic outcome.",1
"It is worth noting that some genomic regions escape this first global ‘reset’, including imprinted control regions (ICRs) and the most active TEs.",1
"The placenta and brain, in particular, express many of the imprinted genes, in keeping with experimentally identified roles for imprinted genes in prenatal nutrient acquisition and growth regulation, neurodevelopment, and postnatal energy homeostasis and behavior.",1
"It is, therefore, vital for normal embryo development that these imprints are maintained during the first global epigenetic re-programing event.",1
"Similarly, the activation of TEs would be deleterious for the embryonic genome and so the continued silencing of such loci through early embryogenesis is essential for genome stability and subsequent normal development.",1
It is essential for the generation of subsequent germ cells (and thus the successful production of future generations) that parental imprints within PGCs are removed and new imprints are re-established according to the gender of the embryo.,1
The mechanisms protecting specific genomic regions from epigenetic re-programing are not yet well-understood.,1
"However, some recent insights are presented and discussed in Hatanaka et\xa0al.",1
"Thus, a similar sncRNA switch, this time back to increased genome protection makes functional sense.",1
"Finally, it is important to note that histone modifications, DNA methylation and ncRNAs are not separate processes; they are closely linked throughout mammalian development.",1
"Thus, all the machinery involved in these pathways, including DNA and RNA binding and modifying proteins, are epigenetically important.",1
"While such complex networks exist to maintain cellular homeostasis, they are open to environmental perturbation (Figure 1).",1
"Indeed, numerous environmental factors have been shown to induce epigenetic changes via a variety of mechanisms.",1
"These include both direct and indirect processes that ultimately lead to alterations in DNA methylation, histone modification and/or ncRNA expression.",1
Both chemically induced DNA adducts and those generated as a consequence of reactive oxygen species damage resulting from chemical exposure can interfere with the ability of epigenetic machinery to interact with DNA (Baccarelli & Bollati2009; Ruiz-Hernandez et\xa0al.2015).,1
"Reactive oxygen species are also proposed to stimulate the production of alpha-ketoglutarate, a co-substrate for TETs and one of the two main classes of histone demethylases (Chervona & Costa2012; Ruiz-Hernandez et\xa0al.2015).",1
Additional epigenetic mechanisms are likely to be elucidated as research continues.,1
"It is when these environmentally induced perturbations exceed the capacity of the cell to maintain homeostasis that epigenetic toxicity occurs, potentially leading to altered phenotypes and adversely impacting public health.",1
"Even in adulthood the same epigenetic processes drive cell proliferation, differentiation, function and adaptation.",1
"Environmentally induced epigenetic changes later in life can, therefore, also influence an individual’s health.",1
"Indeed, numerous adult onset diseases have been associated with abnormal epigenetic changes, including cancer, diabetes, and neurological, renal, cardiac and respiratory conditions (Hamm & Costa2015); and epigenetic processes play a key role in initiating the onset of puberty, changes to which can also increase the risk of some of these adult onset diseases (Rzeczkowska et\xa0al.2014).",1
"However, certain stages in development and cell types can be thought of as particularly sensitive to epigenetic change due to the resulting severity of the outcome for the individual or the potential for affecting multiple generations.",1
Early life\nEarly embryo and germ line development can be affected by in utero exposures.,1
Environmentally induced epigenetic changes during the vital first developmental re-programing and programing event could result in incorrect erasure and/or re-establishment of the embryo epigenome.,1
"This could lead to activation of TEs, and abnormal imprinting and gene expression.",1
"Such changes could have far-reaching consequences on embryo viability and development (including early germ line formation), and thus subsequent future health and fertility.",1
"It is also important to consider, however, early ex utero exposures.",1
"Early childhood and adolescence are also periods of significant growth and development, so it is easy to envisage how environmentally induced epigenetic changes during these stages could have detrimental effects on future health and fertility.",1
"Gametogenesis and pre-conception\nSpermatogenesis occurs continuously in adult males and even though females are born with their full complement of oocytes, oocyte maturation occurs in a continuous cycle throughout the reproductive life of adult females.",1
"Thus, environmental exposures to those oocytes and spermatozoa that go onto produce an embryo (pre-conception exposures) are also an important consideration.",1
"Environmentally induced epigenetic changes in the sperm or egg prior to conception could, therefore, affect embryo viability and development and the subsequent future health and fertility of the next generation.",1
"Indeed, murine spermatozoal miRNAs and/or esiRNAs have been shown to function in fertilization and early embryo development (Liu et\xa0al.2012,2016; Yuan et\xa0al.2016), and to influence phenotypic outcomes in subsequent progeny (Rassoulzadegan et\xa0al.2006; Wagner et\xa0al.2008; Grandjean et\xa0al.2009).",1
"Moreover, subsequent studies have further demonstrated that early life trauma or parental stress can induce altered miRNA expression in sperm, which in turn can transmit behavioral and metabolic abnormalities through to the next murine generation (Rodgers et\xa0al.2013; Gapp et\xa0al.2014; Rodgers et\xa0al.2015).",1
"It is also worth noting that some of these RNA-mediated phenotypes have been shown to be dependent upon the remaining member of the DNMT family, DNMT2 (Kiani et\xa0al.2013).",1
"Although DNMT2 has demonstrated some weak DNMT activity, it is predominantly associated with RNA, particularly tRNA, methylation, potentially contributing to the regulation of RNA stability and translation (Motorin et\xa0al.2010).",1
"Somatic versus germ cell change\nIf an epigenetic change occurs in a somatic cell or in a germ cell that is correctly ‘reset’ during germ line development in the subsequent offspring, then only one generation will be affected.",1
"However, if an epigenetic change becomes permanently established in the germ line, it will be transmitted across future generations, even in the absence of the original stimulus.",1
"Recent data has extended this list to include specific regions not associated with TEs that are preferentially located within CGIs, enhancers, promoters and gene bodies (Seisenberger et\xa0al.2012; Hackett et\xa0al.2013; Tang et\xa0al.2015).",1
"These both provide evidence that DNA methylation can be stably inherited, and highlight specific loci protected from global epigenetic erasure that could be involved in transmitting epigenetic information across generations.",1
"These retained histones are not randomly distributed throughout the male genome, they are particularly enriched at the promoters of developmental genes.",1
"Thus, spermatozoal chromatin may also transmit unique epigenetic information that helps to activate and regulate early embryo development and contribute to epigenetic inheritance across multiple generations.",1
This so-called transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is a hotly debated topic.,1
Much of the controversy is concerned with multigenerational versus transgenerational epigenetic toxicity (or epigenetic effect(s) versus epigenetic inheritance) (Figure 3).,1
"If an environmental exposure is truly transgenerational, then: (1) following an in utero exposure the resulting change penetrates to at least the F3generation (great-great grandchildren), where F0is the exposed mother and F3represents the first non-exposed generation; or (2) following an ex utero exposure in childhood/adulthood the resulting change penetrates to at least the F2generation (the great-grandchildren), where F0is the exposed generation and F2represents the first non-exposed generation.",1
A transgenerational change thus represents epigenetic inheritance.,1
"Conversely, a multigenerational change represents an epigenetic effect that affects multiple generations, all of which were exposed to the original stimulus, either directly as the exposed mother or child/adult or indirectly as an embryo or PGC within the exposed generation.",1
"With respect to public health, however, this is mere semantics; both could have far-reaching consequences for the present and future health of human populations.",1
It is not necessarily important whether an environmental exposure induces adverse outcomes in multiple exposed or non-exposed generations.,1
The fact that it may cause epigenetic toxicity in any generation makes it relevant to public health.,1
"Penetration of adverse effect(s) to the first non-exposed generation (the F3generation following in utero exposure, or the F2generation following ex utero exposure) represents true epigenetic inheritance and thus transgenerational toxicity.",1
"Adverse effect(s) that affect multiple generations, all of which were exposed either directly or indirectly to the original factor represent epigenetic effect(s) and thus multigenerational toxicity.",1
"Current evidence for putative environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity\n\nHuman cohorts\nFor many decades, there have been epidemiological studies linking the risks of adverse phenotypes to a wide range of environmental factors.",1
"For example, pre-conception, in utero or childhood undernutrition have been associated with an increased risk of developing various adult-onset diseases, including psychiatric disorders, type 2 diabetes and obesity, in numerous famine cohorts such as the Dutch Hunger Winter, the Chinese Great Leap Forward and the Överkalix cohorts (Lumey et\xa0al.2011; Pembrey et\xa0al.2014).",1
"Likewise, metabolic syndromes, hormonal perturbation, reduced sperm quality and increased cancer risks have been associated with chemical and radiation exposures in the survivors of human disasters, including the Seveso dioxin release, the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs and the Chernobyl nuclear accident (Warner et\xa0al.2011,2013; Foley et\xa0al.2015; Kamiya et\xa0al.2015).",1
"In addition, large human cohorts that have recruited participants at birth for long-term follow up with comprehensive data and sample collection, such as the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort (Boyd et\xa0al.2013), provide a wealth of information to investigate epidemiological links between specific environmental exposures and public health outcomes.",1
"There have been over 1200 publications using data from ALSPAC (ALSPAC 2016), many of which have linked pre-conception and in utero environmental factors (including chemicals, pharmaceuticals, nutrition, smoking, anxiety and depression) with adverse outcomes (such as asthma and other respiratory disorders, increased weight/BMI-related issues and behavioral problems) (Golding2010; Boyd et\xa0al.2013).",1
"In particular, studies examining the parental and grandparental smoking status have demonstrated an interesting gender-specific association between paternal pre-conception or grandmaternal in utero exposure to cigarette smoke and increased weight-related issues in the subsequent sons and grandsons, but not daughters or granddaughters (Pembrey et\xa0al.2014).",1
"Gender-specific effects were also observed in a number of the famine cohorts, with an increased risk of obesity occurring in female descendants only (Lumey et\xa0al.2011; Pembrey et\xa0al.2014).",1
"The association of later life health with pre-conception, in utero or childhood environmental factors has led to the “Developmental Origins of Health and Disease” (DOHaD) hypothesis (Wadhwa et\xa0al.2009).",1
"The DOHaD hypothesis evolved from Barker’s “thrifty phenotype” hypothesis originally proposed over 25 years ago (reviewed in Barker2007), and was formed “to recognise….the concept that the early life environment has widespread consequences for later health” (Wadhwa et\xa0al.2009).",1
"This concept of phenotypic plasticity, particularly as a consequence of different environments in early life, implicates epigenetic mechanisms and has fueled research into environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity.",1
We therefore sought to review the existing literature (up to 7 March 2016) to evaluate the current evidence for such toxicity.,1
"These studies can be ranked into categories that demonstrate (1) associations between environmental exposure(s), global epigenetic change(s) and adverse phenotype(s); (2) associations between environmental exposure(s), specific epigenetic changes(s) and adverse phenotypes(s) (including further subcategories, such as size and nature of cohort, type of sample analyzed, use of case controls, dose- and/or time-dependent changes, single changes within relevant biological pathways, multiple changes within the same biological pathway, correlation of changes with gene expression at mRNA and/or protein level, use of additional mechanistically relevant controls, robust statistical analysis, validation in independent cohorts); or (3) associations between environmental exposure(s), specific epigenetic changes(s) and adverse phenotypes(s) that were confirmed in a relevant in vivo and/or in vitro system.",1
Studies falling into category 3 provide more comprehensive mechanistic evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity and are shown inTable 1.,1
"Specifically, these studies provide mechanistic associations between bisphenol A (BPA), formaldehyde, arsenic, nickel, or cigarette smoke, epigenetic changes and adverse phenotypes, and potential mechanisms of epigenetic toxicity in humans.",1
The smoking evidence is particularly compelling as it has been established by multiple independent groups investigating different epigenetic mechanisms.,1
"In addition, studies within categories 1 and 2 may also enable the identification of markers and/or mechanisms of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity through a weight of evidence approach (e.g.",1
"the same association(s) reported in multiple independent cohorts or multiple association(s) that contribute to the same biological pathway), and are, therefore, included in Supplementary Table 2.",1
Current evidence for putative environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity in human epidemiological cohorts.,1
(2014)\nOnly studies that measured both adverse phenotypes and associated epigenetic changes in response to an environmental exposure were reviewed.,1
"All the studies shown here demonstrated associations among environmental exposure(s), specific epigenetic changes(s) and adverse phenotypes(s) that were confirmed in a relevant in vivo and/or in vitro system.",1
"Furthermore, while human epidemiological cohort studies can demonstrate association, they do not prove causality.",1
"They are also complicated by the fact that the biological material under study, often blood cells, is not from the target organ/tissue.",1
"Interpretation of the findings with respect to mechanistic connections between environmental factors, epigenetic changes and adverse effects in the target organ/tissue can therefore be challenging.",1
"However, as stated above, all 10 of the studies shown inTable 1further confirmed identified associations between environmental exposures, specific epigenetic changes and adverse phenotypes in a relevant in vivo and/or in vitro system; and seven of the 10 studies either directly sampled the target tissue or validated the same change in the blood and target tissue of an appropriate in vivo model.",1
"As such, these studies are of greater mechanistic relevance, and provide more comprehensive evidence for putative causal relationships.",1
Rodent models\nThe deleterious effects of exposures to environmental factors in human cohorts have stimulated investigations of environmentally induced toxicity in rodent models.,1
"In the late 1990s/early 2000s, these studies began to associate adverse phenotypes resulting from environmental exposures with epigenetic mechanisms (Issa et\xa0al.1996; Tao et\xa0al.1998,1999; Choi et\xa0al.1999; Bielawski et\xa0al.2002; Govindarajan et\xa0al.2002; Chen et\xa0al.2004; Marwick et\xa0al.2004; Pulling et\xa0al.2004; Vuillemenot et\xa0al.2004; Wu et\xa0al.2004).",1
"demonstrated that in utero exposure to the environmental chemical vinclozolin (a fungicide used in the wine industry) reduced sperm quantity, quality and thus male fertility with a >90% penetrance through multiple generations (to at least the F4generation).",1
"The effect appeared to be transmitted through the male germ line, with altered DNA methylation patterns detected in the testes of the F1generation and the sperm of the F2and F3generations.",1
This was the first study to show phenotypic and epigenetic changes in generations not directly exposed to the original stimulus.,1
"As expected, this study generated some controversy, particularly when subsequent groups failed to reproduce the same results (Gray & Furr2008; Schneider et\xa0al.2008; Inawaka et\xa0al.2009; Schneider et\xa0al.2013).",1
These disparities may have been due to the use of different routes of administration and variations in rat strains/stocks.,1
"Nevertheless, over the ensuing decade the hundreds of subsequent studies have provided more evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity.",1
"We identified 147 rodent studies within PubMed (up to 7 March 2016) demonstrating both adverse phenotype(s) (such as reduced fertility, reproductive, developmental or other organ-specific abnormalities, or adult onset diseases (cancer, diabetes, obesity or immune disorders)) and epigenetic change(s) (histone modification, DNA methylation, epigenetic machinery or miRNAs) following exposure to environmental factor(s) (including chemicals, radiation or lifestyle factors (alcohol, nutrition, or smoking)) at various stages of development (pre-conception, in utero , neonatal, lactation, childhood, adolescence and adulthood).",1
"These studies can be ranked into categories that demonstrate (1) environmentally induced adverse phenotype(s) and global epigenetic change(s); (2) environmentally induced adverse phenotype(s) and specific epigenetic change(s) (including further subcategories, such as dose- and/or time-dependent changes, single changes within relevant biological pathways, multiple changes within the same biological pathway, correlation of changes with gene expression at mRNA and/or protein level, use of additional mechanistically relevant controls, robust statistical analysis); (3) environmentally induced adverse phenotype(s) and specific epigenetic change(s) that were reversed by an inhibitor/treatment, absent in a knock out/down model, and/or mechanistically linked in a relevant in vitro system; or (4) the same environmentally induced adverse phenotype(s) and specific epigenetic change(s) in both rodent model(s) and human cohort(s).",1
Studies falling into categories 3 and/or 4 provide more comprehensive mechanistic evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity and are shown inTable 2.,1
"In total, 18 of the 40 studies shown inTable 2validated loss of both epigenetic change(s) and adverse effect(s) following appropriate inhibition, treatment or knock out/down; thereby demonstrating a definitive causal link between exposure (largely high dose) to BPA, formaldehyde, cadmium, methylmercury, 2,3,7,8-tetra-chloro-dibenzo- p -dioxin (TCDD), urethane, vinyl carbamate, alcohol, caffeine, overnutrition, cigarette smoke, nicotine or 4-(methyl-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), epigenetic changes and adverse phenotypes.",1
"While the remaining studies do not necessarily demonstrate causality, they do provide additional mechanistic associations between exposure (again largely high dose) to BPA, formaldehyde, nickel, phthalates, TCDD, alcohol, undernutrition, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenyl-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), peanut, cigarette smoke, nicotine or NKK, epigenetic changes and adverse phenotypes.",1
"The BPA, TCDD, alcohol and smoking-related evidence is particularly compelling as it has been established by multiple independent groups investigating different epigenetic mechanisms.",1
"In addition, studies within categories 1 and 2 may also enable identification of markers and/or mechanisms of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity through a weight of evidence approach (e.g.",1
"the same epigenetic change(s) reported in multiple independent studies or multiple epigenetic changes that contribute to the same biological pathway), and, therefore, are included in Supplementary Table 3.",1
"While much of the work to date has focused on rodent models, there is also some evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity in other mammalian species, including sheep and monkeys (Wu et\xa0al.2008; Begum et\xa0al.2013; Lie et\xa0al.2014a,2014b).",1
Current evidence for putative environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity in rodent models.,1
(2010)*/‡\nOnly studies assessing both adverse phenotypes and associated epigenetic changes in response to an environmental exposure were reviewed.,1
"*Studies demonstrating environmentally-induced adverse phenotype(s) and specific epigenetic change(s) that were reversed by an inhibitor/treatment, absent in a knock out/down model, and/or mechanistically linked in a relevant in vitro system.",1
"†Studies validating loss of both epigenetic change(s) and adverse effect(s) following appropriate inhibition, treatment or knock out/down.",1
‡Studies demonstrating the same environmentally induced adverse phenotype(s) and specific epigenetic change(s) in both animal model(s) and human cohort(s).,1
¶Studies in which environmentally induced adverse phenotype(s) and epigenetic change(s) were reported in separate publications but were performed within the same experimental animals.,1
"Other exposures of environmental origin that have been extensively investigated in both human cohorts and rodent models include stress, recreational drugs, maternal immune activation/infection and parental age.",1
"While this large body of work also provides some comprehensive evidence for, and specific mechanisms of, epigenetic toxicity, it was considered outside the scope of this review.",1
"Likewise, pharmaceutical drug-induced epigenetic toxicity in human cohorts and rodent models has also been reported.",1
"However, such drugs are not environmental factors and so were not considered any further.",1
"Moreover, there were additional studies that have investigated environmentally induced epigenetic changes without simultaneously assessing any phenotypic/toxicological endpoints and/or focused on acute exposures (less than 24\u2009h).",1
"While such studies are more difficult to interpret with respect to epigenetic toxicity (and so were not included in this review), they may still provide useful mechanistic data.",1
It is important to note that not all environmentally induced adverse phenotypes have been associated with epigenetic changes.,1
"Indeed, 18 human cohort and 20 rodent studies within PubMed reported a lack of epigenetically related toxicity (Supplementary Table 4).",1
"These studies do not necessarily rule out an epigenetic mechanism of toxicity per se , but they do exclude a link between the specific epigenetic, exposure and/or adverse endpoints/markers investigated.",1
The literature also contains many in vitro studies investigating the role of specific epigenetic mechanisms in adverse outcomes induced by environmental exposures.,1
"In addition, concurrent in vivo and in vitro studies have improved our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the mammalian life cycle, including recent insights into early human development (Laird2013; Slieker et\xa0al.2015; Surani2015; Williams et\xa0al.2015), and epigenetic inheritance in simpler model systems such as Caenorhabditis elegans , Drosophilamelanogaster and Daniorerio (zebrafish) (Padilla et\xa0al.2014; Somer & Thummel2014; Williams et\xa0al.2014).",1
"Thus, although comparison and integration of these different human cohort, animal, and in vitro studies is complicated by the different doses, routes of administration, timings and lengths of exposures, the various strains, species, cell types or statistical methods used, and/or the specific adverse outcome(s) or marker(s) selected, the current evidence demonstrates a mechanistic association between specific environmental exposures, epigenetic changes and adverse health outcomes in human epidemiological cohorts and model systems.",1
More studies that incorporate some form of inhibition/treatment/cessation into the experimental design are vital for establishing whether or not an exposure truly represents an epigenetic toxicant.,1
"Although potentially complex, the use of a systems biology approach, incorporating genome-wide analysis at multiple levels (histone code, methylome, non-coding RNA expression, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome) would provide comprehensive analysis of epigenetic changes and associated phenotypic outcomes.",1
Subsequent identification of human relevant mechanisms of epigenetic toxicity can then be further validated as appropriate in smaller more focused studies.,1
The challenge now is to fully identify and investigate the specific functional epigenetic mechanisms and biological pathways relevant to humans so that the risk(s) of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity to public health can be properly assessed and addressed.,1
Research considerations for public health\nThere is no doubt that humans are exposed to a range of environmental factors during everyday life.,1
"However, to determine whether, or not, environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity is a real concern for public health there are a number of important considerations.",1
Mechanisms and model systems\nThe nature of the research means that studies in humans are mainly restricted to epidemiological cohorts.,1
These cohorts often have limited availability of appropriate biosample at appropriate collection windows (Bakulski & Fallin2014).,1
"Ex vivo or in vitro experiments on human embryonic tissue and cells are quite rightly restricted by ethics, and can only model a small part of the in vivo situation.",1
"Thus, the majority of whole system studies have been performed in animal models, predominantly rodents.",1
"While the rodent and human life cycles share many commonalities they do exhibit subtle differences, both with each other and other mammalian species (Kristensen et\xa0al.2013; Laird2013; Leitch et\xa0al.2013; Surani2015).",1
Such differences are of critical importance when considering mechanistic relevance to humans.,1
"Nevertheless, such work provides valuable data.",1
"The key is integrating and interpreting it correctly, in terms of differences/similarities at both the system ( in vitro versus in vivo ) and species (human versus non-human) levels.",1
"It is important to continue supplementing non-human models with human-derived data, incorporating new technologies to maximize data collection, and updating and re-evaluating current conclusions as novel information becomes available.",1
Priority questions: What are the detailed mechanism(s) that link a particular exposure to a specific adverse effect?,1
Do these mechanism(s) function in humans?,1
What are the potential human disease outcome(s)?,1
"Dose, route, metabolism, timing and mixtures of exposure\nWhether, or not, an environmental exposure elicits a response depends on a range of interacting variables, including dose, route of administration, metabolism and additional/pre-existing exposures (mixtures).",1
"Much of the animal studies to date on environmental chemicals have involved administration of high doses, many orders of magnitude above likely exposures in real human populations.",1
"Similarly, the first animal study to demonstrate that an in utero exposure could induce adverse phenotypes in subsequent generations administered the environmental chemical vinclozolin via the intraperitoneal route (Anway et\xa0al.2005).",1
"Not only is it unlikely that a human would receive this, or any, environmental exposure via the same route of administration, but also the way in which an exposure is administered determines its overall effect.",1
"Indeed, oral administration of vinclozolin to pregnant females (the likely route of administration for humans given that vinclozolin is a fungicide used in the wine industry) failed to induce any adverse phenotypes in subsequent generations (Schneider et\xa0al.2008).",1
"Thus, while it is important to fully characterize the hazard, further studies at doses and routes of administration similar to those found in humans are necessary for determining relevance to public health.",1
"It is worth noting, however, that establishing the actual level of human exposure to a particular factor and mimicking it in experimental models is not always easy.",1
Metabolism is another major factor that can determine the overall effect of an environmental exposure.,1
"Thus, metabolism of the parent environmental compound can vary greatly between models, resulting in the production of different types and levels of metabolites.",1
"It is, therefore, important to assess if the model system being used accurately replicates the in vivo human metabolic environment, and if not to conduct further studies using any additional appropriate metabolites.",1
The timing of an environmental exposure can also be a major contributing factor to the significance of the overall outcome.,1
"As discussed earlier, some life stages may be more susceptible than others to a particular exposure.",1
There was the assumption that in utero exposure represents the most vulnerable period in an individual’s life with respect to their future development.,1
"However, it is now becoming clear that pre-conception and postnatal exposures can also be detrimental to future health across multiple generations.",1
Multiple exposures at multiple life stages could be additive and/or cumulative.,1
"While a particular low-level exposure may have no adverse effects, multiple low-level exposures over multiple stages of life may induce adverse phenotypes.",1
"Thus, once individual exposures have been characterized, it may also be relevant to assess the effect of (1) mixtures of environmental exposures, (2) multiple lifetime exposures of single environmental exposures, and (3) multiple lifetime exposures of mixtures of environmental exposures.",1
"Priority questions : What dose(s) via what route(s) of administration are human populations actually exposed to, and what metabolite(s) are formed?",1
Do low-level exposures induce epigenetic toxicity?,1
Is any part of the life cycle particularly more sensitive to an exposure than others?,1
Are multiple exposures additive and/or cumulative?,1
Human variability\nIt is known that different strains of laboratory animals can respond very differently to the same environmental exposure.,1
Such differences are largely driven by diverse genetic backgrounds.,1
"Individual humans demonstrate substantial genetic differences and so an individual’s underlying genetics could have a huge effect on his/her susceptibility to a particular environmental exposure, depending on his/her metabolism, adaptability, gender, age, previous exposures, etc.",1
"Thus, not all humans will respond to an environmental exposure in the same way.",1
"Indeed, there are many examples in the literature of how single polymorphisms (SNPs) can affect the response of individuals and populations to different environmental exposures.",1
These include not only mutations that alter the function of gene products but also those that lead to changes in DNA methylation or miRNA binding sites.,1
Priority question : How can we identify particularly susceptible individuals or populations?,1
"This view of epigenetically mediated phenotypic plasticity falls into the realms of Lamarckian inheritance, the idea that an organism can pass on acquired characteristics to future offspring.",1
"The benefits of such inheritance are obvious and even Darwin himself proposed a hypothetical mechanism for the transmission of somatic tissue characteristics via the germ cells to subsequent generations, which he termed pangenesis (Darwin1868).",1
"Indeed, not all environmentally induced epigenetic changes have proved detrimental.",1
(2009) reported that calorie restriction during adolescence and young adulthood as a result of the Dutch Hunger Winter was associated with altered DNA methylation and reduced risk of colorectal cancer in later life.,1
(2015) described a protective effect of early ( in utero through lactation) exposure to dietary omega-3 fatty acids on neuroplasticity in rats that involved specific changes in DNA methylation.,1
Such benefits are not just limited to nutrition; advantageous chemically induced epigenetic changes have also been reported.,1
(2012) demonstrated a beneficial heritable histone modification-mediated reprograming of hepatic wound healing in male rats that reduced fibrotic scarring in the subsequent offspring of rats treated with the hepatotoxin carbon tetrachloride.,1
"In addition, it is possible to have adverse outcomes that are reversible.",1
"(2013) provided epidemiological data to support the benefits of smoking cessation, with DNA methylation-related colon cancer risk reverting back to that of non-smokers within 10 years of cessation.",1
"Thus, the reversibility of environmentally induced changes is also critically important when determining the true potential adversity of an environmental exposure.",1
"Such findings, both positive and negative, have been incorporated into UK governmental advice and recommendations (Boyd et\xa0al.2013).",1
"Furthermore, epigenetic changes may themselves have no consequences on gene expression (as demonstrated in a recent in vitro study by Ramos et\xa0al.",1
"Thus, environmentally induced epigenetic changes may not always be mechanistically involved in adverse effects; instead, they may act as markers of past exposures (Bakulski & Fallin2014), or represent adaptations involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis.",1
Such changes may still prove useful for regulatory purposes and also do not rule out the possibility of later onset effects.,1
"For example, robust epigenetic changes induced by environmental exposures in the absence of a phenotypic consequence essentially become the ‘new normal’ epigenome, which could have greater susceptibility to disease development and/or future exposures (as demonstrated in two in vivo rat models (Greathouse et\xa0al.2012; Wong et\xa0al.2015)).",1
Characterizing normal variation within the epigenome between non-disease states would provide valuable data to begin establishing limits of epignetic change above which cellular homeostasis fails and epigenetic toxicity is induced.,1
The considerable inter- and intra-human/mammalian variation combined with the vast number of potential epigenetic changes make this a very challenging task.,1
"However, defining the limits of normal variation for specific epigenetic changes of relevance would be a sensible and pragmatic starting point.",1
Priority questions : What is the ‘normal’ epigenome?,1
What are the real short- and/or long-term consequence(s) of environmentally induced epigenetic change(s)?,1
Implications for regulatory toxicology and intervention\nAll the previous considerations are vital for effective regulatory toxicology and potential intervention.,1
"A robust, dose-dependent, causal relationship among a specific environmental exposure, an epigenetic change and an adverse public health outcome is required to classify a chemical as an epigenetic toxicant.",1
"While a similar robust, dose-dependent relationship is also crucial to facilitate the development of testing methods for hazard assessment, relevant environmental regulation and/or appropriate medical intervention, establishing causality is not necessarily essential.",1
"Epigenetic changes that act as markers of exposure and/or predictors of future toxicity, but do not in themselves directly induce an adverse effect, may also be useful in risk assessment and intervention.",1
As yet there is no precedent for epigenetically mediated toxicity in chemical regulation.,1
"However, environmental exposures during critical windows of human development and subsequent non-genotoxic/epigenetic changes that may lead to later life adverse health outcomes (such as obesity, diabetes and cancer) across multiple generations continues to be of high concern for all the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries, the International Agency on Research for Cancer (IARC) and the European Commission (EFSA2013; Greally & Jacobs2013; Herceg et\xa0al.2013; OECD2014).",1
Epigenetics thus offers an opportunity for improved chemical regulation and public health protection.,1
"For example, epigenetic changes have the potential to provide (1) more sensitive/earlier end points of toxicity within existing regulatory test guidelines (TGs), (2) novel markers of exposure/predictors of future toxicity for the development of in vitro chemical screening assays and (3) novel end points of toxicities for which we are currently rarely able to conduct definitive regulatory testing due to animal welfare, cost and time considerations (such as non-genotoxic carcinogens, multigenerational toxicity and chronic low-dose exposures that impact health in later life).",1
"As such, epigenetics is high on the agenda of the OECD expert working group on an integrated approach to testing and assessment (IATA) for non-genotoxic carcinogens (NGTxC) and the OECD endocrine disrupters testing and assessment advisory group (EDTA AG) (Greally & Jacobs2013; Jacobs et\xa0al.2015).",1
"The interest of OECD member countries in epigenetics within the former expert group is particularly strong, where epigenetic mechanisms are playing a pivotal role in the development of tools for improved chemical safety assessment (Jacobs et\xa0al.2015).",1
"Thus, the incorporation of epigenetics within chemical regulation could ultimately reduce animal usage and the time and cost of chemical research and development, while simultaneously improving the protection of public health worldwide.",1
"The current body of evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity is predominantly a collection of human epidemiological data and exploratory in vivo high (often single) dose range studies, performed, not for regulatory purposes, but to investigate the theoretical potential and putative mechanisms of epigenetic toxicity in biological systems.",1
"Nevertheless, such studies have helped to identify putative markers and assays that may be useful for biomonitoring such exposures and toxicities, and testing the epigenetic toxicity potential of environmental exposures, respectively.",1
Those that may be of particular interest for development into regulatory strategies/procedures are presented inTables 1and2.,1
"A number of reporter mouse models, including the Agouti Avy , CabpIAP and AuxinFu , have also been used to investigate environmentally induced epigenetic changes in in vivo exploratory research (Dolinoy et\xa0al.2007; Waterland et\xa0al.2006; Rosenfeld2010).",1
The Avy model in particular has been put forward as a potential epigenetic toxicological tool (Dolinoy2008; Rosenfeld2010; Faulk et\xa0al.2013).,1
"However, the suitability of the Avy mouse as a true reporter model has since been questioned following both lack of reproducibility (Rosenfeld et\xa0al.2013), and the suggestion that it may possess a “thrifty” genotype, naturally predisposing offspring to a metabolic syndrome when food is plentiful, thus confounding results following environmental exposures (Greally & Jacobs2013).",1
"The AxinFu mouse may, therefore, represent a more promising reporter model in the development of regulatory toxicological assays for potential environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity.",1
"In addition, current OECD human health-related TGs have the potential for adaptation to incorporate adverse epigenetic endpoints (Greally & Jacobs2013).",1
"Inclusion of such endpoints as non-compulsory measurements would (1) encourage better use of existing studies by adding a valuable non-genotoxic/epigenetic component that is not currently included, (2) provide an extensive sample resource and (3) initiate the collection of epigenetic data in a regulatory context.",1
This would begin to address regulatory concerns and help to develop formal epigenetically relevant toxicity TGs.,1
Such an approach would also respect the 3Rs.,1
"An overview of the relevant TGs that could be explored for adaptation (updated from Greally & Jacobs2013), is provided inTable 3.",1
These include not only the in vitro endocrine TGs and in vivo reproductive and developmental TGs (Greally & Jacobs2013) but also a newly revised genotoxicity TG (TG 483) where spermatogonal samples could be further utilized for RNA analyzes (Linschooten et\xa0al.2009; Marczylo et\xa0al.2012; Metzler-Guillemain et\xa0al.2015).,1
"The potential for such adaptations is already acknowledged at the OECD, but more applied development of key markers and subsequent validation work is needed to formally incorporate epigenetic endpoints into TGs.",1
Similar discussions on the incorporation of epigenetic toxicity into the regulatory framework are also a current focus of industry supported workshops (van Ravenzwaay et\xa0al.2014; ECETOC2016; Miousse et\xa0al.2015).,1
"Current OECD human health related TGs that have the potential for adaptation to include epigenetic endpoints.Type of studyTGsDescriptionGeneral exposure studiesTG 451Carcinogenicity studies\xa0TG 452Chronic toxicity studies\xa0TG 453Combined chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity studiesPost-mitotic cell studiesTG 424Neurotoxicity study in rodentsPrenatal effectsTG 414Prenatal development toxicity study\xa0TG 426Developmental neurotoxicity studyReproductive effectsTGs 415, 416One- and two-generation reproduction toxicity\xa0TG 421(Revised) Reproduction/developmental toxicity screening test\xa0TG 422(Revised) Combined repeated dose toxicity study with the reproduction/developmental toxicity screening test\xa0TG 443Extended one-generation reproductive toxicity studyGenotoxicity testsTG 483(Revised 2015) Mammalian spermatogonial chromosome aberration testAlternative models integrating multiple \u2003mechanisms of toxicityTG 236 -Zebrafish embryo epigenetic toxicity assay Xenopus Embryo Thyroid Assay (XETA Assay) (in validation)\nUpdated from Greally and Jacobs (2013).",1
"When considering temporal aspects to reproductive, developmental and endocrine disrupting effects, the TGs currently in use may not incorporate either the most relevant life stage(s), the most sensitive endpoints for epigenetic perturbation and/or sufficient duration of observation to detect later-onset effects.",1
"Thus, it is likely that the full spectrum of potential effects will not be identified.",1
"While some tests in the OECD Conceptual Framework do cover exposure during critical periods of development in utero , to date, they may not address effects that might be induced by exposure during neonatal or pubertal development, and/or emerge during later life stages.",1
"For regulatory purposes, there are major limitations to simply extending lifetime rodent studies beyond the standard 2 years to examine later-onset epigenetic adverse outcomes, including financial, ethical and scientific considerations.",1
"In addition to the increased costs and animal welfare issues associated with housing and monitoring up to the natural death of the animals, there is also the confounding factor of increased background pathology with age.",1
"Infectious pathologies and increased incidences of certain tumor types, such as pituitary tumors or lymphomas/leukaemias, are known to occur with increasing age, and the high spontaneous incidences of leukemias/lymphomas and mammary gland tumors in laboratory animals from inbred colonies are known to vary considerably between studies (Innes et\xa0al.1967; Greaves2000).",1
"Thus, an overview of non-neoplastic, pre-neoplastic, neoplastic and benign pathologies within each model system is essential for the accurate interpretation of life-long rodent studies.",1
"Such overviews are, however, rarely included in the relevant literature associated with extended lifetime studies.",1
"Consequently, these studies are rarely considered acceptable to many regulatory authorities and are not specifically requested for ethical reasons, the numbers of animals needed to ensure appropriate statistical power would be both unworkable, and unethical.",1
"There are other more time and financially economical ways in which lifetime, multigenerational and/or transgenerational toxicity could be assessed, for example using zebrafish models, both respecting the 3Rs and satisfying sufficient statistical power.",1
"Already widely used in the pharmaceutical industry for developmental toxicity screening, zebrafish models appear to be a promising alternative to mice.",1
"Furthermore, it is also important to consider the broader repercussions of regulatory toxicology.",1
"Of course, it is vital that any environmental toxicant is carefully regulated or even banned from use.",1
"However, the situation is often not as straightforward as this.",1
"For example, chemicals can have far-reaching benefits to society, from agriculture to medicine and food/product safety to the development of new technologies.",1
Regulations are frequently a fine balance between maximizing the ‘modern life’ benefits of an environmental chemical while minimizing any potential adverse effects.,1
"This is where dose/level of exposure and relevance to humans is crucial, but considerations of alternative replacements are also important.",1
Do we run the risk of banning a chemical that does not demonstrate any epigenetic toxicity at the levels found within the environment or human populations only to replace it with an alternative whose characteristics and potential effects we know even less about?,1
"Surely, it is better for both society and public health to fully assess the potential epigenetic effects of environmental exposures and introduce regulations and TGs based on relevant data and proven mechanisms of toxicity.",1
"Conclusions\nDespite the fact that the seminal work on environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity was published over a decade ago, this area of research largely remains in its infancy, striving to elucidate putative mechanisms of epigenetic toxicity and identify mechanistic associations in human cohorts.",1
"This might well be expected since the fundamental idea that environmental factors can induce phenotypic changes across multiple generations challenges the central dogma of genetic inheritance, moving into what was a controversial area of genetics, but is now better accepted and established, Lamarckism.",1
"While many hundreds of studies have investigated environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity, relatively few (47 to-date) have demonstrated a mechanistic association among specific environmental exposures, epigenetic changes and adverse phenotypes.",1
"Even fewer (18 of the 47 to-date) further established causality, all of which were studies in rodent models.",1
"Moreover, the majority of these 47 studies represent exploratory in vivo high (often single) dose range experiments, many orders of magnitude above likely human exposures.",1
"Nevertheless, they do set a precedent for the existence of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity, and provide tools for linking environmental exposures to adverse health outcomes.",1
"Thus, although the current literature remains incomplete regarding specific mechanisms of epigenetically mediated environmentally induced toxicity in humans at doses relevant to human exposures, there is sufficient information to perform retrospective epigenetic analysis of existing regulatory studies and identify future research needs.",1
"For example, epigenetic mechanisms and markers identified within the 47 studies highlighted in this review could be further examined and potentially validated in existing regulatory studies.",1
"Improved human exposure data could be collected and used to facilitate the use of more relevant doses, routes of administration, metabolites and mixtures.",1
"Guidelines could be developed for improved molecular ( in vivo , in vitro and epidemiological) and bioinformatic study designs that incorporate suitable new technologies (such as omics platforms) and appropriate inhibitors/treatments/cessations (for exposure/change/effect validation) to definitively identify detailed epigenetic mechanisms that link, or act as markers of, environmental exposures and adverse health outcomes.",1
"Collaboration between scientists from academia, industry, and governmental and regulatory bodies will promote further research within a regulatory context, and drive the development and implementation of epigenetically relevant integrated testing strategies or policies for the continued protection of public health.",1
"Recurrent acral angioosteoma cutis in a pregnant patient\n\nIntroduction\nGooge et\xa0al in 2006 first described 11 cases of acral angioosteoma cutis (AAOC), characterized by benign vascular and osseous lesions on acral skin.1Since then, there have been only 3 additional cases reported.2,3,4This friable erythematous exophytic papule has clinical resemblance to pyogenic granuloma (PG) but has distinct histologic features.",1
"Therefore, it is crucial for dermatologists to be aware of this condition, as it is rare and likely often misdiagnosed.",1
"To our knowledge, this case is the first report of AAOC in pregnancy.",1
"In addition to clinical similarity, AAOC could be misdiagnosed as PG with ossification because of the vascular and bony growth on histology.",1
"Of 4 reports of PG with ossification, only one commented on the lobular vascularity.5,6,7,8Kim et\xa0al5describes PG with ossification as lobular proliferation of capillaries with spicules of spongy bone with osteocytelike and osteoblastlike cells.",1
The pathogenesis of AAOC remains unclear.,1
Burgdorf and Nasemann6proposed 2 theories of cutaneous ossification.,1
One notion is that primitive mesenchymal cells differentiate into normal osteoblasts in the wrong location.,1
The other theory is that undifferentiated mesenchymal cells undergo metaplastic differentiation in the setting of inflammation or hypoxia.,1
"In previous case reports, the investigators believed that the vascular proliferation in both\xa0AAOC and PG were induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).2,3,4Endothelial cells produce signals such as bone morphogenic protein (BMP) to induce metaplastic differentiation and ectopic bone formation.9Osteoblasts are also\xa0responsible for production of VEGF.10The combination of VEGF and hypoxia induce BMP expression.9Together, VEGF and BMP are the most likely factors that induce vascular proliferation and bone formation in AAOC.",1
"Because AAOC might be misdiagnosed as PG or other benign cutaneous neoplasm, it may not be rare\xa0but rather underreported.",1
"With the possible driving factors of VEGF and BMP, this lesion is benign and can recur after excision.",1
Dermatologists should be aware of the distinguishing features of\xa0scattered bone formation and diffuse capillary proliferation of AAOC rather than the lobular aggregates in PG.,1
Long-Term Effects of Prenatal Exposure to Undernutrition on Cannabinoid Receptor-Related Behaviors: Sex and Tissue-Specific Alterations in the mRNA Expression of Cannabinoid Receptors and Lipid Metabolic Regulators\n\nAbstract\nMaternal malnutrition causes long-lasting alterations in feeding behavior and energy homeostasis in offspring.,1
"It is still unknown whether both, the endocannabinoid (eCB) machinery and the lipid metabolism are implicated in long-term adaptive responses to fetal reprogramming caused by maternal undernutrition.",1
"We investigated the long-term effects of maternal exposure to a 20% standard diet restriction during preconceptional and gestational periods on the metabolically-relevant tissues hypothalamus, liver, and perirenal fat (PAT) of male and female offspring at adulthood.",1
"Our results suggest that the long-lasting adaptive responses to maternal caloric restriction affected cannabinoid-regulated mechanisms involved in feeding behavior, adipose β-oxidation, and hepatic lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis in a sex-dependent manner.",1
"Introduction\nAlthough, overnutrition is an important life style factor for the development of metabolic syndrome, obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus (Alberti et al.,2009), maternal undernutrition resulting in early life nutritional unbalance can be also related to the onset of long-term metabolic alterations observed later in life.",1
"Importantly, this hypothesis supports that fetal undernutrition can represent the origin of cardiovascular disease, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia at adulthood (Barker and Osmond,1988; Barker et al.,1989,1993).",1
"The epidemiological data from the Dutch Famine have showed that people whose mothers were exposed to undernutrition in early gestation developed more metabolic abnormalities than people exposed in other pregnancy stages (Roseboom et al.,2006).",1
"Currently, maternal undernutrition is a problem not exclusive of developing countries.",1
"The pressure to thinness in western societies associated to a higher prevalence of women with a past of eating disorders or a worry in excess about body changing during pregnancy and postpartum have raised the risk for giving birth underweight babies (Easter et al.,2013; Linna et al.,2014).",1
"However, we should not discard a predictive marker of impaired fetal nutrition in those cases with absence of low birth weight.",1
"Experiments with animals models have succeeded in simulate metabolic alterations of undernutrition during gestational periods in humans, particularly by the implementation of a moderate or severe calorie restricted diets (Desai et al.,2005; García et al.,2010; Palou et al.,2010; Suzuki et al.,2010; Lukaszewski et al.,2011).",1
"Consequently, the exposure to a moderate or severe restricted diet during pregnancy has been associated to features of metabolic syndrome in adult offspring such as higher adiposity (Yura et al.,2005; Suzuki et al.,2010; Lukaszewski et al.,2011), alterations in glucose metabolism (Jimenez-Chillaron et al.,2005; Breton et al.,2009; Theys et al.,2011), or alterations in the lipid plasmatic profile (Desai et al.,2005,2007a; Palou et al.,2010,2012).",1
"Moreover, these metabolic alterations after a maternal calorie restricted diet have been found associated to abnormalities in feeding behavior such as hyperphagia (Vickers et al.,2000; Breton et al.,2009; Manuel-Apolinar et al.,2014) or high preference for high-fat diet (Palou et al.,2010; Lukaszewski et al.,2011).",1
"Some studies have also noticed that the metabolic profile exhibited by offspring depends on the sex (Desai et al.,2007a; Palou et al.,2010; Suzuki et al.,2010).",1
"Several biologic mechanisms underlying the nutritional programming, which become altered after the exposure to a maternal restricted diet during pregnancy, have been identified.",1
"Interestingly, recent studies have documented epigenetic modifications or affectation of adrenocortical growth in offspring after maternal dietary restriction around the time of conception (Nicholas et al.,2013; Zhang et al.,2013), pointing out the importance of the periconceptional window in the metabolic programming.",1
"The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is also implicated in metabolic and behavioral mechanisms involved in fetal programming such as leptin signaling (Di Marzo et al.,2001) or dopaminergic system (Melis et al.,2004).",1
"Long-term effects of ECS activation could finally increase the risk from suffering metabolic diseases that lead to obesity and metabolic syndrome (Tibirica,2010; Cristino et al.,2014).",1
"Additionally, it has been revealed that some ECS components are sensible to dietary conditions.",1
"As the main endogenous agonists (anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol) of the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 are derivatives of fatty acids, it has been demonstrated that the lipid profile of the diet could modify the endocannabinoid levels (Artmann et al.,2008) in some tissues, including the early developing brain (Berger et al.,2001).",1
"Consequently, the cannabinoid receptor activity may be modified.",1
"Furthermore, the gene expression of the ECS components could be modified after the exposure to different dietary conditions (Bello et al.,2012).",1
"Taking together, these data suggest that the ECS could play a putative role in nutritional programming and hence in the early origin of metabolic diseases.",1
"Regarding the potential relation between ECS and fetal undernutrition, a few studies have demonstrated that the maternal exposure to a calorie-restricted diet during pregnancy and/or lactation could decrease the hypothalamic endocannabinoids and/or acylethanolamines in offspring (Matias et al.,2003; Ramírez-López et al.,2016).",1
"However, it is unknown whether changes in nutritional programming by maternal diet restriction during fetal development could modify the expression of ECS components later in life and lead to long-lasting impact on energy metabolism and feeding behavior.",1
"Based on these considerations, we aim to focus on the long-term effects on cannabinoid-related behaviors (i.e., cannabinoid receptor antagonist-induced suppression of feeding), and effects on lipid-related metabolic pathways of a maternal exposure to a moderate caloric restriction during the preconceptional and gestational period.",1
"Additionally, it was assessed the spontaneous and compulsive feeding behavior, growing parameters, leptin, plasma metabolites, and adiposity after weaning (adolescence and adulthood).",1
We hypothesize that the maternal exposure to a moderate calorie-restricted diet could alter the energy homeostasis regulated by the ECS and could re-program fatty-acid metabolism later in life in a sex-specific manner.,1
We also proposed that these putative alterations could increase the vulnerability to develop metabolic diseases in adulthood.,1
"In order to minimize the estrous cycle-related variability, the female rats were closely housed in adjacent cages and randomly distributed among the different experimental groups (McClintock,1978,1984).",1

"Discussion\nThis study demonstrates that the maternal exposure to a moderate (20%) caloric restriction (undernutrition) during preconceptional (2 weeks) and gestational (up 2 days before birth) periods produced long-term effects on body weight, feeding behavior and gene expression of key components of the ECS (receptors and enzymes) in a sex-dependent manner.",1
"These effects extended to lipid and cholesterol metabolic pathways, suggesting the existence of a complex pattern alterations derived of adaptation to maternal malnutrition.",1
A moderate maternal caloric restriction produces sex-dimorphic effects in feeding and body weight gain only after weaning\nThe dams exposed to undernutrition during prenatal stages exhibited a reduction in their body weight gain and caloric intake during gestation that contrasts with the increase in their body weight during lactation with normal nutrition.,1
"This finding is in agreement with previous studies in humans, which demonstrated that offspring exposed to famine or hyperemesis gravidarum in the first part of pregnancy did not show lower birth weight (Roseboom et al.,2006; Grooten et al.,2015).",1
"Similarly, animal studies documented normoweight at birth when the early pregnancy was conducted under caloric restriction (Cleal et al.,2007; Palou et al.,2010; Poore et al.,2010).",1
"In contrast, a lower weight at birth has been described in several studies when the calorie-restricted diet was prolonged to birth (Desai et al.,2005; Lukaszewski et al.,2011).",1
"An explanation that emerges from these studies is that the putative fetal underweight caused by maternal undernutrition may be recovered in few days of normal nutrition, as was previously suggested (Cleal et al.,2007; Ramírez-López et al.,2016).",1
"Returning to our data, weight recovery in offspring may occur as a result of an accelerated catch-up growth before birth caused by an ad libitum maternal feeding.",1
The differential response to the maternal undernutrition in energy balance is sexual dimorphism dependent during the post-weaning periods.,1
The results indicated that CC male rats showed an increase in body weight and abdominal fat mass that contrasted with a decrease in caloric intake and compulsive feeding during the adolescence and adulthood compared to CC female rats.,1
"As we will discuss below, these sex-differences extend to metabolic pathways under the control of the endogenous cannabinoid system, as previously suggested (Wagner,2016).",1
"Thus, the effects of the maternal caloric restriction on the energy balance of male and female offspring should be interpreted based on their sex-dependent basal metabolism.",1
"The increase in body weight of RC male offspring is directly associated with an increase in abdominal fat and, particularly, a higher percentage of perirenal adiposity relative to body weight.",1
"The elevated fat mass and body weight justify the higher levels of triglycerides, LDL, VLDL, bilirubin, and the adipocytes-specific satiety hormone leptin in plasma.",1
"In contrast, the female offspring from calorie-restricted dams did not show changes in body weight and adiposity, but exhibited higher levels of LDL and glucose in plasma, and a reduction in chocolate preference at adolescence and total caloric intake at adulthood.",1
"The lower compulsive feeding in RC females can be associated with the hyperglycemia via a hypothalamic impairment of glucose-sensing to control hunger and satiety (Routh et al.,2014).",1
Previous researches have demonstrated metabolic alterations after undernutrition in a sex-dependent manner.,1
"Increased adiposity, lipid profile, glycemia, and leptinemia in male offspring have been reported after the exposure to a moderate undernutrition at different pregnancy periods (Desai et al.,2007a; Palou et al.,2010).",1
"Concerning the potential explanations of the differential phenotypic features between males and females, the leptin sensibility can play an important role.",1
"Indeed, the higher leptin levels in plasma without reduction in food intake suggest leptin resistance and, therefore, an altered leptin signaling (Friedman and Halaas,1998).",1
"A putative decrease in hypothalamic sensitivity to leptin may result in an inability to detect satiety despite the fat stores, which finally develop to obesity (Sasaki,2015).",1
"The higher leptin sensitivity described in females than in males has been associated with gonadal hormones (Clegg et al.,2003,2006) and may explain in part the higher levels of leptin found in the plasma of male offspring.",1
"Furthermore, the placenta responses to maternal diet in a sex-specific manner (Tarrade et al.,2015), suggesting that the sexual dimorphism in adiposity-relevant parameters could be present at very early stages.",1
"Effects of moderate maternal caloric restriction on feeding behavior\nThis differential sex effect on body weight after maternal caloric restriction was in agreement with data from previous studies (Palou et al.,2010).",1
"The obvious explanations to the higher body weight found in RC males after weaning could be as a consequence of an increased food intake, decreased energy expenditure or higher metabolic efficiency.",1
"Concerning hyperphagia, several studies have reported this feeding alteration after the exposure to undernutrition in critical windows of development (Vickers et al.,2000; Desai et al.,2005; Breton et al.,2009; Palou et al.,2010; Lukaszewski et al.,2011; Manuel-Apolinar et al.,2014), so it has been proposed as an important contributor of the excessive body weight.",1
"Intriguingly, our data indicated that either male or female offspring from calorie-restricted dams did not display higher caloric intake after weaning, despite of the fact that the males exhibited greater body weight at adulthood.",1
"Indeed, discrepancies were also found in the literature.",1
"For instance, it has been also documented excessive body weight in absence of higher food intake (Yura et al.,2005; Sebert et al.,2009; Theys et al.,2011).",1
"Evidence in some studies pointed out that hyperphagia could be a transitory effect that disappears when the underweighted animals after maternal undernutrition were able to reach the weight as controls (Vickers et al.,2000; Lukaszewski et al.,2011).",1
"So, hyperphagia could be a compensatory effect after prolonged underweight.",1
"In this context, it is plausible in our experimental model that RC offspring did not showed underweight and, therefore, hyperphagia in any stage.",1
"It is important to note that when caloric intake is adjusted to body weight the effect of maternal caloric restriction on appetite seems more discrete (Lagisz et al.,2014).",1
One possibility that emerges from our data is that male offspring can increase their body weight by either a reduction of energy expenditure or higher metabolism efficiency.,1
"This fact might be a consequence of the inadequate fetal programming of metabolic systems involved in energy homeostasis (Hales and Barker,2001; Vaag et al.,2012).",1
"The analysis of the cannabinoid-regulated metabolism, such as the expression of key enzymes, receptors and regulators of the lipid and cholesterol metabolism, could provide some clues to what may be happening.",1
"The effect observed in the RC offspring were contrary to those from previous studies, which described either, an increased preference for higher caloric diets after exposure to caloric restriction during pregnancy (Lussana et al.,2008; Palou et al.,2010) or hyperphagia in animals fed with a high-fat diet (Lukaszewski et al.,2011).",1
Different factors can partially explain the discrepancies found in food preferences.,1
(2010) described a higher preference for a fat-rich liquid diet than a carbohydrate-rich liquid diet in male offspring fed for 1 h after an adaptation period of 8 days (habituation to diet).,1
"However, our data indicated a lower preference for a novel highly-palatable food (chocolate mixture) than the familiar standard diet in RC females when they were exposed for 4 days.",1
"The lower acceptance to novel foods has been found in animals with protein deficiency from early gestational stages (Peregoy et al.,1972; Pettus et al.,1974) and could be associated with abnormal behaviors in adulthood related to anxiety (Peleg-Raibstein et al.,2012).",1
"Regarding the timing of restriction, protein deficiency during early pregnancy induces a less preference to a high-fat diet in the female offspring (Bellinger and Langley-Evans,2005), whereas a high preference was obtained when restriction was applied through other gestational periods (Bellinger et al.,2004; Bellinger and Langley-Evans,2005).",1
"According to our results, a maternal caloric restriction prior to mating could be critical for the less compulsive feeding observed in female offspring.",1
The tendency to lower chocolate preference suggests an increased threshold of the palatability.,1
"Interestingly, the ECS is implicated in the intake of palatable food (DiPatrizio and Simansky,2008) and the perception of sweet taste (Niki et al.,2015).",1
"Interestingly, caloric restriction induced a higher reduction in total intake in the female offspring treated with AM251.",1
"This subtle difference may indicate some alterations in the central rewarding functions of the ECS, as was previously described in animals with reduced preference for highly palatable foods (Brand et al.,2012).",1
Impact of maternal caloric restriction on the expression of the endogenous cannabinoid system in organs related to energy expenditure and metabolism\nThe sex-dependent effects of maternal caloric restriction on feeding behavior and metabolic profile in offspring can be a result of a differential re-programming in energy metabolism.,1
"Moreover, long-lasting changes in the gene expression of components of the ECS, which modulates appetite and energy homeostasis, and other key enzymes and regulators of lipid and cholesterol metabolism, were found in metabolically relevant tissues (liver and PAT) of adult offspring in a sex-dependent manner.",1
"These results likely indicate that the up-expression of the cannabinoid receptors in the hypothalamus at adulthood may result from a lower long-term cannabinoid activity that, in turn, could be produced by lower levels of eCBs and N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) in the hypothalamus of male offspring as was previous described at birth (Ramírez-López et al.,2016).",1
This interpretation also agrees with the down-regulation of the endocannabinoid metabolism in peripheral tissues.,1
"However, the adult female offspring from calorie-restricted dams showed a decreased gene expression of Cnr1 and the eCBs-degrading enzymes Faah and Mgll in liver as well as the NAEs-synthesizing enzyme Napepld in PAT.",1
The prominent down-regulation of the eCBs-degrading enzymes in the liver of RC females may result in a different endocannabinoid signaling than that of RC males.,1
"Higher endocannabinoid levels as a result of a lower expression of the eCBs-degrading enzymes FAAH and MAGL in liver can be associated with alterations in the lipid and cholesterol metabolism (Dinh et al.,2002; Osei-Hyiaman et al.,2005; Di Marzo and MacCarrone,2008), due to the fact that both eCBs anandamide (AEA) and 2-AG can inhibit the gene expression of apolipoprotein A1, the primary protein component of HDL, through the activation of CB1 receptors in hepatocytes (Haas et al.,2012).",1
"Despite of these alterations, in general, the female phenotype seems less severely affected after the exposure to maternal undernutrition in early development.",1
Any explanation for these dimorphisms should be supported by the elevated gene expression of Cnr2 in the liver and PAT of the RC female offspring compared to those of the RC males.,1
"Interestingly, the CB2 receptor activation was associated with anti-obesity effects (Verty et al.,2015) and a decreased risk for cardiovascular diseases.",1
"For instance, the gene deletion of the 2-AG-degrading enzyme Mgll has been linked to attenuation of diet-induced insulin resistance and improvement of atherosclerosis via CB2 activation (Taschler et al.,2011; Vujic et al.,2016).",1
"Taken in account the lower impact of the exposure to undernutrition observed in females in particular, and the lower risk of cardiovascular diseases described in females in general (Blenck et al.,2016), we can speculate that the CB2 receptor up-regulation may play a protective role in adverse metabolic conditions.",1
"The higher gene expression of Cnr1 in the hypothalamus, which was subtly more evident in male than female offspring from caloric-restricted dams, was not so clear in previous studies (Matias et al.,2003).",1
"(2003) demonstrated a decrease in the hypothalamic levels of AEA (confirmed by Ramírez-López et al.,2016) and an absence of significant changes in the gene expression of Cnr1 and Faah in the hypothalamus of weaned pups after a maternal undernutrition throughout the last part of pregnancy and/or lactation.",1
A possible explanation of this discrepancy could be related to the critical consequences of the maternal undernutrition at preconceptional periods.,1
"The up-expression of Cnr1 in the hypothalamus has been associated with the leptin resistance in obesity (Thanos et al.,2008; Cardinal et al.,2012).",1
This fact agrees with the increased body weight and the higher plasma levels of leptin in RC male offspring despite of the absence of hyperphagia or alterations in hypothalamic endocannabinoid machinery.,1
"It was described that long-term undernutrition from early stages lead to higher gene expression of Cnr1 in several brain regions of the leptin-deficient obese Zucker rats (Thanos et al.,2008).",1
"These findings indicate that leptin action and, therefore, the normal function of leptin receptors reduces the endocannabinoid tone and CB1 receptor activity (Di Marzo et al.,2001).",1
"Regarding the absence of hyperphagia, it is important to note that the food intake has been associated with the cannabinoid activation in specific hypothalamic areas (Soria-Gomez et al.,2014).",1
"However, previous studies suggested that specific CB1 receptor deletion in the hypothalamus was able to decrease body weight and increase energy expenditure, but was not accompanied with changes in food intake (Cardinal et al.,2012).",1
"Therefore, an alteration in the hypothalamic levels of endocannabinoids in newborn animals, as was previously described by Ramírez-López et al.",1
"(2016), could impair the sympathetic neurotransmission and hormones involved in energy metabolism (Di Marzo et al.,2001; Keimpema et al.,2013,2014; Cristino et al.,2014).",1
"Thus, the down-expression of the eCBs-degrading enzymes Faah and Mgll in the PAT of RC male offspring is consistent with an obese phenotype, hyperleptinemia, adiposity, and alterations in lipid metabolism in absence of increased food intake, as was previously described in animals with deficiency of FAAH and MAGL (Tourino et al.,2010; Geurts et al.,2015).",1
"In contrast, the decreased gene expression of the 2-AG-synthesizing enzymes Dagl α and Dagl β is opposed to what was previously found in the adipose tissue of obese subjects (Engeli et al.,2014).",1
"Therefore, the down-regulation of the endocannabinoid machinery in the adipose tissue of male offspring at adulthood may result in a putative compensatory effect in order to respond to an unbalanced endocannabinoid tone originated at birth after maternal undernutrition.",1
"The down-expression of all these elements in PAT indicates lower energy expenditure in RC males, which agrees with the increased perirenal adiposity and the higher levels of triglycerides in plasma.",1
"These features were also linked to an impairment of the browning process of the white adipose tissue (Geurts et al.,2015).",1
"Despite we found a decrease in the gene expression of Ppar γ, opposite results after the exposure to undernutrition (Bispham et al.,2005) and similar results after malnutrition during early development have been documented (Ahmad et al.,2013; Reynolds et al.,2014).",1
"Interestingly, the decreased gene expression of Ppar γ has been linked to inflammatory processes associated with obesity and insulin resistance (Odegaard et al.,2007; Reynolds et al.,2014), an issue that enhances the importance of the inflammatory responses in the developmental programming.",1
"As these nuclear receptors has been also linked to the activation of fatty-acid β-oxidation and insulin sensitivity (Auwerx,1999; Minnich et al.,2001), their decreased levels in RC females might be associated to alterations in lipid and glucose metabolism (Liu et al.,2015).",1
"The down-expression of these elements suggests a reduction of fatty-acid and cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver of RC females, which could partially explain the altered levels of the lipid carriers high-density, low-density and very low-density lipoproteins (HDL, LDL, and HLDL) in plasma.",1
"The HDL was 10-fold reduced in the plasma of RC females, which indicates a significant reduction of the outlet rate of fat molecules (cholesterol, phospholipids and triglycerides) from cells.",1
"In contrast, the LDL was two-fold increased in the plasma of RC females, which is strongly associated with artherosclerosis within the artery wall and poses a risk for cardiovascular disease.",1
"Similarly to human cohort studies, our results emphasize the importance of early life programming as the exposure to undernutrition during early development increases the risk from suffering features of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease later in life (Desai et al.,2005,2007b; Jimenez-Chillaron et al.,2005; Yura et al.,2005; Breton et al.,2009; Palou et al.,2010; Suzuki et al.,2010; Lukaszewski et al.,2011; Theys et al.,2011).",1
Sexual dimorphisms: an open question\nA major finding of this study is the appearance of sexual dimorphisms on the effects of maternal caloric restriction in the adult offspring.,1
Differences extend not only to metabolic parameters and gene expression but also to behavioral responses.,1
A major issue in sex differences is the need for control the estrous phase on which the evaluations were performed in order to clarify the impact of sex hormones variations in the female.,1
"Since the number of animals needed to control the three phases of the estrous cycle, including morning to afternoon time variations, was too high to be affordable, we had to use randomly cycling female animals sacrificed only during the morning time.",1
This limitation has to be considered in the interpretation of the data and further research will be addressed to evaluate the reasons for the sex-dimorphic alterations.,1
"However, it is important to note that in the female rat, sex steroids regulate both the expression and function of the endogenous cannabinoid system, so a potential explanation will also involve the impact of malnutrition on this important modulatory system, as it was described previously (Bonnin et al.,1993; Rodríguez de Fonseca et al.,1994).",1
"Conclusion\nAs conclusion, our results demonstrated that the exposure to a moderate maternal restricted diet from the preconceptional period predisposed for the development of features related to the metabolic syndrome, affected subtly the feeding behavior and altered the gene expression of relevant regulators of the lipid and cholesterol metabolism, including the endocannabinoid signaling system, in metabolically-relevant tissues (hypothalamus, liver and PAT) of adult offspring in a sex specific-manner.",1
"Moreover, the outcomes of the present study enhance the importance of the periconceptional period as well as the role of maternal diet in the early life programming, due to the fact that the maternal undernutrition was implemented before mating and offspring were raised in an ad libitum standard feeding.",1
"Importantly, this evidence supports the idea that the contribution of the endocannabinoid system in the early life programming could be critical.",1
Our findings represent an important key point to understand the complexity of the fetal programming process and might be particularly useful in the searching of efficient therapies against a malprogramming.,1
Further studies should be performed to clarify the role of the endocannabinoid system and other homeostatic mechanisms implicated in the process of nutritional programming.,1
"Investigation of the vitamin D nutritional status in women with gestational diabetes mellitus in Beijing\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nVitamin D deficiency is a common issue, which has relation with GDM, during the pregnant period.",1
To study the Vitamin D nutritional status of pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in the middle and late pregnancy and analyze the different sources of Vitamin D intake.,1
The level of 25-hydroxy Vitamin D (25-OH Vit D) and the sources of Vitamin D intake and the frequency of food consumption rich in Vitamin D were investigated.,1
"The diet records showed that the frequencies of consumption of dairy products and eggs among patients were 7.5\u2009±\u20093.8/week and 5.6\u2009±\u20092.2/week, respectively.",1
Conclusion\nMost of the patients took Vitamin D supplements which may help to maintain the nutritional balance of Vitamin D.\n\nBackground\nVitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the gut and maintains adequate serum calcium and phosphate concentrations to ensure normal mineralization of the bone.,1
Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults [1].,1
"Study has shown that exposing edible mushroom to ultraviolet B light could increase its Vitamin D2 content and raise serum 25-OH VitD2 in healthy adults [2,3].",1
Study also has shown that serum 25-OH VitD2 detection rate is less than 5% in China [4].,1
Serum 25-OH Vitamin D level is recognized as the best indicator of Vitamin D status.,1
"Adequate Vitamin D status (>30\xa0nmol/L) significantly promotes calcium absorption and reduces rickets risks, which was deemed as good Vitamin D nutritional status.",1
"Some researchers defined serum 25-OH Vitamin D lower than 50\xa0nmol/L as diagnostic criteria for Vitamin D deficiency, 50–75\xa0nmol/L as inadequate, and higher than 75\xa0nmol/L as adequate [4,6,7].",1
"Previously, ELISA was used to measure serum 25-OH Vitamin D level.",1
"Recently, LC-MS/MS became the gold standard of measuring Vitamin D level due to its ability to differentiate and accurately quantify the two subgroups of 25-OH Vitamin D (25-OH Vitamin D2 and 25-OH Vitamin D3); (2) high specificity, which allows differentiation of the target molecule from other metabolic intermediates, as well as avoiding interference as seen in immunological methods; (3) high sensitivity, which allows detection at ng/mL level.",1
Such method allows nutrition researchers to identify Vitamin D food sources and evaluate dietary pattern.,1
Vitamin D deficiency is closely associated with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM).,1
"Vitamin D is also a potential immunosuppressant, which down-regulates the expression of pro-inflammation markers, such as TNF-α and IL-2, among pregnant women with GDM [8].",1
There is an increased risk of Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy [9].,1
Study has found that the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is 66–96% [7].,1
"Currently, it is recommended to use multiVitamin or calcium supplements containing Vitamin D for women during pregnancy to increase their Vitamin D intake.",1
"The dosage is based on dietary intake recommendations [10,11].",1
It is important to pay attention to Vitamin D nutritional status in GDM pregnancy nutrition management.,1
"Using a new assessment technique, we investigated Vitamin D nutritional status among outpatients with GDM in our hospital, and analyzed Vitamin D sources and its association with dietary pattern.",1
"The serum level of 25-OH Vitamin D2 in the intervention group was 11.61\u2009±\u20096.71 (6.06–24.71) nmol/L, however, the serum 25-OH Vitamin D2 level in the fourteen cases in the control group was too low to be detected with the current technology (Table\xa02).",1
Discussion\nNormal Vitamin D level is one of the nutritional management goals for women with GDM.,1
"Most women (66–96%) in their middle and late pregnancy in Beijing are Vitamin D deficient if diagnosed with the criteria of serum 25-OH Vitamin D level <50\xa0nmol/L (ELISA method), as indicated in two studies from Department of Endocrinology and Department of Laboratory Medicine in Peking Union Medical College Hospital [6].",1
"This is comparable with the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency among the general population in Beijing area (LC-MS method, 11% if diagnosed with serum 25-OH Vitamin D level <25\xa0nmol/L, or 55% if diagnosed with serum 25-OH Vitamin D level between 25 and 50\xa0nmol/L method) [5].",1
"The Vitamin D deficiency level identified in this study was 20.4%, which is lower than those identified in the studies discussed previously.",1
Sunlight exposure time has an important impact on Vitamin D3 level.,1
The seasonal variations of serum 25-OH Vitamin D level detected in these subjects are consistent with natural environmental changes in the area of residence.,1
"Thus, the strength and duration of sunlight exposure become the main factors affecting the Vitamin D level in their bodies.",1
"Besides sunlight exposure, Vitamin D supplementation is also an important factor that affects serum 25-OH Vitamin D level among women with GDM.",1
This study finds that 85.7% of pregnant women received supplements containing Vitamin D. Their serum 25-OH Vitamin D levels were higher than those without supplement use.,1
"In addition, participants with GDM in this study were mostly urban residents with a higher socioeconomic status.",1
"It is noted that the detection rate of serum 25-OH Vitamin D2 in the study is 19.4%, higher than the usual 5% in the general population [3].",1
"However, only four out of nineteen participants with supplement use who was also positive for Vitamin D2 received Vitamin D2-containing supplements.",1
25-OH Vitamin D2 is also detected in the serum of these four participants.,1
"Therefore, consumption of Vitamin D2-containing supplements is associated with higher Vitamin D2 detection rate among pregnant women.",1
"However, other contributing factors could not be excluded.",1
"Previous studies identify edible fungi as the primary plant-based dietary source of Vitamin D. However, edible fungi were hardly seen in the dietary records among participants in this study.",1
Such low consumption rate and amount cannot be the leading cause of high Vitamin D detection rate in these participants.,1
"Accumulation of Vitamin D2 in food chain, such as from poultry fed with Vitamin D2 fortified feeds and their eggs, also contribute to elevated Vitamin D2 levels in human bodies.",1
"As a result, higher egg consumption among participants in this study may explain the higher detection rate of Vitamin D2.",1
"In addition, researchers find dairy products in China are mainly fortified with Vitamin D3, which will not translate into higher Vitamin D2 detection rate among participants.",1
"Conclusions\nIn summary, 20.4% pregnant women with GDM in their middle and late pregnancy are deficient in Vitamin D, though their Vitamin D levels were higher than the general population.",1
"It is necessary to increase exogenous Vitamin D intake in this population especially in fall and winter, when there is an increase of Vitamin D deficiency in Beijing area.",1
"This group often uses dietary supplements containing Vitamin D. They also have a Vitamin D2 detection rate of 19.4%, which can be explained by consuming edible fungi or supplements containing Vitamin D2.",1
"Alternatively, higher eggs and poultry consumption may also explain the high detection rate.",1
Further study is needed to confirm this.,1
Maternal intake of sugar during pregnancy and childhood respiratory and\xa0atopic outcomes\n\nAbstract\nThe possible role of maternal consumption of free sugar during pregnancy in the inception of respiratory and atopic diseases has not been studied.,1
"We aimed to study the relationship between maternal intake of free sugar during pregnancy and respiratory and atopic outcomes in the offspring in a population-based birth cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.",1
"We analysed associations between maternal intake of free sugar in pregnancy (estimated by a food frequency questionnaire), and current doctor-diagnosed asthma, wheezing, hay fever, eczema, atopy, serum total IgE and lung function in children aged 7–9\u2005years (n=8956 with information on maternal diet in pregnancy and at least one outcome of interest).",1
"After controlling for potential confounders, maternal intake of free sugar was positively associated with atopy (OR for highest versus lowest quintile of sugar intake 1.38, 95% CI 1.06–1.78; per quintile p-trend=0.006) and atopic asthma (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.23–3.29; per quintile p-trend=0.004).",1
"These associations were not confounded by intake of sugar in early childhood, which was unrelated to these outcomes.",1
"Our results suggest that a higher maternal intake of free sugar during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of atopy and atopic asthma in the offspring, independently of sugar intake in early childhood.",1
Abstract:SHORT\nHigher maternal intake of sugar in pregnancy may increase the risk of allergy and allergic asthma in the offspring http://ow.ly/zehc30bFswP\n\nIntroduction\nThere has been considerable interest in the role of maternal diet in pregnancy in the aetiology of childhood asthma and atopy [1].,1
"Studies have focused particularly on the potentially beneficial effects of antioxidants, following the hypothesis that a declining intake of antioxidants in Westernised countries has led to a reduction in pulmonary antioxidant defences, and hence to an increase in prevalence of asthma and atopy in recent decades [2].",1
"An alternative hypothesis, which has received less attention, is that the epidemic of asthma and atopy in the West could partly be explained by an increasing dietary intake of foods and constituents which may be harmful.",1
"Between 1970 and 2000, there was a 25% increase in the per capita consumption of all refined sugars in the USA, matching a worldwide trend [3].",1
"Current international dietary guidelines advise people to reduce their consumption of sugar, and more particularly free sugars, which comprise sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides) added to foods or drinks by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups and unsweetened fruit juices [4].",1
"While in children a high consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages [5–7] and fruit juice [7,8] has been linked to asthma, and particularly atopic asthma [7], the relation between total maternal consumption of free sugar during pregnancy and respiratory and atopic outcomes in the offspring has not been studied.",1
"One ecological study reported a correlation between perinatal consumption of sugar and severe childhood asthma symptoms [9], but could not specifically address maternal sugar intake in pregnancy.",1
"A recent Danish birth cohort study investigated the relation between soft drink consumption, but not total free sugar intake, during pregnancy and childhood asthma and allergic rhinitis [10].",1
We have investigated whether a high intake of free sugar in pregnancy is associated with adverse respiratory and atopic outcomes in the offspring in a large population-based UK birth cohort.,1
"The FFQ was used to estimate total energy intake and daily nutrient intake, by multiplying the daily frequency of consumption of a food by the nutrient content [14] of a standard portion [15] of that food, and summing this for all the foods consumed.",1
In this way free sugar intake was estimated.,1
Potential confounders\nWe selected potential confounding factors which are known (from existing literature) to be associated with one or more of the outcomes of interest [20].,1
In Model 1 we adjusted for total energy intake only.,1
In Model 2 we adjusted additionally for all potential confounders listed above.,1
"When evidence for associations persisted, we considered other factors which can be considered either as potential confounders or potential mediators of associations between maternal free sugar intake in pregnancy and childhood outcomes, i.e.",1
"[""We therefore adjusted additionally for maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) (self-reported), gestational age at delivery, birthweight, maternal weight gain during pregnancy (all abstracted from obstetric records) and child's BMI at age 7\u2005years (based on measured height and weight at clinic) (see supplementary figure E1 showing a directed acyclic graph).""]",1
"In order to assess confounding arising from other dimensions of diet, we additionally adjusted separately for maternal intake of vitamin E, zinc, selenium, n -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), n -6 PUFAs, and total fruits and vegetables in pregnancy [1,29–31].",1
"[""To investigate confounding by post-natal sugar intake, we adjusted additionally for child's sugar intake at age 3\u2005years.""]",1
"In order to investigate potential unmeasured confounding by genetic or shared environmental or lifestyle factors, we used a parental comparison approach, whereby effect estimates for maternal sugar intake in pregnancy were compared with effect estimates for maternal and paternal sugar intake after pregnancy.",1
"If there is a causal intrauterine effect, one would expect a stronger association with maternal intake in pregnancy than with maternal post-natal intake or paternal intake (the latter two exposures cannot have a direct biological effect on offspring asthma risk) (see further details in the supplementary material) [32,33].",1
"To correct for potential loss to follow-up bias, we used inverse probability weighting and assigned to each woman a weight that was the inverse of the probability of her selection for given values of covariates (see further details in the supplementary material) [35].",1
Characteristics of the 8956 mother–child pairs who were included in the analyses and those of the 3122 mother–child pairs with information on maternal diet who were excluded because of incomplete outcome data are compared in supplementary table E1.,1
Their offspring were more likely to have weighed less at birth and to have had a lower BMI at age 7\u2005years (table\xa01).,1
"After adjustment for potential confounders, there was weak evidence for positive associations between maternal free sugar intake in pregnancy and childhood doctor-diagnosed asthma and childhood wheeze (OR comparing highest versus lowest quintile 1.31, 95% CI 0.98–1.75; per quintile p - trend=0.09 and 1.42, 95% CI 1.05–1.92; per quintile p - trend=0.08, respectively), and stronger evidence for a positive association with atopy at age 7\u2005years (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.06–1.78; per quintile p - trend=0.006) (table 2).",1
"Post hoc analysis showed a positive association between maternal intake of free sugar and atopic asthma (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.23–3.29; per quintile p - trend=0.004) (table 3).",1
"[""Further investigation of potential confounding/mediation of main findings and sensitivity analyses\nAdditional separate adjustment for maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational age at delivery, birthweight, maternal weight gain during pregnancy and child's BMI at age 7\u2005years did not substantially alter the main findings and therefore no further formal mediation analysis was conducted (supplementary table E3).""]",1
"[""Additional separate adjustment for maternal intake of vitamin E, zinc, selenium, n-3 PUFAs, n-6 PUFAs, and total fruits and vegetables in pregnancy did not substantially alter the main findings (data not shown), nor did additional separate adjustment for child's free sugar intake at age 3\u2005years (supplementary table E3).""]",1
"The significant associations of maternal free sugar intake during pregnancy with childhood atopy and atopic asthma remained, unattenuated, on mutual adjustment for paternal (respectively, maternal) post-natal exposure (table 4and supplementary table E4, respectively).",1

"We studied associations between maternal free sugar intake in pregnancy and childhood asthma status phenotypes, and did not observe any association (supplementary table E5).",1
The exclusion of 17 women with implausible energy intake estimates did not alter the main results nor did exclusion of mothers with diabetes.,1
"Maternal “diabetes” was not associated with any respiratory or atopic outcome, but was associated with higher birthweight.",1
"Discussion\nIn this population-based birth cohort study, we found that a higher maternal intake of free sugar during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of atopy and atopic asthma in the offspring, independently of sugar intake in early childhood.",1
"To the best of our knowledge, these are novel findings.",1
"While a previous ecological study reported a positive correlation between perinatal consumption of sugar and severe childhood asthma symptoms [9], the limitations of ecological studies for inferring causality are well known (not least because of the high likelihood of confounding) [36].",1
"Furthermore, that study was unable to specifically investigate the potential role of maternal intake of sugar during pregnancy nor the specific role of free sugar.",1
Our longitudinal findings linking maternal free sugar intake in pregnancy to childhood atopy and atopic asthma extend the ecological results and allow stronger causal inference.,1
"Interestingly, the findings for atopy became stronger when we examined the association with multiple sensitisation.",1
"Although previous cross-sectional studies have reported a positive association between childhood consumption of sugar-containing drinks, including fruit juice, and asthma [5–8], intake of free sugar in early childhood in our study was not associated with any respiratory or atopic outcome.",1
Mechanisms\nWe speculate that high maternal fructose consumption may underlie the positive associations between maternal intake of free sugar and childhood atopy and atopic asthma.,1
"Fructose, which is a major component of added sugars, and is present naturally in fruit juice and in sweetened drinks as added sucrose (ratio of fructose/glucose 50/50%) or isolated fructose, has been mooted as driving previous cross-sectional findings linking sugar-containing beverage consumption to asthma in children [7,8].",1
"A prospective randomised controlled trial in adults showed that dietary sugar, and especially fructose, increased levels of C-reactive protein [37].",1
"Fructose also causes generation of uric acid [38], and experimental evidence in mice suggests that uric acid may be an essential initiator and amplifier of T-helper cell type 2 (Th2) immunity and allergic inflammation, through activation of inflammatory dendritic cells [39].",1
"Alternatively, fructose might influence atopic immune responses by conditioning the gut microbiome [40,41].",1
The potential of maternal diet in pregnancy to influence inception of offspring allergic airways disease through this mechanism was recently confirmed in a mouse model [42].,1
We therefore propose that one explanation for our main findings is that high fetal exposure to fructose may cause persistence of Th2 immune responses post-natally and allergic inflammation in the developing lung.,1
"In contrast to a previous study which reported a link between gestational diabetes and risk of atopic eczema and atopy in early childhood [43], we found no association between maternal diabetes during pregnancy and any outcome in the offspring, although, as expected [44], maternal diabetes was associated with higher birthweight.",1
The lack of a relation with maternal diabetes would suggest that higher fetal exposure to glucose is unlikely to explain our main findings.,1
"[""While high fructose consumption has been proposed as a risk factor for obesity [45], we found no evidence to suggest that the associations between maternal free sugar intake and atopy and atopic asthma in the offspring were mediated by maternal BMI, gestational weight gain or child's BMI, nor by prematurity or low birthweight, assuming key assumptions necessary for mediation analyses were met [46,47].""]",1
"Strengths and limitations\nStrengths of the ALSPAC birth cohort include its size and population-based prospective design, rich information on numerous potential lifestyle and dietary confounders (including information on childhood free sugar intake and parental sugar intake outside of pregnancy), and detailed phenotypic outcome measurements.",1
"Although the FFQ that we used had not been formally calibrated against other instruments such as diet diaries, it was based on the one used by Yarnell et\xa0al.",1
"[48], which has been validated against weighed dietary records and modified in the light of a more recent weighed dietary survey [13].",1
The FFQ lacked quantitative information on soft drink consumption and this will have led to underestimation of maternal free sugar intake during pregnancy.,1
"However, as misclassification of maternal free sugar intake in pregnancy is likely to have been random with respect to childhood outcomes, the strength of associations may have been underestimated.",1
"We were unable to assess associations with maternal sugar intake in early pregnancy; however, intakes in early and late pregnancy are likely to be highly correlated.",1
"We were unable to assess whether associations between maternal intake of free sugar in pregnancy and childhood atopy and atopic asthma persist beyond the age of 7\u2005years, as no data on atopy (only data on asthma status) have been collected in ALSPAC children after the age of 7\u2005years.",1
"We think that confounding of the main findings by lifestyle or other aspects of maternal diet in pregnancy is unlikely, as we controlled for numerous potential confounders in the analyses, including nutrients and foods that have been previously linked to childhood asthma and atopy.",1
"[""Importantly, the main findings were not confounded by the offspring's free sugar intake in early childhood.""]",1
"While the possibility of residual confounding cannot be ruled out, the null findings for maternal and paternal free sugar intakes after pregnancy make confounding by unmeasured familial behaviours linked to sugar intake and asthma risk a less likely explanation.",1
"As with any longitudinal study, we cannot rule out the possibility that exclusion of mother–child pairs without complete information might have biased our findings.",1
"However, it could be argued that, for our results to be totally spurious in those included in our analysis (and for the associations to be truly null in the population as a whole), associations in the excluded mother–child pairs would have to be in the opposite direction and much stronger, compared with the positive associations we reported in the included mother–child pairs, which seems extremely unlikely.",1
"Furthermore, loss to follow-up bias has been shown to only slightly modify associations in longitudinal studies, including in ALSPAC [49], and the results of our inverse probability weighting analysis [35] confirmed that loss to follow-up is unlikely to have biased our results.",1
"In view of the multiple analyses carried out and the post hoc nature of the findings for atopic asthma, we cannot exclude the possibility that the main findings occurred by chance; hence, they should be interpreted with caution.",1
"Given the a priori nature of the hypothesis being tested, and the fact that some outcomes of interest are highly correlated, it did not seem appropriate to correct for multiple testing.",1
"However, we plan to re-examine this hypothesis in another birth cohort to see if we can replicate the main findings.",1
Conclusions and public health implications\nWe conclude that a higher maternal intake of free sugar during pregnancy may increase the risk of atopy and atopic asthma in the offspring.,1
If these findings are replicated we would design an appropriate intervention study in pregnancy to establish or refute causality.,1
"Given the very high levels of sugar consumption currently in the West, where childhood allergy and asthma are so prevalent, confirmation of a causal link would raise exciting prospects for the primary prevention of these disorders.",1
"Vitamin D deficiency in Thailand☆\nVitamin D deficiency has received increased attention over the past several years since vitamin D may play an important role not only in bone metabolism but also in a variety of non-skeletal diseases such as diabetes mellitus, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases and cancer1,2,3.",1
"[""Latitude is an important determinant of vitamin D status since the amount of UVB that penetrates the earth's surface decreases markedly with increasing latitude[8].""]",1
People residing near the equator should have lower prevalence of vitamin D deficiency compared to people living at high latitudes.,1
"However, according to the recent studies, vitamin D deficiency is also common in these countries10,11.",1
[18]showed in a recent study in Thai children that vitamin D deficiency was also highly prevalent in school children aged 3–12.9 years.,1
Thai women are at risk for vitamin D insufficiency likely due to sunscreen usage and sun avoidant behavior due to the desire to maintain a fair complexion.,1
"Living in urban areas such as in Bangkok, increases the risk of vitamin D insufficiency due to increased pollution, which decreases the amount of UVB available for cutaneous vitamin D synthesis.",1
"Thus, dietary intake of vitamin D in Thai people is generally low.",1
"In summary, despite a location near the equator where sunlight is available year round, Thai people are at risk for vitamin D insufficiency due to environmental, cultural, lifestyle and dietary factors.",1
The relatively high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency may have important health implications for Thai people as the science of vitamin D continues to be unraveled.,1
A community-based cluster randomised controlled trial in rural Bangladesh to evaluate the impact of the use of iron-folic acid supplements early in pregnancy on the risk of neonatal mortality: the Shonjibon trial\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nIron-deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency globally.,1
"Due to the high iron requirements for pregnancy, it is highly prevalent and severe in pregnant women.",1
There is strong evidence that maternal iron deficiency anaemia increases the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes.,1
"However, most of the evidence is from observational epidemiological studies except for a very few randomised controlled trials.",1
IFA supplements have also been found to reduce the preterm delivery rate and neonatal mortality attributable to prematurity and birth asphyxia.,1
These results combined indicate that IFA supplements in populations of iron-deficient pregnant women could lead to a decrease in the number of neonatal deaths mediated by reduced rates of preterm delivery.,1
"In this paper, we describe the protocol of a community-based cluster randomised controlled trial that aims to evaluate the impact of maternal antenatal IFA supplements on perinatal outcomes.",1
"Methods/design\nThe effect of the early use of iron-folic acid supplements on neonatal mortality will be examined using a community based, cluster randomised controlled trial in five districts with 30,000 live births.",1
Discussion\nThis paper aims to describe the study protocol of a community based randomised controlled trial evaluating the impact of the use of iron-folic acid supplements early in pregnancy on the risk of neonatal mortality.,1
"This study is critical because it will determine if antenatal IFA supplements commenced in the first trimester of pregnancy, rather than later, will significantly reduce neonatal deaths in the first month of life, and if this approach is cost-effective.",1
Effective interventions directed specifically at preventing neonatal deaths are required to improve overall child survival.,1
"A systematic review in 2005 found that up to 70% of neonatal deaths, worldwide, could be averted by implementing sixteen evidence-based interventions at near universal coverage (99%) that incorporated preconception, antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal interventions [3].",1
"However, this review did not include antenatal iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation for pregnant women.",1
"At that time no trials had reported the effects of IFA on neonatal mortality, although these supplements were known to benefit both maternal and infant health [3].",1
"Due to the high iron requirements for pregnancy, it is highly prevalent and severe in pregnant women [4].",1
"The first national micronutrients status survey, published in early 2013, reported that iron deficiency among non-pregnant non-lactating women was 7.1%.",1
The survey findings also suggest a positive association between natural iron content in groundwater and iron status of women [6].,1
There is strong evidence that maternal iron deficiency anaemia increases the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes.,1
"However, most of the evidence is from observational epidemiological studies except for a very few randomised controlled trials.",1
IFA supplements have also been found to reduce the preterm delivery rate and neonatal mortality attributable to prematurity and birth asphyxia [7].,1
"Other studies from low-income countries have reported that preterm delivery is one of the main contributors to neonatal deaths [12,13].",1
These results combined indicate that IFA supplements in populations of iron-deficient pregnant women could lead to a decrease in the number of neonatal deaths mediated by reduced rates of preterm delivery.,1
We thus propose a large-scale prospective trial to measure the impact of the early introduction of antenatal iron/folic acid supplementation in pregnancy on neonatal outcomes in rural Bangladesh.,1
We didn’t consider placebo because WHO and Government of Bangladesh have a recommendation that pregnant women should receive 60\xa0mg of iron supplementation.,1
But the implementation of this recommendation is inadequate.,1
"Surveys indicate that only 52% of rural women reported any use of iron/folic acid in their last pregnancy but this dropped to 39% for the poorest households, and to 34% for women with no education (3).",1
"Objectives and hypothesis\nThe trial objectives are to evaluate the effect of early availability and promotion of IFA supplements on neonatal mortality, low birthweight and preterm delivery.",1
"The primary hypothesis is that in a community-based, cluster randomized controlled trial of women from rural Bangladesh, daily supplementation with 60\xa0mg elemental iron and 400\xa0μg folic acid starting in the first trimester of pregnancy, and sustained for at least 180\xa0days, will reduce neonatal mortality by 25% from 33/1000 to 24.8/1000 live births compared to usual iron-folic acid supplementation programs.",1
"The secondary hypotheses are that the early availability and promotion of IFA supplements in intervention clusters will reduce preterm delivery by 30% (15% in control to 10.5% in intervention), and low birth weight by 30% (15% in control to 10.5% in intervention).",1
"We further hypothesised that household wealth and maternal education would modify the neonatal mortality responses with a greater reduction for women from the poorest households, and women with no education.",1
"We also hypothesised that the early start to IFA supplements would not increase iron-related side effects, e.g.",1
nausea & vomiting in intervention clusters and will be cost-effective in reducing neonatal mortality in intervention clusters.,1
"We will also exclude three Upazilas from Gazipur because of the high number of garment industries, which would have high numbers of working women and would be difficult to follow-up and eight Upazilas from Mymensingh because of the high prevalence of malaria and kalazar.",1
"We will exclude areas where access is extremely difficult, for example in flood-prone areas.",1
The findings of the formative study suggested that introduction of IFA supplements early in pregnancy is feasible with support from BRAC or government community health workers.,1
"The formative study also suggested to include culturally sensitive reasons for the use of IFA supplements during pregnancy, improvement of the community health-worker training modules and to standardise messages across all health workers.",1
"Assuming a crude birth rate of 23 per 1000 people, 10% loss of pregnancies before birth and 15% loss to follow up each cluster will yield 300 births over 15\xa0months, and this will be sufficient to reach the desired sample size.",1
The models will evaluate the impact of the interventions over time by testing for an interaction between time and intervention group.,1
"We will conduct analyses to identify the subgroups (based on household wealth, sex of infant and maternal education) that modify the response to the intervention.",1
"Discussion\nIron deficiency is associated with increased risk of maternal death, preterm delivery, impaired foetal growth and development, low birth weight, increased neonatal mortality and impaired infant development [17].",1
"Although the importance of IFA supplements to prevent maternal anaemia and mortality is widely accepted, most antenatal IFA supplements distribution programs are of low priority.",1
"Evaluations of these programs using maternal anaemia as the outcome report little or no impact because of the multiple causes of maternal anaemia, low compliance, and inadequate distribution programs.",1
"Recent surveys in Bangladesh indicate that only 52% of rural women reported any use of IFA supplements in their last pregnancy, but this falls to 39% for the poorest households, and to 34% for women with no education [5].",1
"In the Projahnmo trial conducted in rural Bangladesh, only 40% of women in the baseline surveys reported any use of IFA supplements in pregnancy [18].",1
"Access to IFA supplements is through antenatal care, however, in rural Bangladesh, the median gestation that women commence antenatal care is 5.2\xa0months, and 44% of women report no use of antenatal care [5].",1
"Although they did not start early, these figures indicate there is a substantial opportunity to improve IFA supplements distribution in rural Bangladesh.",1
There is limited evidence about the optimal timing of IFA supplementation in pregnancy.,1
Promising evidence came from a trial in China investigating the effects of IFA supplements in pregnancy on neonatal deaths [19].,1
"However, the neonatal mortality analyses were post-hoc analyses, and the sample size was small resulting in poor precision in the effect estimates, and reduced power to explore all the factors modifying the effects on neonatal mortality.",1
"Thus, the impact of early IFA supplements on neonatal mortality needs confirmation in a larger scale trial.",1
"This project will determine if antenatal IFA supplements commenced in the first trimester of pregnancy, rather than later, will significantly reduce neonatal deaths in the first month of life, and if this approach is cost-effective.",1
"It will also provide valuable evidence about the role of groundwater iron level in modifying the responses of antenatal IFA supplements on neonatal mortality since there is already some evidence which suggests a positive, dose-response association between natural iron in groundwater and the iron status of women [6].",1
Maternal diet during pregnancy is related with the infant stool microbiome in a delivery mode-dependent manner\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nThe gut microbiome has an important role in infant health and immune development and may be affected by early-life exposures.,1
Maternal diet may influence the infant gut microbiome through vertical transfer of maternal microbes to infants during vaginal delivery and breastfeeding.,1
We aimed to examine the association of maternal diet during pregnancy with the infant gut microbiome 6\xa0weeks post-delivery in mother-infant dyads enrolled in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study.,1
"In the analyses stratified to infants born vaginally and adjusted for other potential confounders, maternal fruit intake was associated with infant gut microbial community structure (PERMANOVA, p \u2009<\u20090.05).",1
"In multinomial logistic regression analyses, increased fruit intake was associated with an increased odds of belonging to the high Streptococcus / Clostridium group among infants born vaginally (OR (95% CI)\u2009=\u20092.73 (1.36, 5.46)).",1
"Maternal dairy intake was associated with an increased odds of infants belonging to the high Clostridium cluster in infants born by Cesarean section (OR (95% CI)\u2009=\u20092.36 (1.05, 5.30)).",1
Linear models suggested additional associations between maternal diet and infant intestinal microbes in both delivery mode strata.,1
Conclusions\nOur data indicate that maternal diet influences the infant gut microbiome and that these effects differ by delivery mode.,1
"Background\nStudies have examined the maternal contribution to infant health, including the effect of maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation.",1
Prenatal diet influences the risk of infant and child allergy.,1
"For instance, the Mediterranean diet during pregnancy has been associated with a reduced risk of both persistent and atopic wheeze and atopy in children at 6.5\xa0years old [1,2].",1
"High meat consumption during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of wheeze in the first year of life, while maternal dairy intake is associated with a reduced risk of infantile wheeze [2].",1
Little is known about the actual mechanisms by which maternal diet affects children’s health; we hypothesize that maternal diet impacts the development of the gut microbiome in infancy and subsequently influences child health outcomes.,1
It is established that diet is an important driver of the gut microbiome.,1
Short-term diets comprised solely of either plant or animal foods have been shown to alter the human gut microbiome [3].,1
"To date, there has been limited investigation of the relation of maternal diet with the developing infant gut microbiome.",1
One study observed that maternal high-fat diet during pregnancy was associated with meconium microbial composition but had limited maternal diet data [6].,1
One mechanism the infant gut microbiome may be affected by maternal diet is via vertical transfer of maternal microbes to infants at delivery.,1
"There is a well-established relation of the infant gut microbiome with delivery mode (Cesarean section versus vaginally born infants) [7,8] which may persist through adulthood [9].",1
"Alternatively, maternal diet may affect fetal development and subsequent host response to microbial populations at and after birth.",1
"Additionally, differences in breast milk composition due to maternal diet may contribute to the infant gut microbiome in breastfed infants.",1
We examined the relationship of maternal diet during pregnancy with the infant stool microbiome in 6-week-old infants and identified associations within delivery mode groups.,1
"Adjusting for infant feeding method, maternal BMI, parity, and batch, maternal fruit consumption was associated with infant stool microbiome composition (generalized UniFrac distance PERMANOVA, p \u2009=\u20090.028; Table\xa02; Fig.",1
"In a sensitivity analysis, the effect of maternal fruit consumption on the infant gut microbiome in babies born vaginally persisted when restricted to infants who were exclusively breastfed (generalized UniFrac distance PERMANOVA, p \u2009=\u20090.022; Table\xa02 ) .",1

"1b\n\nOperational taxonomic units in the infant gut and maternal dietary factors\nTo investigate the microbial taxa that may drive differences observed above, we measured associations between each maternal dietary factor and the relative abundance of individual infant stool operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with linear models adjusted for feeding method, maternal BMI, parity, and batch.",1
"While the microbiome-wide significance of maternal dietary factors after adjusting p values using the false discovery rate (FDR) method was not observed, OTUs with the same taxonomic assignment tended to appear together in the most significant results, supporting a true association of maternal dietary factors and infant gut microbiota.",1
"Maternal aMED score was positively associated with OTUs classified to the family Enterobacteriaceae , the genus Streptococcus , and the family Clostridiaceae , and negatively with OTUs classified to the species Bacteroides uniformis , the Enterobacteriaceae family, and the species Escherichia coli and [Ruminococcus] gnavus (Fig.",1
"Maternal dairy intake was positively associated with OTUs classified to the species Clostridium neonatale and C. butyricum and the genus Staphylococcus , and negatively related to OTUs classified to the Lachnospiraceae family (Additional\xa0file\xa01: Table S2b).",1
"OTUs classified to the genus Streptococcus including the species Streptococcus agalactiae were positively associated with maternal fish and seafood intake, while OTUs classified to the species Bacteroides uniformis were negatively associated (Additional\xa0file\xa01: Table S2c).",1
We observed a negative association between fruit intake and OTUs of the genus Bifidobacterium and a positive association with OTUs in the Clostridiaceae family in the infant gut (Additional\xa0file\xa01: Table S2d).,1
"We observed additional associations between these and other maternal dietary factors and infant stool OTUs, which are presented in the supplementary tables.",1
Associations in infants delivered by Cesarean section\nWe separately assessed the relation of maternal diet with the infant gut microbiome in infants delivered by Cesarean section ( n \u2009=\u200948).,1
"In an adjusted analysis, maternal dairy intake was associated with infant stool microbiome composition (generalized UniFrac distance PERMANOVA, p \u2009=\u20090.034; Fig.",1
"Linear models indicated a positive association of maternal dairy intake with OTUs classified to the family Enterobacteriaceae and the species Escherichia coli and negative association with the OTUs that belong to the genera Bifidobacterium , Pseudomonas , and Bacteroides (Additional\xa0file\xa01: Table S5b).",1
"One OTU classified to the genus Corynebacterium was negatively associated with maternal dairy intake ( p \u2009=\u20090.0044), and one each OTU classified to the species Acinetobacter rhizosphaerae ( p \u2009=\u20090.0040) and to the family Ruminococcaceae ( p \u2009=\u20090.0061), respectively, were also positively associated with maternal dairy intake, but we did not observe multiple related OTUs with similar associations.",1
"OTUs classified to the genus Enterococcus (one q value <\u20090.10) and the Lachnospiraceae family were positively related with and OTUs classified to the family Enterobacteriaceae , the species Escherichia coli and the genera Streptococcus and Blautia , were negatively related with the maternal aMED score (Additional\xa0file\xa01: Table S5a).",1
"As in vaginally delivered infants, maternal fish and seafood intake was positively associated with OTUs in the genus Streptococcus in infants delivered by Cesarean section (Additional\xa0file\xa01: Table S5c).",1
"In contrast to infants born vaginally, maternal dietary fish and seafood were positively associated with OTUs in the genus Bacteroides including the species B. uniformis and negatively associated with OTUs in the species Clostridium neonatale and other OTUs of the Streptococcus genus (Additional\xa0file\xa01: Table S5c).",1
"Additionally, maternal red and processed meat was positively associated with OTUs in the genus Bifidobacterium among others including the species Escherichia coli and the genus Enterococcus (Additional\xa0file\xa01: Table S5e).",1
2\n\nAssociations between maternal diet and infant gut microbial communities in infants delivered vaginally.,1
c Linear model associations between maternal aMED score and relative abundance of infant stool OTUs.,1
"in taxonomy labels indicate that the level of taxonomy is family, genus, or species\n\nDiscussion\nWe observed differences in both overall infant gut microbial community structure and specific microbes in relation to maternal dietary factors, often in a delivery mode-dependent pattern.",1
"Some effects of maternal diet were more apparent in exclusively breastfed infants; however, we were unable to compare to exclusively formula-fed infants since most infants received some breast milk.",1
"We found maternal fish and seafood consumption to be positively related to OTUs in the genus Streptococcus in the infant gut, which included the species Streptococcus agalactiae , or Group B Streptococcus .",1
Fish consumption is generally recommended as healthful due to its DHA and EPA content despite the exposure to heavy metals and other contaminants that may be detrimental to health [12].,1
"For instance, greater fish consumption is associated with child development outcomes including decreased risk of asthma and improved cognition [13,14].",1
The decrease in OTUs classified to the species Clostridium neonatale with increased maternal fish and seafood intake in infants born by Cesarean section is a possibly beneficial change to infant intestinal microbial communities.,1
We observed consistent associations between maternal DHA and EPA intake and infant gut microbiota.,1
"The associations of other maternal dietary factors with specific infant gut microbes were also somewhat unexpected, namely for red and processed meat and for fruit consumption.",1
"While fruit is considered healthful and red and processed meat consumption is recommended to be limited, OTUs in the genus Bifidobacterium , generally recognized as a beneficial microbe, were decreased with increasing maternal fruit consumption in vaginally born infants yet increased with higher maternal red and processed meat consumption in those born by Cesarean section.",1
The results from infant gut microbiome cluster analyses are consistent with this observation.,1
"For example, it is surprising that higher maternal fruit intake is associated with an increased probability of an infant delivered vaginally belonging to cluster 2, in which the genera Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides are underrepresented and the family Clostridiaceae is overrepresented compared to the other two clusters.",1
The effect of maternal dairy intake on infant gut microbiota was primarily observed in infants delivered by Cesarean section.,1
"One recent study suggests that both the microbial and fatty acid composition of breast milk may differ by delivery mode [18], so the differential effect of maternal dairy intake by delivery mode on the infant gut microbiome may be attributable to the differences in breast milk microbiota or lipids in relation to maternal diet by delivery mode.",1
"Our observation of increased colonization with the species Acinetobacter rhizosphaerae , a microbe that colonizes and promotes growth in plants [19], with maternal dairy in the Cesarean group is interesting in conjunction with the positive associations found between maternal dairy and the species Clostridium neonatale and Staphylococcus genus in vaginally delivered infants.",1
"Species of the genus Acinetobacter are increasingly involved in nosocomial infections [20], while the species Clostridium neonatale was initially isolated from infants affected by necrotizing enterocolitis [21], and the pathogenic potential of species in the genus Staphylococcus is well-established [22,23].",1
"Thus, it will be important to investigate whether maternal dairy consumption fosters the growth of potentially pathogenic microbes in the infant gut, particularly for infants delivered operatively.",1
"In several cases, a maternal dietary factor was associated with a microbe in both delivery groups but in opposite directions.",1
"Since Cesarean delivery results in differential microbial community structure of the infant gut [24], and the gut microbiome is a complex system, such differences are plausible; experimental studies will be required to confirm this observation.",1
"However, the associations between maternal diet and infant gut microbial communities did not always differ by delivery mode.",1
"For example, the maternal aMED score was consistently positively and negatively associated with the Enterobacteriaceae family, and additionally negatively associated with the species Escherichia coli , in both delivery mode strata.",1
"Our study sample was drawn from Northern New England, which has a relatively homogenous population; this could limit the generalizability of the study.",1
"However, by limiting unmeasured confounding due to differences in human microbiomes between populations that may result in erroneous associations with dietary differences, our study also may have greater internal validity.",1
"Maternal diet was assessed by self-report between 24 and 28\xa0weeks of gestation, and it is possible that dietary patterns change near the end of pregnancy or during lactation.",1
"However, diets are often stable, and a mid-pregnancy food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-assessment is likely to be sufficiently representative of late pregnancy and lactation diet in a high proportion of individuals [25,26].",1
"Nonetheless, the effects we observe may be due in part to maternal diet during lactation.",1
"Further, we cannot conclude if the effects of maternal diet occur only in breastfed babies, or also in those mostly fed formula, or a combination of formula and breast milk.",1
It is also possible that associations between maternal exposures and infant microbiota at 6\xa0weeks of life are influenced by factors not investigated in this study.,1
"Future studies examining the relationship between maternal diet and components of breast milk including microbial and nutritional profiles, as well as the potential influence of maternal diet on the fetal microbiome, may offer insight into the mechanisms by which maternal diet influences the infant gut microbiome.",1
Determining the impact of changes in the gut microbiome of infants due to maternal diet on infant health and development is an opportunity to refine dietary recommendations for pregnant and lactating women to support infant health.,1
"Conclusions\nIn conclusion, we identified three clusters of infant gut microbial communities and observed effects of multiple maternal prenatal dietary factors on the infant gut microbiome that often varied by delivery mode.",1
"In preliminary analyses of all infants, delivery mode, feeding method, as previously shown in our cohort [24], and parity were significantly related to infant stool microbial community composition at 6\xa0weeks of age.",1
Adjusted analyses included both variables known to be related to the infant gut microbiome by previous studies and variables significantly related to infant gut microbiota in our population to control confounding.,1
"To assess the relationship between each maternal dietary factor and infant gut microbiome cluster membership, we used multinomial logistic regression in the R package nnet adjusting all models for the same covariates as in previous analyses.",1
"To more precisely identify which microbial taxa contribute to the observed differences in infant stool microbial community composition by maternal dietary factors, we used a series of linear models to test the relationships between each maternal dietary factor and each OTU.",1
All analyses were analogously performed in the Cesarean section group to assess if an effect of maternal diet on the infant gut microbiome exists in the case of surgical delivery.,1
We were unable to adjust for antibiotic usage due to a paucity of exposure and imprecise data on timing of exposure.,1
"Genetic, management, and nutritional factors affecting intramuscular fat deposition in beef cattle — A review\n\nAbstract\nIntramuscular fat (IMF) content in skeletal muscle including the longissimus dorsi muscle (LM), also known as marbling fat, is one of the most important factors determining beef quality in several countries including Korea, Japan, Australia, and the United States.",1
"Genetics and breed, management, and nutrition affect IMF deposition.",1
"Here, we review results of research on genetic factors (breed and sex differences and heritability) that affect IMF deposition.",1
Cattle management factors are also important for IMF deposition.,1
"The effects of several management factors, including weaning age, castration, slaughter weight and age, and environmental conditions on IMF deposition are also reviewed.",1
"Nutritional factors, including fat metabolism, digestion and absorption of feed, glucose/starch availability, and vitamin A, D, and C levels are important for IMF deposition.",1
Manipulating IMF deposition through developmental programming via metabolic imprinting is a recently proposed nutritional method to change potential IMF deposition during the fetal and neonatal periods in rodents and domestic animals.,1
The coordination of several factors affects IMF deposition.,1
"Thus, a combination of several strategies may be needed to manipulate IMF deposition, depending on the consumer’s beef preference.",1
"INTRODUCTION\nIntramuscular fat (IMF) deposition or marbling in muscle including the longissimus thoracis et lumborum , infraspinatus , and biceps femoris , especially in Korean cattle (also called Hanwoo) and Japanese Black cattle, is one of the most important traits influencing beef quality and palatability attributes.",1
"Marbling is positively correlated with juiciness, tenderness, and palatability of beef [1].",1
The production of highly marbled beef in Korea is essential to compete with cheap imported beef that has a relatively low marbling score (MS).,1
"Several countries, including Korea, Japan, Australia and the USA, have considered IMF content as important to beef quality grade (QG), whereas European countries, including France and Germany, prefer leaner meat (less IMF content).",1
Understanding the factors affecting IMF deposition and the mechanisms responsible for its deposition is important when manipulating IMF deposition.,1
"Factors affecting IMF deposition can be sub-categorized into genetic (breed and sex differences, heritability), management (weaning age, castration, slaughter weight and age, and environment), and nutritional factors (fat metabolism, fat digestion and absorption, glucose/starch availability, roughage vs concentrate ratio, dietary energy and protein levels, vitamins A, D, and C levels, fetal and neonatal nutritional programming, and stage-specific feeding systems).",1
"Here, we also review these factors affecting IMF deposition in cattle.",1
It is important to identify the mechanisms responsible for initial muscle and fat cell growth during the developmental stage of cattle to better understand IMF deposition in later life.,1
"Du et al [16] proposed that myogenic, adipogenic, and fibrogenic cells are derived from common mesenchymal progenitor cells.",1
"Briefly, they proposed that mesenchymal stem cells are first committed to the myogenic and adipogenic–fibrogenic cell lineages during fetal muscle development [16].",1
Du et al [17] suggested that a shift in development of mesenchymal stem cells from myogenesis to adipogenesis may increase IMF deposition later in life.,1
It has been suggested that adipocyte formation in muscle begins approximately between late gestation and 250 d after birth in cattle [16].,1
Both hyperplasia and hypertrophy are involved in IMF deposition (Figure 1).,1
"Therefore, strategies that up-regulate both hyperplasia and hypertrophy of fat cells are effective ways to improve IMF deposition.",1
The nutritional and physiological condition of the fetus and the early postnatal stage affects the number of adipocytes in adipose tissues of animals [16].,1
"Thus, managing maternal nutrition is a potentially effective way to promote adipogenesis in fetal muscle [16].",1
Du et al [17] suggested that the order of effectiveness of nutritional management for manipulating IMF deposition is fetal stage>neonatal stage> weaning stage>older stages.,1
Harper and Pethick [23] recommended that producers focus on individuals with high genetic capacity to create more preadipocytes within animal muscle.,1
Albrecht et al [24] reported that hyperplasia of preadipocytes also plays an important role in marbling formation during postnatal growth of IMF because new marbling flecks appear after recruitment and filling with preadipocytes.,1
"Thus, during the late fattening stage of beef cattle, marbling adipocytes may grow continuously even though development of abdominal, intermuscular, and subcutaneous fat may slow or cease.",1
GENETIC FACTORS\n\nBreed and sex differences\nIntramuscular fat content in the LM varies significantly depending on the cattle breed.,1
Sex affects IMF content in the LM.,1
"Castrating bulls gener ally increases IMF content in several breeds, including Korean cattle and Holstein [9,38–40].",1
Heritability\nHeritability of the marbling trait has been reported in several cattle breeds.,1
Utrera and Van Vleck [41] presented estimates of heritability for cattle carcass traits in 72 studies (1962 through 2004).,1
The genetic potential of individual cattle can significantly affect IMF deposition.,1
"Greenwood et al [30] conducted a study to test effects of genotypes and nutrition during the immediate postweaning period on IMF contents in 5 muscles, marbling, and subcutaneous fat (rib fat or P8 rump fat) in Bos Taurus steers.",1
"Following weaning, steers were grown with a forage-only system and forage with high-energy supplemented system to test effects of a high-energy grain-based substitution on fat deposition with 5 times serial slaughter.",1
"In their study, genotype differences were generally observed in IMF contents of 4 muscles ( biceps femoris , supraspinatus , semitendinosus , longissimus lumborum , and infraspinatus ), although semitendinosus muscle IMF did not differ among genotypes.",1
"However, substitution of equivalent amount of energy from grazed pasture with high-energy grain-based feed has not increased IMF contents.",1
"Selecting a sire is important for high-quality beef production; animals with high genetic potential will generally exhibit higher MS at slaughter age, whereas animals with low genetic potential will give low MS [50].",1
"MANAGEMENT FACTORS\nSeveral management factors, including weaning age, castration, slaughter age and weight, nutrition and other environmental conditions can affect IMF deposition.",1
Weaning age\nWeaning age is known to affect IMF deposition and MS in beef.,1
Several studies have reported that early weaning or early weaning combined with a high-grain diet increases IMF deposition in beef cattle.,1
Effect of weaning age has been studied in Shorthorn calves [52].,1
"However, weaning treatment did not affect feed efficiency, post weaning growth, MS, and other carcass traits.",1
"In the Angus study, early weaning at 105 d of age and high concentrate feeding for 148 d followed by grazing and feedlot entry increased both the MS and hot carcass weight (HCW) compared with normal weaning at 253 d of age (normally weaned calves stayed with their dams to graze on pasture), although feedlot performance remained unchanged [54].",1
The authors suggested that metabolic imprinting by early weaning and a high concentrate feeding before grazing is a feasible method to improve MS and carcass weight.,1
A molecular study revealed that early weaning and a high-starch diet activated precocious pre-adipocyte differentiation and fat accumulation by activating adipogenic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARG) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α pathways.,1
"Smith and Johnson [57] suggested that the glucose contribution to fat synthesis decreases as cattle become fatter, whereas acetate use increases, especially in the IMF area.",1
"Those authors also suggested that providing dietary glucose sources (e.g., high-starch diet) at an early age can improve IMF deposition.",1
The authors suggested that feeding concentrate plus roughage or starch after early weaning at a young age could alter adipogenic and lipogenic potential in loin meat.,1
"Castration\nCastration of bulls generally increases IMF content in several cattle breeds, although it reduces growth rate [40].",1
"A 2016 report of nationwide pooled data in Korean cattle revealed that the majority (76%) of bulls had a QG 3, whereas 85.5% of castrated cattle showed grades of QG 1 or higher (QG1, QG1+, and QG1++) ([59];Figure 2).",1
"However, these changes with slaugther age were not observed in double-muscled Belgian Blue bulls [24].",1
The MS generally increases with slaughter age in Korean cattle.,1
This study suggested that changes in MS with slaughter age vary among farms.,1
"The difference may be due to genetic factors, management, or feed.",1
Decreasing slaughter age may be better for reducing production costs when feed prices are high.,1
"Pethick et al [69] suggested that a prolonged feeding period gives the cattle time to obtain high IMF levels because time is needed for muscle to reach maturity, followed by time for the muscle to fill up with IMF.",1
"However, feed efficiency decreases as animals age due to a decrease in the rate of muscle growth [70].",1
"Thus, animals with low genetic potential for QG are not recommended for a long fattening stage, which would result in low feed efficiency.",1
"In addition, a long fattening period could result in low yield grade (YG) because long-term fattening increases backfat thickness and carcass weight, which negatively affect YG in Korean cattle [59].",1
"Slaughter age needs to be optimised to get maximum profits for farmers by monitoring the QG and quantity grade of carcasses, feed costs, and carcass prices (auction prices).",1
Slaughter weight\nIMF content or MS generally increases with slaughter weight in several cattle breeds.,1
The National Beef Quality Audit of the USA (beef of steers and heifers in 28 packing plants during October–December 1991) found that MS increased with increasing slaugher weight from 173 to over 543 kg [71].,1
"Several factors, including MS or QG, feed costs, and carcass prices need to be considered to determine the optimum slaughter weight for the maximum profit.",1
"Environments\nStudies have demonstrated that environmental conditions, such as temperature stress, can negatively affect animal growth and beef quality in cattle [74].",1
Our recent study indicated that a lower ambient temperature decreased growth and feed efficiency in Korean cattle steers [78].,1
"Heat stress can also negatively affect animal performance, including growth, milk production, reproduction, feed intake, overall health, and well-being in cattle [79,80].",1
"The authors suggested that mild heat stress in summer and mild cold stress in winter may be beneficial to fat deposition under ad libitum feeding conditions for cattle fed in an unprotected, unsheltered area.",1
They also suggested that animals deposit fat in the winter to provide insulation for the body under cold stress.,1
Animals may require more energy to meet the increased maintenance energy requirements.,1
"Young [81] suggested that energy requirements increase during winter or when animals are under cold stress, as increased heat production is needed to maintain body temperature by shivering or other thermogenic process.",1
Angus crossbred cattle exposed to greater heat stress tend to have a greater MS [82].,1
The authors mentioned that slight heat stress might induce IMF deposition.,1
Seasonal variations in carcass characteristics have been observed in Korean cattle steers by our group [2].,1
"Therefore, the poor YG in winter may be due, in part, to high backfat thickness.",1
"However, both MS and QG were best in autumn and worst in spring.",1
Our recent study also revealed that growth performance was not affected by mild heat stress in Korean cattle [83].,1
"Overall, severe temperature stress may have significant negative effects on animal production, including growth performance and product quality, although mild temperature stress may differentially affect production.",1
"NUTRITIONAL FACTORS\nSeveral nutritional factors including fat metabolism, fat digestion and absorption, glucose/starch availability, roughage vs. concentrate ratio, dietary energy and protein levels, vitamins A, D, and C levels, fetal nutritional programming, and stage-specific feeding systems can affect IMF deposition.",1
"The activity of ATP citrate lyase is known to be low in ruminants [87]; thus, glucose is used as a lipogenic substrate less in ruminants than in monogastric animals [87].",1
"However, glucose is believed to be preferred to acetate as a substrate for FA synthesis for IMF deposition [88].",1
"Using an in vitro system of adipose tissue from Angus and Wagyu steers, Rhoades et al [91] reported that the rate of glucose incorporation into FA was over two times higher than the rate of acetate incorporation into IMF, although they were similar in subcutaneous fat.",1
"The same authors suggested that feeding a corn-based diet increased glucose uptake in IMF, whereas feeding a hay-based diet may promote subcutaneous fat deposition via incorporation of acetate into FAs.",1
Fat addition can affect IMF deposition.,1
"Therefore, increased glucose availability is important for providing glycerol for IMF deposition in ruminants [69], similar to monogastric animals such as pigs.",1
"Increasing propionate production for glucose synthesis is also important for IMF deposition, especially during the fattening period.",1
"For this reason, a large amount of concentrate is fed during the fattening period in Japanese Wagyu and Korean beef cattle [95,96].",1
High levels of IMF deposition requires excess energy con sumption above the maintenance and normal production requirements [69].,1
"These results suggest that higher energy levels are required for IMF deposition than for general body fat deposition, including for subcutaneous fat deposition.",1
"Cortisol is also an important regulator of energy metabolism, including the regulation of lipolysis and lipogenesis, and increases plasma NEFA concentrations [100].",1
"In addition, our recent research has shown that transport stress causes temporal increases in circulating cortisol and NEFA concentrations, along with a decrease in circulating TG concentration in pregnant Holstein heifers [103], consistent with transport stress also causing lipolysis.",1
"Thus, stressors, such as temperature and transportation, may have a negative effect on IMF deposition through lipolysis in beef cattle.",1
"Therefore, fat degradation by lipolysis should be minimized to prevent loss of IMF, and management and transport systems that minimize stress are needed.",1
Fat supplementation for extra energy supply has been recommended during cold or heat stress to prevent fat degradation.,1
"However, some studies have revealed that mild temperature stress can increase body fat deposition and marbling for insulation and other purposes [74,82], as described above.",1
Further study is warranted to clarify how stress intensity affects animal performance and fat deposition.,1
Manipulating dietary fat digestion and absorption in the small intestine may enhance MS. Emulsifying fat may affect the digestion and absorption of fat.,1
Bile acid supplementation may enhance fat digestion.,1
"Ursodeoxycholic acid supplementation increased IMF and QG in Wagyu heifers [26], demonstrating that bile acid supplementation improves IMF deposition, probably by increasing intestinal fat digestion and absorption by increasing fat emulsification.",1
Glucose/starch availability and roughage vs concentrate ratios\nConsuming surplus net energy is an important factor for deposition of IMF.,1
Feeding cereal grains is one way to raise net energy supply because energy dense grains can be utilized in the rumen and the small intestine to produce volatile fatty acids and glucose for energy production.,1
Maximum starch utilization can be achieved by optimizing fermentation of starch in the rumen to produce propionate (gluconeogenic precursor) and maximizing starch digestion and absorption in the small intestine.,1
"A considerable amount of glucose is absorbed from the small intestine when high-starch diets are fed, especially during the beef cattle fattening period.",1
Ørskov [110] reported that up to 42% of dietary starch may escape ruminal fermentation and reach the small intestine.,1
"A meta-analysis of starch digestion in dairy cows revealed that the ruminal digestibility of corn was 57.4% [112], demonstrating that a substantial portion of corn can be digested in the small intestine.",1
The same report estimated that up to 2 kg of starch/d can be digested in the small intestine of dairy cows; the average starch digestibility in the small intestine was 60.6%.,1
"Therefore, a better method to achieve high digestibility of starch in the small intestine is required to provide high post-absorptive glucose to the host animal.",1
"Pethick et al [69] reported that a high level of diet processing can increase the accessibility of dietary starch granules for both rumen and small intestine amylases, resulting in maximum glucose availability to the fattening animal [113].",1
"Grain type and processing affect IMF content [115]: maize is more effective at increasing IMF content than is barley, followed by sorghum.",1
Bindon [115] suggested that maize produces increased glucose from digestion in the small intestine and that steam flaking increases digestion in both the rumen and small intestine.,1
Pethick et al [69] suggested that feed that has a high glycemic index to allow rapid glucose absorption and concomitant high insulin levels through either grain feeding instead of grass finishing or grain processing provides increased net energy levels for FA synthesis.,1
Several studies have reported higher IMF content in high concentrate diets compared with low concentrate diets (reviewed in Wood et al [116]).,1
"In bulls of two Portuguese breeds (Alentejana and Barrosã), the effects of high (70% concentrate 30% maize silage) and low isoenergetic and isonitrogenous concentrates (30% concentrate 70% maize silage) on IMF contents were examined in the longissimus lumborum and the semitendinosus muscles [119].",1
"However, this difference was not observed in Alentejana bulls, indicating a breed difference in IMF content in response to the roughage-to-concentrate ratio.",1
"Similarly, dietary forage level affected MS. Jersey steers fed a low forage diet (6% Sudan grass, 6% alfalfa hay and 63.15% steam-flaked corn, dry matter [DM] basis) in a feedlot finishing diet had greater MS in the strip loin than did animals fed a high forage level diet (12% Sudan grass, 12% alfalfa hay and 51.20% steam-flaked corn) [121].",1
The effects of roughage/concentrate ratio on body fat deposition and the expression of angiogenic and adipogenic factors in adipose tissue have been examined in fattening Wagyu steers [122].,1
"However, fat weights in the subcutaneous, mesenteric, and intermuscular regions were not different between the groups.",1
"The expression of adipogenic factors (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha, and PPARG) in the subcutaneous fat and IMF was higher in the high-concentrate group than that in the low-concentrate group, indicating that the dietary roughage/concentrate ratio affects adipogenic gene expression in fat tissues.",1
The same authors suggested that total IMF within the LM in the high-concentrate group might be greater than that in the low-concentrate group by stimulating intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation.,1
"Concentrate diets are generally a major glucose source through either production of rumen propionate or glucose absorption from the small intestine from a rumen-bypassed concentrate, as described above, whereas roughage is a major acetate source that results from the rumen fermentation process.",1
"Higher IMF deposition with higher concentrate feeding may occur if IMF preferentially uses glucose as a substrate for FA synthesis, while subcutaneous fat uses acetate, as described by Smith and Crouse [88].",1
"Dietary energy and protein levels\nStudies in pigs indicate that a deficiency of essential amino acids such as lysine increases IMF content [123,124], and it has been suggested that an amino acid imbalance relative to energy levels may increase IMF content in cattle (reviewed in Pethick et al [69]).",1
Limited information is available on the effects of the dietary energy-to-protein ratio on IMF content in cattle.,1
"Effects of dietary energy (TDN: 70%, 80%; DM basis) and protein levels (crude protein [CP]: 11.9%, 14.3%; DM basis) on growth performance, carcass characteristics and meat quality were examined in F1 Angus×Chinese Xiangxi yellow cattle [125].",1
"Steers in the high-energy group had greater LM IMF content than those in the low-energy group, whereas dietary protein levels did not affect IMF content.",1
"However, dietary protein levels do not affect IMF deposition in Angus or Shorthorn steers (reviewed in Bindon [115]).",1
"Therefore, current studies are inconsistent in their results and conclusions on the effects of dietary protein levels affect IMF deposition.",1
"Vitamins\nSeveral vitamins, including vitamins A, D, and C, are implicated in regulating IMF deposition.",1
"A negative correlation was observed between serum retinol concentrations and carcass MS values in Japanese Black cattle [130,131].",1
"Several studies have shown that restricting vitamin A in the diet, or low beta-carotene (a precursor of vitamin A) intake, increases body fat, including IMF, deposition.",1
"The appropriate age for, and duration of, vitamin A deple tion or supplementation have been suggested as important factors that affect MS. Oka et al [134] reported that restricting vitamin A in 15-month-old cattle until the final finishing phase (29 months of age) increased MS, but not in 23-month-old cattle prior to finishing.",1
They suggested that serum vitamin A level affects the LM MS during the early fattening stage and that restricting vitamin A during the later stages of growth affects growth rate.,1
"Oka et al [134] recommended selective restriction of dietary vitamin A from 14 to 22 or 25 months of age to improve MS and QG without adverse health effects (blindness, arthritis, and muscular edema), given the effect of vitamin A restriction from 23 months of age in improving MS is minimal.",1
Continuous dietary vitamin A restriction during the late fattening phase is not recommended because prolonged vitamin A restriction may lead to health problems and retard growth rate [130].,1
"A continuous supply of normal levels of dietary vitamin A during the entire growth period may also result in poor marbling and QG, even if the growth rate were normal and no health problems occurred.",1
"Kawachi [137] described that the number of adipocytes increases in muscle between 13 and 19 months of age, so feeding a vitamin A-deficient diet during this stage may stimulate marbling.",1
"The appropriate concentration range for restriction of vita min A has been suggested as an important factor for enhancing MS and preventing health-related problems, including the incidence of blindness and muscular edema.",1
Oka [134] recommended that vitamin A-deficient levels not fall below 30 IU/dL to enhance MS and maintain health.,1
Ward et al [140] examined nutrigenetic interactions between the alcohol dehydrogenase 1C ( ADH1C ) single nucleotide polymorphism ( ADH1C c.-64T>C) and vitamin A levels and the impact on IMF deposition in Angus-cross steers.,1
A significant interaction was detected between ADH1C c.-64T>C genotype and vitamin A supplementation for IMF content in the LM.,1
"They concluded that the TT genotype of ADH1C c.-64T>C is related to greater IMF than the CC genotype when vitamin A is restricted, and ADH1C c.-64T>C could be a genetic marker for enhancing marbling in feedlot steers.",1
"One study reported that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3inhibited lipid accumulation by inhibiting key adipogenic factors such as PPARG [143].",1
Wang et al [144] suggested that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) competes with PPARG for binding to the retinoid X receptor (RXR).,1
"Higher VDR/RXR binding may decrease formation of the PPARG/RXR heterodimer, thus inhibiting adipogenesis (Figure 4).",1
Few in vivo studies have been performed on the effect of vitamin D on beef marbling.,1
"While vitamin A restriction improves marbling, but vitamin D restriction did not significantly affect marbling in Angus crossbred steers [133].",1
Further study is needed to clarify the effects of dietary vitamin D on MS and QG in beef cattle.,1
"Smith et al [145] suggested a possible connection between 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3and calcium homeostasis in the regulation of marbling.",1
"The increase in blood 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3levels in response to decreased calcium intake may downregulate preadipocyte differentiation, thus decreasing beef marbling.",1
"Thus, the dietary vitamin C requirement for beef cattle is not specified in the NRC [146].",1
"In addition, vitamin C may help to regulate adipogenesis.",1
Vitamin C increased preadipocyte growth of 3T3 L1 cells [148] and also had a positive effect on differentiation of sheep preadipocytes in primary culture [149].,1
A rumen-protected form of vitamin C is preferred as a dietary supplement because vitamin C is most likely degraded in the rumen [146].,1
Further study is necessary to clarify the effects of dietary vitamin C on MS and QG in other breeds of beef cattle.,1
"Fetal nutritional programming\nFetal programming or prenatal programing is the concept that mammalian embryonic and fetal development are linked to environmental changes, thus affecting the entire life [152].",1
The development of adipose tissue coincides with myogenesis during a particular time in fetal development [18].,1
"The gestation period is very important because it determines the fate of progenitor cells that will become muscle cells, fibroblasts, or adipocytes [16].",1
Nutritional manipulation of the fetus during gestation may affect animal performance and modify the quality and quantity of livestock products.,1
"Therefore, fetal nutritional programming via nutrition of dams during gestation may be one way to increase marbling in offspring later in life.",1
"Several studies have shown that fetal nutritional programming affects growth and/or beef quality, including marbling.",1
"For example, the effects of a 30% nutrient restriction in cows at early to mid-gestation on offspring (steers and heifers) growth and adiposity were tested in Angus×Gelbvieh [153].",1
"Adipocyte diameter in subcutaneous, mesenteric, and omental fat was larger in offspring of dams nutritionally restricted than in animals from dams with normal dietary intake (100% of NRC recommendations), but marbling data were not reported.",1
"In their study, YG was reduced, and HCW tended to be reduced in offspring of dams nutritionally restricted.",1
"In addition, nutritional restriction during early and mid gestation reduced ovarian characteristics (wet ovary weight, luteal tissue weight) of heifers, indicating negative effects of fetal programming on productive efficiency of replacement heifers.",1
This study indicates little or no effect of reduced maternal energy status during midgestation on offspring IMF deposition and muscle mass.,1
"Improving the nutritional condition of cows during pregnancy affects growth, fat deposition, and beef quality in steers; steers from cows grazing with better pasture (Thinopyrum–Elymus–Psathrystachus, CP 11.1% to 6.0%) during mid- to late gestation had greater live body weight at slaughter, HCW, and tenderness, and had an increased tendency for IMF deposition compared with offspring of cows grazing on native range (Bouteloua–Hesperostipa–Pascopyron, CP 6.5% to 5.4%) [155].",1
Effects of nutritional restriction from early gestation to parturition and/or throughout lactation on offspring growth and production characteristics to 30 mo of age and health and reproductive performance of cows were studied in large maternal grazing systems with offspring of Hereford cows mated to Piedmontese or Wagyu sires [33].,1
"However, the fetal programming did not significantly affect beef quality characteristics at 30 mo of age.",1
"In addition, authors emphasize importance of survival and health of cows and calves and of subsequent reproductive performance of cows for relative contribution of fetal programming to the profitability of beef production systems when developmental programming is applied [33].",1
"Radunz et al [156] tested the effects of three maternal late- gestational dietary energy sources (grass hay, corn, and dried corn distillers grains with solubles) on progeny postnatal growth and beef MS in an Angus cross-breed.",1
"The authors suggested that the prepartum maternal dietary energy source during late gestation can alter the development of fetal adipose tissue, affecting IMF deposition in progeny.",1
"However, studies during postnatal periods (after weaning or finishing period) show that feeding a high starch diet along with early weaning in steers generally increased marbling, as described above [51,53,157].",1
"Thus, the dietary energy source may differentially influence marbling and IMF deposition, depending on the feeding period.",1
"Overall, nutritional manipulation during the early, mid-, or late gestation period may affects adiposity or marbling of beef, but these effects are generally small and often masked by postnatal nutritional status, as mentioned by Bell and Greenwood [158].",1
"Further study is warranted to understand what mechanisms affect the adipogenic potential by nutritional modulation during the fetal period at specific gestation stages, thereafter affecting marbling and IMF deposition at the progeny slaughter stage.",1
Proper nutritional levels and proper selection of the types of energy sources for dams during each period of gestation stages may improve future production efficiency of progeny.,1
Some of the results presented above suggest restricted nutrition at certain stages of pregnancy has more favourable outcomes.,1
Bell and Greenwood [158] also suggest that effects of fetal programming during early-mid-gestation on postnatal growth or composition are generally minor.,1
"One of the mechanisms responsible for the effect of fetal nutritional programming on growth and adiposity of progeny is epigenetic modification (DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA) of gene expression during early development and permanent changes in offspring phenotypes in later life.",1
"Epigenetic modifications have been suggested to occur during development (fetal programming), growth, and fat deposition in cattle [13,18,159].",1
Our previous study showed the possible involvement of DNA methylation in regulating tissue-specific expression of PPARG gene in IMF and muscle of beef cattle [6].,1
"Thus, Korean and Japanese beef production systems have focused on production of highly marbled beef to satisfy their customers and to protect their beef industry against imported beef that has relatively low MS. As described above, several nutritional factors affect IMF deposition, and these factors must be considered to prepare a proper diet to improve marbling at the proper time in the life cycle.",1
"In addition, Japanese farmers generally restrict vitamin A levels in the diet during the mid-fattening stage to produce highly marbled Japanese Black cattle beef.",1
"Similarly, a growth stage-specific feeding system has generally been applied to Korean cattle to produce highly marbled beef.",1
The feeding strategy for highly marbled Korean cattle beef has been also described by Jo et al [96].,1
"CONCLUSION\nIn this article, we reviewed several factors (genetic, management, and nutritional factors) affecting IMF deposition in cattle (Table 2).",1
"IMF deposition can positively affect beef taste including tenderness and flavor, favoring highly marbled beef.",1
"This program has several limitations: the high proportion of concentrate in the diet and long fattening period (>30 months, especially in Korean cattle and Japanese Black cattle) may increase feed costs.",1
Excess energy supplied to mature animals during the late fattening period may significantly decrease feed efficiency.,1
"This may decrease digestibility of feed, increase animal feed waste, and eventually raise issues of animal industry sustainability.",1
"Current methods to increase IMF deposition are generally limited to increasing overall body fat deposition, including inedible fat.",1
"Further studies are needed to develop methods for producing highly marbled beef without increasing overall body fat deposition, including internal (abdominal, perirenal, mesenteric) and external (subcutaneous) inedible fat.",1
"In addition, high IMF deposition may negatively affect YG (or retail beef yield).",1
"Some sires may have high breeding value for both IMF and YG, and selection of such sires is likely to be beneficial for increasing IMF deposition without decreasing YG.",1
"Applying a single factor (e.g., nutritional or genetic) may not be adequate to increase IMF deposition.",1
"Development of new fusion technologies (e.g., nutrigenomics) with genetic, epigenetic, and nutritional factors may be more efficient to optimize IMF deposition and improve feed efficiency.",1
Nutritional programming during the fetal and neonatal periods has been suggested as a promising method to manipulate IMF deposition.,1
Further studies are warranted to test the feasibility of early nutritional programming for regulating IMF deposition in cattle.,1
"There has been increasing concerns by consumers about the negative impact of extremely highly marbled beef on human health, such as cardiovascular diseases and arteriosclerosis.",1
"Additional studies are warranted to produce beef with appropriate levels of IMF deposition to satisfy beef quality and taste, support human health, and sustain the animal industry, depending on the situation of each country.",1
"Effects of an antenatal dietary intervention in overweight and obese women on 6 month infant outcomes: follow-up from the LIMIT randomised trial\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nThe immediate impact of providing an antenatal dietary intervention during pregnancy has been extensively studied, but little is known of the effects beyond the neonatal period.",1
Our objective was to evaluate the effect of an antenatal dietary intervention in overweight or obese women on infant outcomes 6 months after birth.,1
"It is well recognised that a woman’s nutrition during pregnancy impacts pregnancy and birth outcomes, with the intra-uterine environment playing a key role in an individual’s later health and disease [3].",1
"Maternal obesity significantly predicts child and adult obesity in her offspring [4,5], and associated cardio-metabolic risk factors, including hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [6–8].",1
"Kitsantas and colleagues [9] report that maternal pre-gravid obesity increases the odds of pre-school obesity by a factor of 1.6 (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.26–2.03), while Rooney and colleagues [10] report a substantially greater increase in risk (RR 6.35; 95% CI 3.28–12.30).",1
"Exposure to such an intra-uterine environment potentially creates a vicious cycle in which the propensity to obesity is perpetuated, with major adverse public health implications [11,12], and implications for the health of successive generations [13].",1
There has been considerable research interest in the provision of antenatal dietary interventions during pregnancy to limit weight gain and improve pregnancy and birth outcomes for women and their infants.,1
"A comprehensive systematic review by Thangaratinam and colleagues [14] has identified numerous studies assessing dietary and lifestyle interventions in pregnancy, albeit mostly small in scope.",1
"While the findings reveal a relatively modest impact on weight gain [14], very little attention has been directed towards the ongoing follow-up of women and infants beyond the neonatal period to assess longer term outcomes.",1
"To our knowledge, only three randomised trials involving the provision of an antenatal dietary intervention [15–17] have conducted and reported findings of follow-up to 6 months after birth [18–20].",1
"However, these studies have been limited by the relatively low rates of assessment [18–20].",1
"Furthermore, studies have focussed predominantly on measures of adiposity, and have not reported other clinically relevant infant outcomes [18,20], or specifically reported infant outcomes among women who are overweight or obese [19].",1
"We have previously shown that a comprehensive dietary and lifestyle intervention during pregnancy, in women who are overweight or obese, significantly improves both maternal diet and physical activity [21], is associated with an 18 and 41% relative reduction in the risk of high infant birth weight above 4 and 4.5\u2009kg [22,23], and was a cost neutral intervention [24].",1
On-going participant follow-up is required to assess the further impact of these findings on childhood outcomes.,1
"This manuscript reports the effect of the LIMIT antenatal dietary intervention, on 6-month infant outcomes.",1
"Outcomes were additionally adjusted for maternal age, socioeconomic status and maternal smoking\nThere was no evidence to suggest that the effect of the antenatal intervention was modified by maternal BMI category for any of the reported outcomes (data not shown).",1
"The results, in terms of both direction and magnitude of effect, were consistent across all of these analyses.",1
"Discussion\nOur findings indicate that provision of an antenatal dietary intervention for overweight or obese women was not associated with effects on infant growth, measures of adiposity, and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 6 months of age.",1
There was no evidence to suggest that the effects of the intervention were modified by maternal BMI category.,1
A number of techniques have been described in the assessment of early infant body composition.,1
"Measurement of infant skinfold thickness [36,37] and bio-impedance are considered reliable and relatively non-invasive methods of assessing fat distribution, both of which have been correlated with more invasive measures [36,38–40].",1
"Furthermore, percentage fat, as determined by skinfold thickness measurements has been validated against DXA calculations of fat mass in both infants and children [36,41].",1
"Although these more detailed body composition assessment tools may have yielded more accurate estimates of the relative proportions of adipose and lean tissue mass, they were not considered feasible for use in the large scale setting required for this follow-up study, and its associated practical and financial constraints.",1
"While the use of a more sensitive test would provide more detailed and accurate estimates of early neurodevelopmental achievement, the ASQ has been validated against robust assessment tools [32], and in a paediatric population [33].",1
"Again, the resources and intensive psychology training required to administer, for example, the more complex Bayley Scale, while generating more detailed information, was not considered feasible in our study population.",1
"A potential limitation of our follow-up study is the risk of selection bias, with only 82% of the available cohort contributing data at 6-month follow-up assessments.",1
"We consider this risk, and the impact on the validity of our findings to be low.",1
"Our findings indicate no evidence of an effect of a comprehensive dietary and lifestyle intervention provided during pregnancy for women who are overweight or obese, on measures of infant growth, adiposity, and neurodevelopment at 6-months of age.",1
"This is despite our previously published findings of significant but modest improvements in maternal diet and physical activity during pregnancy [21], and an 18 and 41% relative reduction in risk of infant birth weight above 4 [22] and 4.5\u2009kg, respectively [23].",1
"While this may reflect evidence of a true lack of persisting effect of maternal dietary modification and birth weight on weight at 6-months of age, it may also be indicative that other factors are of relatively greater importance in driving early, ex-utero, infant growth and development.",1
Previous evidence on the longer-term effects of antenatal dietary and lifestyle interventions is limited.,1
"Although an assessment was conducted at 6 months post-partum involving 66% of participants [18], there have been no early infant outcomes reported to date.",1
"However, recently published findings from approximately 46% of eligible infants at 6 months of age (698 of 1522 eligible infants assessed) suggest a very small reduction in subscapular skinfold thickness measurement of ~0.4\u2009mm following provision of the antenatal intervention [20].",1
"While statistically significant, the clinical significance of such a small difference is questionable, the findings also consistent with a chance occurrence, particularly as this was a secondary outcome, and no other statistically significant differences were identified between the treatment groups in infant BMI, abdominal circumference, or the remainder of infant anthropometric measures obtained.",1
"There is emerging evidence, both from animal and human studies, of an association between maternal obesity and significantly higher risks of impaired offspring cognitive, motor and behavioural aspects of neurodevelopment [44–46].",1
"Children born to women who are overweight or obese are more likely to be identified with moderate to severe cognitive, motor and global developmental delay at 3 years of age [46], as well as poorer academic achievement extending to 14 years of age [44,45].",1
"Autism spectrum disorders in childhood have also been observed and diagnosed more frequently among children born to women with metabolic conditions identified during pregnancy, including diabetes and obesity [47].",1
"Our findings report, for the first time, the impact of an antenatal dietary intervention for women who are overweight or obese on early infant neurodevelopment.",1
"While we did not identify statistically or clinically significant differences in neurodevelopment at 6-months of age using a reliable screening tool, ongoing follow-up of participants further into childhood will again be important to determine whether there are any potential benefits of improving maternal diet and physical activity during pregnancy on childhood neurodevelopment.",1
"Despite this, it remains important to continue to follow-up the children whose mothers participated in this intervention trial, particularly in view of the well recognised association between high-infant birth weight and subsequent childhood obesity [48], and the emerging associations between maternal obesity and impaired childhood neurodevelopmental function [46].",1
"It will be valuable to utilise our clinical and biological databases to explore potential pathways whereby maternal obesity contributes to childhood outcomes, including obesity and impaired neurodevelopment.",1
"Nutrition during pregnancy and early development (NuPED) in urban South Africa: a study protocol for a prospective cohort\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nAdequate nutrition during pregnancy is important to ensure optimal birth outcomes, maternal health and offspring development.",1
"However, little is known about the dietary intake and nutritional status of pregnant women residing in urban South Africa.",1
"Therefore, the Nutrition during Pregnancy and Early Development (NuPED) cohort study was initiated to assess early nutrition-related exposures predictive of early childhood development in urban South Africa.",1
"Methods\nThe aims of this prospective cohort study are: 1) to assess dietary intake and nutritional status of urban pregnant women in Johannesburg, South Africa, and 2) to determine associations with birth outcomes, measures of maternal health, as well as measures of offspring health and development.",1
Discussion\nEnsuring adequate nutrition during pregnancy is one of the key actions endorsed by the South African Government to promote optimal early childhood development in an effort to eradicate poverty.,1
The results from this study may serve as a basis for the development of context-specific nutritional interventions which can improve birth outcomes and long-term quality of life of the mother and her offspring.,1
Background\nRecent estimates indicate that 250 million children in low- and middle income countries are at risk of not reaching their developmental potential [1].,1
"This is worrisome as suboptimal childhood development is associated with poorer adult health, well-being and productivity – leading to an intergenerational cycle of poverty.",1
"As the trajectories of physical and mental health later in life are determined fundamentally during the first 1000\xa0days of life, both the World Health Assembly Nutrition Targets and the Sustainable Developmental Goals call for action to, among others, improve maternal, infant and young child nutrition in an effort to ensure sustainable social and economic progress.",1
Maternal health and nutrition gained heightened attention three decades ago with the publication of the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis.,1
"Barker and Osmond [2] proposed that the cardiovascular disease they observed in an adult population from England and Wales was at least partly associated with poor early nutrition, and specifically undernutrition in utero [3].",1
"Undernourishment in utero can stress the foetus in ways that permanently affect physiological growth and development, and can be described as a reprogramming of the foetus’s developing phenotype [4].",1
"Several maternal nutritional factors have been investigated in relation to adverse pregnancy outcomes, as well as offspring health and development [7–9].",1
"The nutrients most studied during pregnancy include B-vitamins (particularly folic acid), vitamin D, iron, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (particularly n-3 fatty acids) and iodine [8,10].",1
"However, adequate maternal intakes of zinc and vitamin A may also be important for optimal pregnancy outcomes, as well as for maternal and offspring health [11–13].",1
"Furthermore, better overall diet quality has been associated with a lower risk for maternal perinatal depression and gestational weight gain, which in turn are risk factors for suboptimal offspring development [14–16].",1
The health of the adult South African population is a concern.,1
"The country is undergoing a rapid nutrition transition characterised by changes in dietary patterns and nutrient intake alongside urbanisation [19,20], which has resulted in a growing double-burden of under- and over-nutrition [20,21].",1
"The effects are also seen in children, with 27% of under-fives being stunted [22].",1
"Maternal short stature is, in turn, a risk factor for birth complications [24] – illustrating the intergenerational effect of poor nutrition.",1
Ensuring adequate nutrition during pregnancy is one of the key actions endorsed by the South African Government to promote optimal early childhood development in an effort to eradicate poverty [25].,1
"The Guidelines for maternity care in South Africa [26] therefore recommend routine nutritional assessment – such as measuring mid-upper arm circumference and haemoglobin levels – and daily supplementation of 200\xa0mg ferrous sulphate, 1000\xa0mg calcium and 5\xa0mg folic acid.",1
"However, studies show that the majority of South African women only seek or get access to public antenatal care in their second trimester of pregnancy [27–30], which might be too late for the routine supplementation programme or other interventions to be effective.",1
"Very little is known about the diet and nutritional status of pregnant women in South Africa, specifically residing in urban areas.",1
"Furthermore, understanding the associations of maternal diet and nutritional status during pregnancy with birth outcomes, as well as offspring health and development in the South African population will form the basis for the development of context-specific nutrition interventions that may improve birth outcomes and long-term quality of life of the mother and her offspring.",1
"Consequently, the Nutrition during Pregnancy and Early Development (NuPED) cohort study was initiated to investigate nutritional status during pregnancy and assess early nutrition-related exposures predictive of early childhood development in urban South Africa.",1
"Aims of the study\nThe aims of the NuPED study are 1) to assess dietary intake and nutritional status of urban pregnant women in Johannesburg, South Africa, and 2) to determine associations with birth outcomes, measures of maternal health, as well as measures of offspring health and development.",1
"Due to the high prevalence of HIV in the country (36% of women aged 30–34\xa0years [31]), their inclusion will make generalisation to the wider South African population a possibility.",1
It is important to note that in Johannesburg only 45% of women access ANC before 20\xa0weeks gestation and only 23% in their first trimester (as reported from other urban areas) [30].,1
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as a potential marker of neuronal growth and differentiation will be determined using ELISA [77].,1
"However, should the researchers be able to obtain additional funding, additional participants may be included.",1
"Discussion\nThe importance of perinatal nutrition and its role in offspring health, is recognised [79].",1
Nutrition during pregnancy is an important factor associated with both maternal and infant health outcomes [80].,1
"To date, however, South African public health nutrition interventions for pregnant women are limited to folic-iron and calcium supplementation, while it is highly likely that the diet of pregnant women living in South Africa is lacking vital micronutrients and essential fatty acids beyond those supplied, or is even containing excessive amounts of specific micro- and macro-nutrients.",1
"In order to advocate evidence-based healthcare policy and practice, the identification of nutrient deficiencies and poor eating patterns of pregnant women in South Africa, which are associated with adverse neonatal outcomes and delayed early offspring development, is imperative.",1
Little is known about the dietary behaviour and nutritional status of pregnant women living in South Africa.,1
"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first South African study focusing on the assessment of both maternal dietary intake and nutritional status in women pre- and postnatally and to investigate associations with outcomes of maternal and infant health.",1
This study is novel due to the comprehensive set of nutrition related data and indicators of maternal and infant health being obtained in a South African setting.,1
"Therefore, this explorative project will contribute to identifying factors that may be targeted in future pre- and/or post-conception maternal interventions for optimal offspring development and possibly reduction in adult NCD risk.",1
This study also has its challenges.,1
"South African statistics show that only 52% of women attend antenatal care before 20\xa0weeks’ gestation [30], thus access to women early in pregnancy is restricted and limits enrolment into the study.",1
"Furthermore, many healthcare facilities in Johannesburg serve a predominantly migrant population [81] posing a challenge for longitudinal data collection.",1
"Additionally, these women may choose to eat traditional foods [82] that do not form part of the South African Food Database for nutritional analysis; and may not be able to speak a local language [83] hampering detailed reporting during dietary assessments.",1
"Thus, migrating women or those unable to speak local languages could not be included in the study.",1
A limitation of the study is that women who fit the inclusion criteria are invited to join the study by visiting the data collection site at an agreed date.,1
Having this option of attending may contribute to self-selection bias.,1
Our recruitment data to date indicate that of those invited to take part in the study; only approximately 50% arrive at the data collection site on the booked date.,1
"Even so, this study will provide a comprehensive and unique database from an urban South African setting which will allow for cross-sectional, prospective and retrospective analyses to describe the nutritional status and dietary intake of pregnant women, and to determine associations with health outcome measures.",1
These results will supply context to intervention studies with the aim to improve maternal as well as offspring health in South Africa.,1
"[""Developmental Perspectives on Nutrition and Obesity From Gestation to Adolescence\n\nAbstract:KEY-POINTS\nObesity results from a complex combination of factors that act at many stages throughout a person's life.""]",1
"Therefore, examining childhood nutrition and obesity from a developmental perspective is warranted.",1
"A developmental perspective recognizes the cumulative effects of factors that contribute to eating behavior and obesity, including biological and socioenvironmental factors that are relevant at different stages of development.",1
"A developmental perspective considers family, school, and community context.",1
"During gestation, risk factors for obesity include maternal diet, overweight, and smoking.",1
"In early childhood, feeding practices, taste acquisition, and eating in the absence of hunger must be considered.",1
"As children become more independent during middle childhood and adolescence, school nutrition, food marketing, and social networks become focal points for obesity prevention or intervention.",1
Combining a multilevel approach with a developmental perspective can inform more effective and sustainable strategies for obesity prevention.,1
"[""Introduction\nObesity results from a combination of factors that occur at different stages during a person's lifetime.""]",1
"Therefore, childhood nutrition and obesity should be examined from a developmental perspective.",1
"First, prenatal and early life experiences influence the trajectory of weight into adulthood (1).",1
"Second, during certain critical periods, vulnerabilities are intensified to specific maternal and environmental exposures that can lead to obesity (2).",1
"Finally, the cumulative effects of multiple factors contribute to eating behavior and obesity (3).",1
"Growing evidence suggests that prenatal and maternal interactions and influences must be considered along with biological and environmental variables throughout infancy, childhood, and adolescence that may lead to — or prevent — obesity.",1
"Examining nutrition and obesity from a developmental perspective combines social context and biological influences with individual behavior (4,5).",1
We describe where these contexts interact with biological processes to affect food behavior and obesity.,1
"Although a person is at risk for obesity throughout his life, we focus on specific developmental susceptibilities for obesity from gestation through adolescence (Table).",1
Gestational Period\nRisk for obesity and metabolic disorders begins during gestation (1).,1
"Obesity is linked to in utero exposure to glucocorticoids, protein restrictions, and maternal diet and obesity.",1
Male offspring of female rats with a history of fetal exposure to glucocorticoids also exhibit low birth weight and glucose intolerance — a multigenerational effect (6).,1
"Feeding low-protein diets to pregnant rats produces a broad spectrum of disorders in their offspring (7): hypertension and vascular defects (8,9), altered fetal pancreatic development and structure (10), altered glucose tolerance (11), altered liver structure and function (12), altered gene expression (13), and possibly type 2 diabetes mellitus (10).",1
"In humans, low protein intake by women in late pregnancy has been associated with low birth weight, a marker of risk for obesity and other metabolic disorders later in life (14).",1
"Female rat pups born to and suckled by fat-fed mothers have high blood pressure, even after being placed on a balanced diet after weaning.",1
Such changes in early life are likely to lead to metabolic syndrome in adult animals (15).,1
"[""Many studies have indicated a link between smoking during pregnancy and the offspring's subsequent obesity, but the underlying mechanism has not been established.""]",1
"Children born to women who smoke during pregnancy typically weigh less at birth, and they often have a catch-up period during their first year, although studies have not consistently found a link between catch-up growth and greater childhood body mass index (BMI).",1
"Other hypotheses postulate mechanisms such as poor placental blood supply because of nicotine-induced vasoconstriction, poor maternal nutrition, and fetal exposure to carbon monoxide.",1
"[""Whatever the mechanism, the relationship between smoking during pregnancy and children's overweight is well documented (16,17)\nIn 1 study, for example, babies born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy weighed less than did babies born to nonsmokers (18).""]",1
"However, as they reached adolescence (age 11 years for girls, 16 for boys), children exposed to tobacco in utero had a significantly greater risk of being in the highest 10% of BMI for their age group.",1
"This tendency continued to strengthen with age (participants were followed through age 33) and could not be explained by other factors in their childhood, adolescence, or adulthood (18).",1
A recent 27-year study of children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy found larger annual changes in cholesterol levels; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased more than in children not exposed to tobacco in utero.,1
This was the first study to suggest that smoking during pregnancy is linked to adverse changes in the lipoprotein levels of children (19).,1
"In an analysis of questionnaire data from 8,765 children aged 5 to 7 years, smoking after pregnancy was not associated with childhood obesity but intrauterine exposure was (20).",1
Another study found that smoking during the 12 months before birth of a child was associated with adolescent overweight (21).,1
Studies have found a significant association between maternal prepregnancy overweight or obesity and overweight in children.,1
"This association indicates that overweight mothers are more likely to have overweight children, and these odds increase with the age of the child.",1
"For children aged 24 to 47 months, only maternal prepregnancy obesity had a significant effect; for children aged 48 to 71 months, either maternal prepregnancy overweight or obesity increased risk; and in children aged 72 to 95 months, maternal overweight or obesity imparted an even higher risk (21,22).",1
"[""Breast-feeding reduced the likelihood of early adolescent overweight in children whose mothers' prepregnancy BMI was 25 or higher, although the effect of breast-feeding was not significant in children of healthy-weight mothers (21,22).""]",1
"Thus, both prenatal and maternal variables can increase the risk of obesity in even the youngest children, long before social factors have an influence.",1
"Obesity prevention efforts at this stage of development have typically focused on encouraging healthy prenatal nutrition and breast-feeding; however, interventions to reduce maternal obesity during pregnancy have been limited.",1
Infancy and Early Childhood\n\nTaste acquisition and preference\nThe biological substrate that underlies the taste and rewarding properties of foods is relevant because the best predictor of food preference is whether a child likes the taste (23).,1
"Whether a food tastes good or bad and the pleasure of eating is a complex process mediated by chemical senses in the periphery and multiple brain substrates, which are remarkably well conserved phylogenetically (24).",1
"The small number of taste qualities may have evolved because of the functional importance of the primary stimuli (eg, sugars, sodium chloride, bitter toxins) in nutrient selection, especially in children.",1
"The heightened preference for sweet taste, which is evident within hours after birth and persists until adolescence (27,28) most likely evolved because sweet-tasting foods are high in energy.",1
"[""Children's heightened preference for salty tastes (29) attracts them to necessary minerals, and rejecting bitter-tasting substances protects them from poisons because most poisonous compounds taste bitter (30).""]",1
"However, although bitter tastes are innately disliked, with repeated exposure, infants can come to like certain foods that are bitter, particularly some vegetables (31-34).",1
"The 2002 Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study, designed to update knowledge on the feeding patterns of the youngest Americans, found that even before their second birthday, many American toddlers develop the unhealthy eating habits of adults (35).",1
"Although toddlers were more likely to eat fruits than vegetables, 1 in 4 did not eat any vegetables on a given day.",1
"Instead, like older children, they were more likely to eat fatty foods such as french fries, salty snacks, and sweet beverages and less likely to eat bitter-tasting vegetables (36,37).",1
"Our knowledge is growing of how, beginning very early in life, early sensory experience can shape and modify flavor and food preferences.",1
"[""For example, fetuses exposed to flavors, usually detected by the sense of smell, in amniotic fluid and infants exposed to flavors in breast milk (both of which reflect flavors of the mother's diet) (38) learn to like those flavors as they make the transition to eating adult foods (39).""]",1
"[""The foods that women eat when they are pregnant and nursing are precisely the ones that their infants should prefer because the mothers' eating them teaches the child that these foods are available, safe, and nutritious.""]",1
"At this time, however, how the protective factor of breast-feeding interacts with transmitting flavor preference for energy-dense foods in overweight mothers is unclear.",1
These sensory and biological considerations shed light on why lifestyle changes are difficult for young children to make.,1
The first emotional attachment to flavors should be exploited to try to reduce the prevalence of obesity in future generations.,1
"For this reason, preventive interventions may be most effective during pregnancy and postpartum, when women are highly motivated to change for the benefit of their children.",1
Pregnant and lactating women should widen their food choices to include as many flavorful and healthy foods as possible.,1
"These experiences, combined with repeated exposure to nutritious foods and flavor variety (31-34), should make children more likely to choose a healthy diet.",1
"Eating in the absence of hunger\nInfants (40,41) and young children (42,43) can adjust their food intake in response to changes in the caloric content of their diet, and biological sensations involving appetite probably underlie this ability.",1
"This ability has been documented at meals (42,43) and during the course of a day (44).",1
"The complex interaction of nature and nurture in the regulation of appetite (45) is exemplified by a behavior known as eating in the absence of hunger (EAH), a behavioral marker of impaired satiety (46-49).",1
"Children ranging in age from 3 (50) to 19 years (51) have been observed in laboratory settings to eat large amounts of palatable food in the absence of hunger, after a meal.",1
The amount of energy consumed in the absence of hunger is variable and related to child weight.,1
"EAH is seen more often in children who are overweight (39,47,49,52) and in children with higher 1-year weight gains (53).",1
This behavior is analogous to external (53) or disinhibited (54) eating behavior in adults.,1
"Genes influence many aspects of eating behavior, including taste sensitivity (55), food preference (56), intake of specific foods (57), meal patterns (58), energy density (59), macronutrient intake (60,61), and meal (61-63) and daily energy intake (61).",1
"Behaviors such as EAH may also be heritable (64), although evidence is limited.",1
"Genetic influences on EAH (49,65) and other eating behaviors such as emotional eating (66) are supported by findings that the behavior is more common when 1 or both parents are overweight, even after certain environmental factors (eg, parental eating habits) have been controlled for.",1
"Evidence for genetic influence on intake regulation is also reflected in the relative stability of behaviors like EAH within people during 2- to 6-year periods in childhood (47,67).",1
The biological underpinnings of EAH and other appetite-related behaviors are not well understood.,1
"EAH in children is associated with higher fasting insulin and leptin levels (64), 2 hormones that regulate appetite and body weight (68).",1
"Satiety responsiveness, a separate dimension of child intake regulation, has recently been linked to variations in the FTO gene (69), which confers obesity risk and is highly expressed in the hypothalamus, a center of appetite regulation in the brain.",1
"Similar to other aspects of appetite regulation (70,71), EAH appears to become more problematic throughout childhood (45,72).",1
"Though the causes are not known, socioenvironmental influences contribute to developmental shifts in intake regulation by overriding biologically based cues of hunger and satiety.",1
"Factors that modify intake regulation include the types and amounts of food to which children are exposed, social modeling of eating behaviors, and child feeding styles and practices (73).",1
"For instance, experimental research has demonstrated social modeling influences on both the types (74) and amounts of food eaten by young children (75-77).",1
"[""Studies of EAH among girls have shown positive associations with mothers' but not fathers' disinhibited eating (52,65).""]",1
"EAH has also been associated with restrictive feeding practices, although not consistently.",1
"[""Restricting children's access to a preferred food has been associated with higher levels of EAH in girls aged 3 to 5 years (49,78) and in non-Hispanic white girls aged 5 to 9 years (47,72,79).""]",1
"[""Laboratory studies of preschool-aged children have also demonstrated that restrictions placed on children's access to palatable, energy-dense foods can lead to increased food intake when restrictions are lifted and food becomes available (80,81).""]",1
"Other studies, however, found no link between feeding restriction and EAH (54).",1
"In many ways, inconsistencies in the literature on EAH parallel those observed in the general literature on child feeding, which may reflect the early stage of the work in the field.",1
"[""Knowledge of child feeding has largely evolved from laboratory studies that address cause and effect but provide limited insight on the usual environments and social interactions surrounding children's behavior.""]",1
"[""The approach parents take to feeding their children reflects their goals for their children's eating and health, and these goals are influenced by culture and socioeconomic status (82).""]",1
"[""To some extent, the effect of child feeding practices on children's health requires careful consideration of context.""]",1
Middle Childhood\nAnother critical period for the development of obesity is during middle childhood.,1
"BMI tends to decrease during early childhood and then, typically between the ages of 6 and 8, begins to rise again (adiposity rebound).",1
Excessive rebound and early rebound (before age 5) are related to higher BMI in adulthood (83).,1
"[""An early rebound may reflect the child's taking more control of intake, exposure to gestational diabetes, or early maturation (84).""]",1
"[""Children's patterns of weight gain vary by sex and age (85), and during stages of rapid growth, caloric requirements increase.""]",1
These stages are opportunities for interventions to prevent obesity by controlling caloric intake and increasing energy expenditure.,1
"In addition, because the prevalence of obesity increases among children after puberty, as the age of sexual maturity decreases in the population (86) obesity will probably become more prevalent among elementary school students.",1
Children of school age are highly susceptible to environmental stimuli such as marketing and food availability.,1
Studies suggest that children who are exposed to food advertisements eat more.,1
"[""Several studies of advertising on children's television programs found that the foods promoted increased the risk of becoming obese.""]",1
"[""In 1 study, at least half of food advertisements during children's television programming were for energy-dense, low-nutrient foods such as cereal, candy, snacks, soda, and fast food (87).""]",1
"Not only do such advertisements promote eating, but eating while watching television also often leads to overeating because children do not notice how much they are eating (88).",1
"A recent study showed that for each hour of television watched, children consumed an extra 167 kcal/d (89).",1
"This susceptibility is mainly because decision making, critical thinking, and abstract thinking are underdeveloped in childhood.",1
"Exposure to advertisements would decrease by restricting food advertisements that target children, especially during times, such as Saturday mornings, when many children are watching television (87).",1
"[""The school environment is an opportunity for study and intervention in children's health behaviors because multiple factors can influence obesity in this context.""]",1
"For example, the Coordinated School Health Program model from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention proposes a multilevel approach in which 8 different school components (eg, health education, nutrition services, healthy school environment, family and community involvement) interact to influence student health (91).",1
"[""Few studies of school eating patterns have focused on kindergarten and early elementary years, but in third grade, school lunch choices begin to influence children's overall diets (92).""]",1
"[""Schools' food policies affect student BMI; in 1 study, as the number of school food policies increased, students' mean BMI decreased (93).""]",1
The US educational system has typically fallen short in considering health a priority for academic emphasis or outcomes.,1
"Health outcomes must be included in the educational agenda and become part of school accountability to obtain support and funding for health-based policies and interventions, such as physical education, comprehensive health education, or BMI monitoring.",1
"A survey of the 100 largest school districts in 2006 found that, among the local wellness policies implemented, 99% dealt with nutrition standards of school meals, 97% required nutrition education for at least some grades, and 65% set standards for when teachers can use food to reward children for good behavior or academic accomplishments (94).",1
"School programs intended to alleviate the obesity crisis need funding, partnerships, and evaluation.",1
"[""In 2007, the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario set forth school policies that would prevent childhood obesity; these policies included promoting physical education classes for all students, requiring physical education specialists to be involved in physical education classes, selling healthy foods in cafeterias and vending machines, and promoting walking or biking to and from school (95).""]",1
"Adolescence\nIn addition to developmental risks carried from earlier life, by adolescence the cumulative effects of social disadvantage on obesity become apparent.",1
Analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Child-Mother File found that having an unmarried mother increased the risk for adolescent overweight.,1
"Education and current income were not significantly associated with adolescent overweight, and lifetime income was only marginally significant (21).",1
The Growing Up Today Study found that subjective social status in the school environment predicted BMI in adolescent girls (96).,1
Girls who ranked themselves at the low end of school social status were 69% more likely to have a BMI 2 kg/m2higher than that of girls of higher subjective social status.,1
The authors concluded that higher subjective social standing in school might protect against weight gain in adolescent girls.,1
The feedback loop in which low self-esteem increases the risk of overweight and overweight contributes to low self-esteem could be a critical point of intervention.,1
"[""An analysis of data from 12,067 people in the Framingham Heart Study revealed an association between people's weight gain and weight gain in their social networks (97).""]",1
"Rather than occurring randomly throughout social networks, people with BMI ≥30 kg/m2were clustered in the 32-year data set.",1
This finding was not explained solely by social ties between people who were already obese.,1
"The chance of becoming obese during a given period increased with development of obesity in a friend (57% increase), a sibling (40% increase), or a spouse (37% increase).",1
The effect was stronger between same-sex friends and siblings.,1
"This association did not extend to neighbors, nor was it associated with changes in smoking behavior.",1
A more recent study examined the peer effects on adolescent BMI by using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (98).,1
"This study found an effect of social networks on obesity in adolescents, and the effect was more pronounced among girls and heavier adolescents.",1
Social networks seem to play a role in the spread of obesity in both adults and adolescents.,1
"Therefore, programs that target peer norms may be effective in preventing overweight in adolescents.",1
Cognitive development during adolescence should also be considered.,1
"Although the developmental stage of formal operational thought enables skills such as enhanced problem solving, decision making, and abstract reasoning (90), the underdeveloped prefrontal cortex (99) still leaves adolescents at risk for behaviors that may increase the risk of obesity.",1
"For example, adolescents tend to be prone to impulsivity and the fallacy of invincibility and to have problems considering long-term consequences of their behavior.",1
These factors can contribute to poor judgment when it comes to food selection and other health-related behaviors.,1
"Conclusions\nTraditional interventions for child and adolescent obesity often focus on the individual child, with or without family involvement, and include education, modification of diet, and increases in physical activity.",1
"Cognitive behavioral strategies are often used to help children make better decisions, solve problems, and monitor their own progress.",1
"A recent movement suggests minimizing screen time for youth because television, computers, and video games contribute to sedentary behavior.",1
"However, few obesity interventions show clinically or statistically significant weight loss beyond the intervention period (100), which suggests that new and more comprehensive interventions are needed.",1
"To counteract the growing incidence of obesity, interventions must adopt an approach that grasps the interplay of economic, social, behavioral, biomedical, and environmental influences.",1
"[""Such an approach would have to encompass emerging knowledge about how obesity is the consequence of complex factors acting at many stages throughout a person's lifetime.""]",1
"The challenge of intervening in the obesity epidemic becomes even more daunting with the realization that, in children and adolescents, these influences must be considered separately at each stage of development.",1
This overview of the developmental influences on childhood overweight and obesity suggests opportunities for intervention.,1
"To combat prenatal influences on child obesity, pregnant women should be strongly discouraged from smoking and encouraged to consume a diet low in fat with adequate protein.",1
"Additionally, breast-feeding may decrease the risk of overweight, particularly in children born to overweight mothers.",1
"Because women are more motivated to change behaviors during pregnancy and immediately postpartum, these intervals can be targeted to shape eating patterns of both mother and child.",1
"Interventions to prevent child and adolescent obesity should focus on multiple settings, including the home and school.",1
"Further research should investigate variables in family relationships, the home, and the extended environment that influence eating.",1
Schools can intervene by offering healthy food choices in their breakfast and lunch programs and vending machines.,1
Empowering families and schools and giving them resources to engage in obesity prevention efforts and to provide environments that support healthy behaviors are critical issues that governments and social institutions need to address.,1
"Pre- and Postnatal Nutritional Histories Influence Reproductive Maturation and Ovarian Function in the Rat\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nWhile prepubertal nutritional influences appear to play a role in sexual maturation, there is a need to clarify the potential contributions of maternal and childhood influences in setting the tempo of reproductive maturation.",1
In the present study we employed an established model of nutritional programming to evaluate the relative influences of prenatal and postnatal nutrition on growth and ovarian function in female offspring.,1
"[""Results\nWe report that in the female rat, pubertal timing and subsequent ovarian function is influenced by the animal's nutritional status in utero , with both maternal caloric restriction and maternal high fat nutrition resulting in early pubertal onset.""]",1
"[""Depending on the offspring's nutritional history during the prenatal and lactational periods, subsequent nutrition and body weight gain did not further influence offspring reproductive tempo, which was dominated by the effect of prenatal nutrition.""]",1
"Whereas maternal calorie restriction leads to early pubertal onset, it also leads to a reduction in adult progesterone levels later in life.",1
"In contrast, we found that maternal high fat feeding which also induces early maturation in offspring was associated with elevated progesterone concentrations.",1
Conclusions\nThese observations are suggestive of two distinct developmental pathways leading to the acceleration of pubertal timing but with different consequences for ovarian function.,1
We suggest different adaptive explanations for these pathways and for their relationship to altered metabolic homeostasis.,1
"Introduction\nThe past century has seen a dramatic decline in the age of menarche: in Europe the age of menarche has fallen from 17 to ∼12.5 years of age[1]–[5], although the rate of decline is slowing[6],[7].",1
"This fall is usually attributed to improvements in child health and nutrition since the early 19thcentury, when the age of menarche was highest.",1
"This led to the hypothesis that the age of menarche is directly linked to a critical degree of body fat[8]; however although prepubertal nutrition and the age of puberty are certainly associated in some way, this concept did not stand up to critical analysis of the data[9].",1
"Data in humans suggest the possibility that complex interactions between prenatal and postnatal events influence the timing of puberty within one generation[2],[10],[11].",1
"In the 1948 UK birth cohort, both being born smaller and accelerated weight gain in childhood led to independent and interactive effects on the age of menarche[12], and we have recently confirmed this observation in an Australian cohort[13].",1
"Opposing influences of prenatal and postnatal growth have previously been described for adrenarche[14], central fat distribution[15]and insulin sensitivity at age 8 years[16].",1
"In data derived from adoption studies[17],[18], young girls who migrated from underprivileged countries to developed countries entered puberty significantly earlier than girls who remained in their country of origin[19],[20], and in unrelated studies such children have shown persistent differences in ovarian function later in life[11].",1
"It has been argued that the effects of intrauterine cues such as prenatal undernutrition on later metabolic function have an adaptive origin[21], in that they are a result of evolved processes designed to maintain reproductive fitness across a range of potential environments.",1
"[22]have proposed that the fetus uses nutritional signals (and/or changes in the endocrine environment) to anticipate its future energetic environment, and through developmental plasticity adjusts its phenotype accordingly[23],[24].",1
"[""In this regard, developmental plasticity would confer a phenotype that is better suited for the environment and thereby increase the organism's chances of reproducing successfully.""]",1
"Life history theory links earlier ages of maturation to ecological circumstances including energy availability, risks of predation and other causes of extrinsic mortality[25].",1
"Part of an adaptive response to early life nutritional challenge might therefore be expected to be an acceleration in the age of reproductive maturation, provided that the organism can metabolically sustain earlier reproduction without further compromising its own viability.",1
"In general, life history concepts suggest that poor nutrition or threatening circumstances in early life lead to accelerated maturation, through which the organism trades body size and longevity for earlier reproduction in a threatening environment[26].",1
"There are a wealth of data showing that in the rat, compromising early life signals such as maternal undernutrition or glucocorticoid exposure lead to offspring that develop a deleterious metabolic phenotype; including obesity, with both peripheral components such as sarcopenia and insulin resistance, and central components including hyperphagia, a preference for fatty foods and altered willingness to exercise[27]–[29].",1
"More recently, the effects of relative ‘overnutrition’ have come into question.",1
"Of current concern in developed countries are the rising rates of obesity[30]and gestational diabetes, both of which produce offspring who develop obesity[31]–[35].",1
"While it has been suggested that body fat and therefore childhood nutrition per se play a direct role in determining the age of pubertal onset[36],[37], the effects of an intrauterine obesogenic environment have not been considered.",1
"The overall aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of differing nutritional exposures (standard rat chow, high fat or caloric restriction) during intrauterine and early postnatal life on pubertal onset and ovarian function in female rat offspring.",1
"Additionally, we investigated whether a lifetime of high fat consumption by the dam has differing effects compared to high fat consumption that is restricted to pregnancy and lactation.",1
"We evaluated growth, timing of reproductive maturation and adult ovarian function.",1
"We report that early life caloric restriction, either before birth or during lactation, consistently accelerates the age of maturation.",1
"Although we report that the combination of prenatal caloric restriction and postnatal high fat nutrition also advanced the age at puberty, this was not directly linked to body weight at puberty.",1
"Intriguingly, maternal high fat consumption also accelerated reproductive maturation in female offspring, but here a post-weaning high fat diet had limited additional effect.",1
"We also present data indicating that these two early life nutritional exposures had differential effects on later life ovarian function, suggestive of two developmental pathways that affect the tempo of reproductive maturation in the rat.",1
"Comparatively, maternal high fat nutrition led to a small but significant (p<0.05) reduction in birth weight compared to Cont (Figure 1B).",1
There was a further significant (p<0.05) reduction in birth weight of female offspring born to PLHF dams compared to MHF and Cont offspring.,1
"In contrast to calorie restricted offspring, these pups regained their weight and by day 12 (MHF) or day 14 (PLHF) surpassed controls in both weight and rate of weight gain, reflective of a significantly altered growth trajectory (Figure 1D).",1
Pubertal onset and adult ovarian function is dependent on maternal nutritional background\n\nPubertal onset in control offspring\nPubertal age of offspring born to control dams was similar to that reported previously[38].,1
"Maternal nutrient restriction during pregnancy and/or lactation significantly advanced pubertal age in female offspring to a similar degree (p<0.01,figure 2A;Table 1).",1
"In calorie restricted offspring (UNP, UNL, UNPL), a post-weaning HF diet further advanced the age at puberty (p<0.001;Figure 2B, C, D;Table 1) compared to those offspring who were normally nourished in utero and fed a HF diet post-weaning (Table 1).10.1371/journal.pone.0006744.g002\n\nCaption (FIG): FIGURE 2\nPercentage of offspring entering puberty over time in animals whose dams received 50% of normal nutrition.",1
"A post-weaning HF diet significantly increased progesterone concentrations in Cont and UN animals (p<0.05,Figure 4C), although in UNL offspring these differences did not reach statistical significance.",1
"Maternal consumption of a HF diet resulted in adult offspring progesterone concentrations that were significantly higher than those of offspring born to Cont dams (p<0.05;Figure 4B), although in MHF offspring these differences did not reach statistical significance.",1
Weight at puberty\nOffspring that were exposed to altered maternal nutrition (either maternal undernutrition or high fat diet) all showed significantly lower body weights at pubertal onset compared to Cont offspring (p<0.05;Table 1).,1
"Discussion\nThese data demonstrate that intrauterine, lactational and post-weaning nutritional histories make differential contributions to the age of puberty in the female rat, and lead to persistent effects on ovarian function extending into adulthood.",1
"While a post-weaning high fat diet had the effect of accelerating puberty, this was restricted to only those offspring of control dams or those born to dams that were calorie restricted, and in calorie restricted offspring this effect was relatively small compared to that of early life nutrition.",1
"Maternal undernutrition\nFetal growth restriction as a consequence of impaired intrauterine conditions can be interpreted as part of a life history strategy in which the organism anticipates a shorter life because of a higher risk of extrinsic mortality, and therefore invests less into growth but accelerates maturation to ensure reproductive fitness[10],[36],[39]–[41].",1
"Consistent with this, we observed that both prenatal and lactational undernutrition accelerated puberty – although only the former was accompanied by the later development of obesity and other components of metabolic compromise, as previously reported[29].",1
"The shift towards an earlier puberty may represent a life course strategy[10]intended to preserve fitness[36],[41]by reducing the risk of death before reproducing, or by allowing a greater number of successful reproductive episodes before death.",1
We speculate that the well reported phenomenon of metabolic programming as a result of poor prenatal nutrition might be a secondary outcome of a life history strategy to accelerate maturation.,1
"A fitness advantage would be obtained only if there were sufficient nutrient stores to support earlier reproduction, and an integrated adaptive response would thus require both accelerated puberty and altered metabolism.",1
"However, an accelerated reproductive tempo may not be maintained in the face of later nutritional constraints.",1
"There may be a postnatal override such that if energetics remain poor during postnatal life, reproductive maturation may be delayed until the nutritional environment is improved sufficiently to support a first pregnancy.",1
"Using a similar experimental paradigm, we have previously demonstrated that prenatal undernutrition in a rodent model was associated with a prepubertal increase in food intake[29]and alterations in epigenetic regulation of and mRNA levels of hepatic genes to favour lipogenesis[42].",1
"Taken together, our observations could suggest that the prenatal undernutrition-induced acceleration in pubertal onset observed in the present study may contribute to a significant drive to alter metabolic capacity.",1
"These data therefore may be consistent with clinical observations that that lower but normal birth weight followed by accelerated weight gain up to age 8 is associated with earlier menarche[12],[13].",1
Mechanisms regulating pubertal onset are no doubt multifactorial.,1
"Leptin is a permissive neuro-regulatory factor for the onset of puberty[43],[44].",1
"It synchronizes growth and fertility with periods of either adequate or inadequate food availability[45]; post-weaning treatment with leptin accelerates puberty in rodents[46],[47], and leptin in the rat neonate affects hypothalamic maturation[48].",1
"Since in the present study neonatal growth trajectories in pups that were exposed to maternal undernutrition began to deviate from those of control pups at a time that coincides with a neonatal surge in circulating leptin concentrations, which itself is nutritionally influenced[49],[50], leptin may be a central driver in initiating maturational changes.",1
This is consistent with our previous observations that these offspring have altered leptin regulation and are hyperleptinemic as adults[51].,1
"Indeed those offspring, for which maternal calorie restriction was extended into lactation, did not show obesity as adults, but still displayed accelerated reproductive maturation.",1
"The observation that lactational undernutrition can lead to a modification of the adult metabolic phenotype is compatible with work by others showing that postnatal undernutrition can modify metabolic programming[52],[53].",1
It does appear however that such modification does not reverse the altered tempo of reproductive maturation in programmed offspring.,1
"Using a life-history interpretation, adaptive developmental responses to environmental cues may be graded; according to the severity of the stress experienced[22],[54]–[56].",1
The differing outcomes between each of the perinatal undernutrition approaches reported here are likely to reflect these confounders of severity and timing.,1
Maternal high fat exposure\nWe found that exposure to a high fat diet either throughout the lifetime of the mother or restricted to pregnancy and/or lactation led to early pubertal onset.,1
These findings are compatible with a previous report of early puberty following high fat nutrition during pregnancy[57].,1
"High fat perinatal nutrition advanced the age at puberty to the same degree as did post-weaning high fat nutrition in control offspring, and intriguingly the addition of a high fat postnatal diet following high fat prenatal nutrition had no further effect on pubertal age.",1
"Therefore, nutritionally-induced accelerated reproductive maturation following high fat exposure may not be limited to one distinct critical developmental window.",1
"In our model, early life signals of high fat nutritional conditions led to accelerated maturation.",1
"We have previously shown that offspring of dams fed a high fat diet throughout life (including during pregnancy and lactation) show accelerated weight gain in postnatal life, independent of postnatal diet[58].",1
"In the present study, offspring of nutritionally challenged dams develop obesity; thus a perpetuation and possibly a compounding of accelerated pubertal onset may ensue in the next generation as these offspring will themselves be fatter at an earlier reproductive age.",1
"Ovarian function\nMaternal exposure to either caloric restriction or to high fat nutrition was associated with accelerated puberty in female offspring, but there were distinct differences in mature ovarian function as measured by progesterone concentrations in the proestrous phase.",1
"The study design did not allow for a direct measure of reproductive performance, however, high salivary progesterone concentrations in women is associated with greater ovulation rates and ovulatory events are associated with childhood and adult environmental and ecological factors[58].",1
"Although we did not measure reproductive performance, we speculate that the higher progesterone concentrations observed may be associated with better functioning of the corpora lutea.",1
We recognise however that the influence of central gonadal drivers cannot be discounted.,1
"In contrast to MHF and PLHF offspring, those born to dams that were undernourished during pregnancy showed lower adult circulating progesterone concentrations.",1
"In life history terms, the trade-off for those born to dams undernourished during pregnancy may be an earlier maturation but a faster decline in ovarian function with aging, associated with significantly reduced adult progesterone levels.",1
"There are data that suggest that at least in mice, aging per se may be accelerated in offspring of poorly nourished dams.",1
"[59]have reported that prenatal undernutrition, in contrast to postnatal undernutrition, leads to reduced longevity in mice.",1
"In our study, while puberty was accelerated in maternal high fat exposed offspring, ovarian function was maintained or enhanced into adult life.",1
"We speculate that whereas pubertal onset was accelerated in the UNP group to maintain some potential for reproduction in an environment predicted to have a higher mortality risk, in the HF offspring maturation was accelerated to opportunistically enhance fitness.",1
"Finally, while the use of rodent models for reproductive investigation is generally well accepted, a number of differences must be recognized.",1
"Rodents for instance have short reproductive cycles closely linked with circadian rhythms, and do not experience menses or true “menopause” as a result of follicular depletion as typically observed in humans, although follicular depletion does occur.",1
"Although we accept that rodents and humans may differ in their adaptive responses to early life cues, there are many reports outlining associations between a suboptimal early life environment and altered phenotype in both species[60],[61].",1
"Conclusions\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that in the rat, pre- and postnatal nutritional histories together influence both ovarian function and the tempo of reproductive maturation in female offspring.",1
"In our study, both maternal high fat nutrition and diminished maternal calorie intake impacted on female offspring reproductive maturation resulting in early pubertal onset, most likely through two different, potentially adaptive, pathways.",1
"We speculate that our findings may imply adaptive responses to early life cues predicted by a life-history approach, although confirmation of these predictions requires further studies to assess reproductive fitness.",1
Future studies will elucidate the long term effects of maternal nutrition on offspring reproductive capability and to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying early pubertal onset.,1
"On the aetiology of autism\nI have suggested that the primary environmental trigger for autism is not vaccinations, toxins or infections, but gestational and early childhood vitamin D deficiency (1,2).",1
"Subsequently, the title of an article in Scientific American recently asked, ‘What if vitamin D deficiency is a cause of autism?’ (3) Since then, an article on vitamin D and autism in Acta Paediatrica (4) and the accompanying commentary (5) have added to the accelerating suspicion that vitamin D deficiency – either during pregnancy or early childhood – may be an environmental trigger for the genetic disease of autism.",1
"Instead, I concentrate on papers either published since my paper, or on evidence I overlooked when researching the original paper.",1
"Finally, I explain my reasons why this theory deserves immediate attempts to disprove it.",1
"Simultaneous with the above two Acta Paediatrica publications, a paper elsewhere reported that among 117 adult psychiatric outpatients is Sweden with various diagnoses, the 10 patients with autism had the lowest vitamin D levels of any of the groups studied, a mean of 12 ng/mL (31 nM), approaching the osteomalacic range for adults and the rachitic range for children (6).",1
"Even more interesting, some of the patients seemed to improve when treated with an average dose of about 4000 IU of vitamin D/day.",1
The authors did not say if the improvement occurred in the autism group.,1
A 2008 review detailed the devastating effect gestational vitamin D deficiency has on developing mammalian brains (7).,1
"Unfortunately, the tiny 10 μg (400 IU) dose in prenatal vitamins is virtually irrelevant in preventing the current epidemic of gestational vitamin D deficiency (8).",1
"For this reason, in 2007, the Canadian Paediatric Society cautioned pregnant women they may require not 400 IU/day but 2000 IU/day, or more, to prevent gestational vitamin D deficiency (9).",1
"If adequate amounts of vitamin D prevent autism, one would expect children with rickets to have an increased risk of autism.",1
"To my knowledge, the neuropsychiatric symptoms of rickets have not been studied in the modern era.",1
"However, at least two old papers have addressed it (10,11), both published before Kanner described autism in 1943.",1
"Both papers describe ‘weak mindedness,’‘feeble minds,’‘mental dullness,’ unresponsiveness and developmental delays.",1
"Even more intriguing, both papers report that the mental condition in rickets improved with vitamin D.\nAnother of the mysteries of autism is the apparent increased incidence of autism in the children of richer college-educated parents, especially women, a finding announced a few months ago (12).",1
"Actually, this is not a new finding.",1
"As I discussed in my original paper, this has been known since the early 1980s but was dismissed as being because of ascertainment bias.",1
"This very recent report correlates well with a 2007 CDC report (13), which found a similar increased risk for the wealthy and well-educated, findings the authors tried but could not dismiss as being because of ascertainment bias.",1
"If the vitamin D theory is true, autism should be more common in richer well-educated mothers, who are more likely than other mothers to practice sun avoidance and use sunblock (1,2).",1
"In his invited commentary, Dr. Eyles asked, ‘Does skin colour modify the risk’ of autism, noting melanin in the skin is an effective sunblock.",1
Such studies are difficult as they raise sensitive social issues.,1
"Nevertheless, three of four recent U.S. studies found a higher incidence of autism in black children, sometimes appreciably higher (1,2).",1
"report, the Somali immigrants in Sweden call autism the ‘Swedish disease’ and Somali immigrants in Minnesota call it the ‘American disease,’ but in equatorial Somalia, autism has no name.",1
Toxins delivered by water or air pollution appear to damage the genome of the vitamin D deficient (14).,1
"If exposure to such toxins were the main contributors to autism incidence, then we should have seen an autism incidence pattern in the US that mirrored air and water pollution with a dramatic increase in the 1950s, a peak in the 1960s and then a progressive decline by the early 1980s, coincident with enactment and enforcement of the US clean air and clean water acts of the 1960s.",1
"Another possibility is that air pollution from Eastern Europe, India and China, which has been increasing in the last 20 years, has engendered the current crop of autism.",1
"However, why would foreign air pollution of today do what American air pollution of the 1950s and 60s could not?",1
Another paper published after my original paper found that autistic boys have unexplained reductions in metacarpal bone thickness (15).,1
"At some time in their life, these children laid down less cortical bone than normal children, a finding consistent with undetected and untreated childhood or even intrauterine vitamin D deficiency.",1
Yet another recent paper reported that the prevalence of autism in three U.S. states was higher in areas of higher precipitation and clouds (16).,1
"The 2005 autism prevalence rate among school-aged children, after controlling for differences in population size, demographic characteristics, per capita income and state, was higher in cloudy areas.",1
"The association of autism prevalence and the mean annual precipitation received by a county between 1987 and 2001 was positive and significant (p = 0.0034; 95% confidence interval, 0.0018–0.0050).",1
"Surprisingly, high maternal seafood consumption, of the type known to be contaminated with mercury, has been associated with fewer – not more – autistic markers in the offspring (17).",1
"Lower maternal seafood intake during pregnancy was associated with low verbal intelligence quotient, suboptimum outcomes for prosocial behaviour, fine motor, communication and social development scores.",1
"While the omega-3 and mercury content of fish is well known, less well known is the fact that fish is one of the few foods with significant amounts of vitamin D, which, as referenced earlier, protects the genome from damage by toxins.",1
"While the urban/rural gradient in rickets is well known and was one of the keys to discovering that sunlight prevented rickets, less well known is a meta-analysis showing a twofold urban/rural gradient for autism (18).",1
"Similar to rickets, city life affords less vitamin D, because of tall buildings, indoor occupations and increased urban air pollution, all of which block ultraviolet B light from penetrating the atmosphere.",1
"Finally, a 2008 paper reported that autism was more common among mothers who took antiepileptic drugs (19).",1
"A comment to the authors (20) detailed the evidence that antiepileptic drugs are one of the few classes of drugs that consistently and significantly interfere with vitamin D metabolism, lowering 25(OH)D levels.",1
"I agree with Dr Eyles’ comment that the vitamin D theory is ‘highly parsimonious.’ Indeed, it was love of parsimony that led me to first hypothesize that vitamin D is intimately involved in the pathology and epidemiology of both autism and influenza (21).",1
Some have speculated that the excess of winter births in autism is explained by wintertime maternal viral infections.,1
"Obviously, another, and more parsimonious explanation, is that vitamin D is involved in all three.",1
The vitamin D theory of autism does not diminish genetic contributions to autism occurrence.,1
"Indeed, without the genetic tendency for autism, I suspect that severe maternal or early childhood vitamin D deficiency may cause bone abnormalities, as referenced above, with no evidence autism.",1
"All that the current epidemic of maternal and early childhood vitamin D deficiency does, with its resultant neural deficiency in the pluripotent neurosteroid calcitriol, is to allow the genetic tendency for autism to express itself.",1
"If this theory is true, the path towards effective prevention – and perhaps a treatment effect if adequate physiological doses of vitamin D are given – is so simple, so safe, so inexpensive, so readily available and so easy, that it defies imagination.",1
"Seventeen vitamin D experts recently stated, ‘In our opinion, children with chronic illnesses such as autism, diabetes and/or frequent infections should be supplemented with higher doses of sunshine or vitamin D3, doses adequate to maintain their 25(OH)D levels in the mid-normal of the reference range [65 ng/mL (162 nmol/L)] – and should be so supplemented year round.’ (22)\nFinally, if true, a darker side of the theory emerges.",1
"To some real but unknown extent, autism is an iatrogenic disease, caused by governments, organizations, committees, newspapers and physicians who promulgated the current warnings about sun-exposure for pregnant women and young children without any understanding of the tragedy they engendered.",1
"A Comparative Study of 25 (OH) Vitamin D Serum Levels in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis and Control Group in Isfahan, Iran\n\nAbstract\n\nObjectives:\nThere is no study about correlation between vitamin D serum level and multiple sclerosis (MS) in Iran.",1
"So in this survey, we investigated the serum level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in MS patients and compared it with controls in central region of Iran, an area with medium to high risk for MS disease, in spite of high sun exposure.",1
"Also, our study showed significant discrepancy between the two groups according to the rate of deficiency, insufficiency and normal range of vitamin D categories (P=0.021).",1
"Conclusions:\nWe found the same results as those studies carried out in Europe and North America; i.e., lower serum vitamin D level in MS patients than that in normal population, in spite of sufficient sun exposure in Isfahan region.",1
"INTRODUCTION\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic probably with autoimmune basis and uncertain etiology characterized by demyelinative and inflammatory physiopathology causing axonal damages.12This disease affects females more than males with ordinary 10 years relapsing-remitting course and secondary progressive phase.2On histological basis, T helper cells type 1 (Th1) is the most responsible cause for pathologies seen in MS.1–3There are multiple risk factors for MS in a complex relationship with each other from genetic ones to environmental factors but exact mechanism leading to MS has remained unclear yet.45From guessed environmental risk factors for MS, past infection with EBV, smoking and low serum level of vitamin D are more favorable.67The most important vitamin in calcium and phosphor homeostasis is vitamin D. This vitamin has proposed potential power for modulating immune system.48This is achieved via enhancing the phagocytic function of monocytes9and decreasing the secretion of IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α and PGE2 by monocytes.10Also, immature or semi mature APC’s cannot mature in presence of 1,25 (OH)2D.8Many studies showed a role of paracrine function and nerve growth factor synthesis of vitamin D in CNS and also, showed that deficiency of this vitamin in pregnancy period can cause neural system disorder in animal cases.811–14Then, vitamin D has a near relation with MS and the results of different studies can be summarized as follows: First, the effect of latitude via exposure to sun light and serum level of vitamin D on MS prevalence, that increases with distance from equator, with only one exception in Norway.23815Second, Vander et al.",1
"showed that sun exposure in childhood period prevents from MS.16Third, it seems low risk of MS in white population is associated with high serum level of vitamin D or high oral intake via supplements or oily fish in some studies.217–19Fourth, it have been shown that vitamin D can be a protective agent against experimental autoimmune encephalitis in mice (like MS in humans).48Finally, some scientists administered 100-1700 IU/day vitamin D supplements in MS patients and observed the reduction of relapses.20–22The candidate for estimating serum level of vitamin D is 25-hydroxy vitamin D, because of its prolonged half-life.823–25It is used to assess an individual’s overall vitamin D nutritional status, because its formation, unlike that of 1, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D, is not tightly regulated and it has a relatively long half-life (20-60 days).",1
"There are differences in optimal level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D but nowadays internationally accepted normal range is between 75 nmol/L and 200 nmol/L, and we consider serum level below 75 nmol/L and below 2 nmol/L as insufficiency and deficiency, respectively.42325Even it seems to achieve the prevention of autoimmune diseases, the serum level of vitamin D must be higher than the level required to reduce osteoporosis (higher than 75 nmol/L).4In attention to high prevalence of MS in Iran and especially in Isfahan which is about 43.5/100,0002627and given that Iran is located in an latitude of 32° 50’ and longitude of 51° 43’ with enough sun exposure and because nobody investigated the relationship between vitamin D, as an environmental agent, and MS disease in Iran before, we decided to compare the serum level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in MS patients and healthy control group in Isfahan region.",1
"The mean level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in case and control groups were 48 and 62 nmol/L, respec-tively, and it showed a significant difference between them (P=0.036).There was not any significant relationship between age and serum level of vitamin D in both groups (P=0.83).",1
This study showed a significant relationship between serum levels of vitamin D between the two groups (P=0.021).,1
"DISCUSSION\nWe found the same results as studies in Europe and North America, which implicates lower serum vitamin D level in MS patients than in normal population, in spite of sufficient sun exposure in Isfahan region.23815The hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for MS was first proposed over 30 years ago4and gained credibility after the discovery of the immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D.5Moreover, in the past few years, the epidemiological evidence of an increased MS risk among individuals with low vitamin D concentrations has achieved substantial strength.",1
"Relative to sun exposure, diet is a poor source of colecalciferol, providing only 40-400 IU per food serving,12whereas whole-body UVB exposure for 20 min for a light-skinned person during the summer months will produce at least 10,000 IU.713However, increased skin pigmentation, age, use of sunscreen, built environment, and environmental factors that reduce the strength of UVB reaching the earth’s surface (e.g., winter season, high latitude, pollution, cloud cover, and ozone levels) all contribute to reduce skin colecalciferol production to the point at which diet might become the primary source.7–14Because melanin pigment in human skin absorbs UVB,28black people have lower 25 hydroxyvitamin D concentrations than white people, and are often vitamin D deficient.21However, the risk of MS in black people is lower than in white people (because of genetic differences).28Analyses of the relation between vitamin D status and MS risk are therefore better done separately within each race/ethnic group.",1
The importance of age of exposure and seasonality is uncertain.,1
"Studies in migrants implicate postnatal environmental exposures, but do not exclude prenatal effects.1529Blood concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D fluctuate with season, but the etiological relevance of these fluctuations to MS risk is unknown.",1
"The reasons why vitamin D deficiency is thought to be a risk factor for MS are as follows: First, MS frequency increases with increasing latitude, which is strongly inversely correlated with duration and intensity of UVB from sunlight and vitamin D concentrations.2830–35Second, prevalence of MS is lower than expected at high latitudes in populations with high consumption of vitamin-D-rich fatty fish43536.",1
"Third, MS risk seems to decrease with migration from high to low latitudes.15If vitamin D had any effect on MS risk, we would expect MS incidence to decrease with increasing 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations.",1
"The only study satisfying this condition used a nested case-control design to sample an underlying prospective cohort comprising over 7 million individuals who served in the US military and had at least two serum samples stored in the US Department of Defense Serum Repository.18The study concluded that serum concentration of 25 hydroxyvitamin D in healthy young white adults is an important predictor of their risk of developing MS, independently from their place of birth and latitude of residence during childhood.18In a prospective investigation comprising approximately 200,000 women in the USA, vitamin D intake was measured every 4 years by a comprehensive semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire.37The incidence of MS during the 30-year follow-up decreased with increasing vitamin D intake (P=0.03 for trend) and was 33% lower among women in the highest quintile of vitamin D intake versus those in the lowest quintile.17Furthermore, MS incidence was 41% lower among women taking 400 IU per day or more from supplements compared with non-users.17Attempts to relate vitamin D intake to MS risk have also been made in casecontrol studies.",1
"In Norway, a study comprising 119 MS cases and 251 controls living above the Arctic Circle, where fatty fish is a major contributor to vitamin D intake, reported a lower risk of MS for individuals who ate fish three or more times per week at 16–20 years of age compared with those with a lower consumption (odds ratio=0.57 [95%CI 0.33-0.93]; P=0.024).19Supplementation with codliver oil was also associated with lower risk of MS, but only among individuals with low summer outdoor activity.",1
"In relation to sun exposure and related measures, one of these studies, which comprised 136 individuals with MS and 272 age and sex-matched controls in Tasmania,16collected information on sun exposure at different ages.",1
The odds ratios of MS among individuals who reported spending at least 2 hours per day in the sun during holidays and at weekends at ages 6-10 years were 0.47 (95%CI 0.26-0.84) for winter and 0.50 (0.24-1.02) for exposure; inverse but weaker associations were observed with sun exposure at older ages.,1
"Non-melanoma skin cancer and, less strongly, melanoma are more common in individuals with high levels of sun exposure.",1
"Thus, if vitamin D was protective, these cancers would be expected to be rare among individuals with MS.",1
"In fact, a lower than expected occurrence of skin cancer was reported among individuals with MS in a study in the UK.38Month of birth has also been suggested as a factor that affects MS risk.",1
"In a pooled analysis of data from Canada, UK, Denmark, and Sweden including more than 40,000 individuals with MS, significantly fewer (8.5%) people with MS were born in November and significantly more (9.1%) were born in May.39This finding suggests that prenatal exposures or exposures in the first months of life could be important in MS etiology, but the link to vitamin D is unclear.",1
"Genes also can affect vitamin D metabolism, skin color, and behavior, all of which can influence circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations.",1
"Furthermore, genetic variations in vitamin-D-related and other genes might influence the effects of vitamin D on the immune system.",1
"Therefore, genetic variations in vitamin-D-related genes might also affect MS risk, either directly or by modifying the effects of vitamin D.40\nOur implications for future research and MS prevention and according to the basis of the results of the only longitudinal study of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and MS onset,18and assum-ing that these results are unbiased and vitamin D is truly protective against MS, over 70% of MS cases in the USA and Europe could be prevented by increasing the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration of adolescents and young adults to above 100 nmol/L.4142These concentrations are commonly found only in individuals with outdoor lifestyles in sunny regions, but could be reached in most people by taking 1000-4000 IU colecalciferol daily.8254344Although these doses are largely considered safe and potentially beneficial for other outcomes,819confirmation of safety and efficacy in a large randomized trial is needed before making general recommendations.",1
"One option would be a national or multinational study based on randomization of school districts or other suitable units in regions of low sunlight intensity, perhaps including multiple outcomes that might be affected by vitamin D, such as diabetes, obesity, respiratory infections, and asthma.4546Alternatively, high-risk first-degree relatives of individu-als with MS could be targeted in a smaller trial,47although randomization and compliance could be more challenging.",1
"In either design, contamination of the control group would be a potential concern.",1
"CONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, this study showed that serum vitamin D deficiency might be a potential environmental predisposing factor for developing multiple sclerosis in our region, and need to follow factors that cause this problem including dietary, genetic, and other ones.",1
"Whereas future observational epidemiological studies and genetic and molecular investigations will be useful to strengthen and refine the hypothesis, it might be necessary to do a large randomized trial to establish the safety and efficacy needed to promote large-scale vitamin D supplementation.",1
"A test of the hypothesis that vitamin D could reduce MS risk will require the administration of relatively high doses of vitamin D to hundreds of thousands of young adults for several years, and careful monitoring for unforeseen adverse effects is mandatory.",1
We suggest that an international multidisciplinary working group to be set up to oversee the design of future prevention or supplementation studies.,1
"Furthermore, screening of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations is likely to identify a large proportion of patients who are vitamin D deficient or insufficient, and who might benefit from vitamin D supplementation for prevention of osteoporosis and other complications, especially multiple sclerosis.",1
"Weekly Iron-Folic Acid Supplementation with Regular Deworming Is Cost-Effective in Preventing Anaemia in Women of Reproductive Age in Vietnam\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nTo estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of a project administering de-worming and weekly iron-folic acid supplementation to control anaemia in women of reproductive age in Yen Bai province, Vietnam.",1
"Methods and Findings\nCost effectiveness was evaluated using data on programmatic costs based on two surveys in 2006 and 2009 and impact on anaemia and iron status collected in 2006, 2007, and 2008.",1
"Based on estimated productivity gains for adult women, the benefit:cost ratio is 6.7∶1.",1
Conclusion\nThe study shows that weekly iron-folic acid supplementation and regular de-worming is a low-cost and cost-effective intervention and would be appropriate for population-based introduction in settings with a high prevalence of anaemia and iron deficiency and low malaria infection rates.,1
Introduction\nWHO estimates suggest that globally up to 500 million women of reproductive age suffer from anaemia.,1
Women and children are most vulnerable due to greater iron requirements and those in resource constrained countries are particularly at risk[1].,1
"Severe maternal anaemia increases the risk of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity while less severe anaemia and iron deficiency have been linked to sub-optimal fetal growth, premature birth and low birth weight, as well as iron deficiency in infants[2]–[4]which may impair cognitive development[5].",1
"[""On a broader scale the reduced capacity for work and education due to anaemia and iron deficiency can adversely impact a population's social and economic development[6].""]",1
WHO guidelines recommend daily iron supplementation for pregnant women and children 6–24 months where anaemia rates are 40% or more[7].,1
A recent international expert consultation organized by WHO went further and recommended weekly supplementation with iron and folic acid for all non-pregnant women of reproductive age in areas where anaemia prevalence is greater than 20%[8].,1
A systematic review of 25 original studies concluded that this approach of weekly iron and folic acid supplementation was safe and also effective in improving haemoglobin concentration in women of reproductive age[9].,1
"However, there is no data on cost and cost-effectiveness of population-based weekly supplementation programs, and limited data on other nutritional supplementation programs.",1
"In Vietnam, there has been an increasing awareness of nutritional deficiencies and anaemia, particularly in rural populations.",1
"A national survey in 2000 found anaemia rates were 24.3% for non-pregnant women nationally (26.3% in rural areas), and 32.2% in pregnant women (33.8% in rural areas)[10].",1
"Contributing factors included lack of variety in the diet associated with low income, compounded by high rates of infection with soil-transmitted helminths, particularly hookworm.",1
"A study of pregnant women in the rural central highlands in 2001 identified anaemia prevalence in pregnant women, post-partum women and non-pregnant women of 53%, 62% and 54% respectively[11].",1
As a consequence the Vietnam National Nutrition Strategy 2011–2020 has the reduction of iron deficiency anemia in children less than 5 years of age and reproductive-age women as an objective.,1
However the costs of potential strategies for achieving this are currently unknown.,1
"We report here the cost and cost-effectiveness of the de-worming and weekly iron-folic acid intervention, which has now been delivered to women in Yen Bai province since May 2006.",1
"[""The impact of the program on women's iron and helminth infection status in the first 12 months was assessed using structured questionnaires, stool examination and haemoglobin assessment at the field site, and blood sample analysis for ferritin, soluble Transferrin Receptor and C-Reactive Protein (to identify the presence of acute infection).""]",1
"[""With evidence of the program's positive impact on women's iron status the weekly supplement program with twice-yearly de-worming was scaled up to province level (with an estimated target group of 250,000 women of reproductive age) commencing March 2008.""]",1
"[""The effectiveness of the distribution system and women's compliance were assessed by an independent Non-Government Organization at 10 weeks and 18 and 36 months post-implementation.""]",1
"[""Structured questionnaires were administered to assess the availability of supplements at each level of the distribution chain and women's attitude about, and their history of, taking the supplements[13].""]",1
"In addition, participating women were surveyed to assess their estimate of costs involved in accessing the supplements.",1
"Personnel costs were imputed based on information obtained from interviews with district, commune and village health workers about their total salary and the proportion of time they spent on this intervention.",1
"Assuming that anaemia cases prevented is the measure of effectiveness, the cost-effectiveness of the intervention is USD 4.24 per anaemia case prevented (USD133900 / (175581×18)).",1
"These authors estimate that the productivity gains for an individual removed from anaemia are 5% in manual occupations (70% of employment in a country such as Viet Nam), and 17% in heavy manual occupations (which form 12.7% of employment in manual occupations in Viet Nam: the share of agriculture in GDP is 22.1%)[16].",1
"The estimated dollar value per capita of the productivity gains are calculated as USD1.29, i.e.",1
"Hence the benefit: cost ratio is approximately 6.7∶1, just based on improvements in productivity of women of reproductive age in the workforce.",1
This means that for each dollar invested in a weekly iron supplementation and de-worming program the monetary value in terms of productivity was USD6.70.,1
"There may be additional financial benefits associated with reductions in other health care costs such as those associated with reduced maternal and infant mortality, and a reduction in neural tube defects which cannot readily be quantified.",1
In addition there are possible effects on reduced anaemia in children and men associated with de-worming women of reproductive age and a consequent reduction in helminth transmission.10.1371/journal.pone.0023723.t003\n\nCaption (TABLE-WRAP): TABLE 3\nEffectiveness of the Yen Bai iron supplementation and de-worming program.SurveySample sizeHaemoglobin (g/L)Prevalence of anaemiaBaseline34912238%3 month57412627%12 month57213120%30 month30313019%\nData sourced from Casey et al[13].,1
"Discussion\nThe provision of iron-folic acid supplements on a weekly basis for women of reproductive age is aimed at improving iron stores, particularly prior to pregnancy and during the first trimester before women access ante-natal care.",1
Pre-pregnancy weekly supplements that contain folic acid may also decrease the risk of neural tube defects.,1
"A successful supplementation program must include training of health care system workers, provision of accessible educational materials for the target group and the broader community and a reliable distribution system.",1
Therefore these costs need to be incorporated into the overall cost of an intervention program.,1
We have demonstrated the effective uptake of weekly iron-folic acid supplementation by 70% of woman in Yen Bai province with an annual cost of USD 0.76/woman.,1
This compares to estimates by the National Institute of Nutrition that only 20% of pregnant women are covered by the national antenatal program of daily iron supplementation for which there is no costing.[18].,1
"The costing reported here includes distribution of supplements, health staff training, production and distribution of educational materials and regular monitoring.",1
The possible reasons for the higher uptake of the weekly supplements are many.,1
One likely reason for the difference is convenience.,1
Weekly supplements for women of reproductive age in the program reported here are accessed at village level.,1
The 2009 survey identified that it took women an average of 17 minutes to access the distribution point for weekly supplements.,1
Another reason for high compliance with the weekly program was the maintenance of a reliable supply.,1
A previous study has shown that a poor distribution system and irregular availability were the most significant environmental risk factors for taking iron supplementation continuously[19].,1
"Also, weekly supplements may be better tolerated, with less frequent side-effects thereby increasing acceptance and compliance.",1
"[""The extensive training and community education program was another positive factor which increased acceptance of the supplements as a valuable contribution to women's health.""]",1
The main limitation of the impact evaluation was the lack of a control arm where no intervention was given.,1
"However, we considered it unethical to withhold iron-folic acid supplementation and deworming from women of reproductive age over a long period of time given the evidence from short-term studies on the efficacy of weekly iron-folic acid supplementation[8].",1
"A previous study in Viet Nam followed women of reproductive age receiving weekly supplements, some of whom became pregnant at various points during the 12 months of follow-up.",1
Our study did not have a sample group large or accessible enough to allow an assessment of long-term pregnancy outcomes.,1
"With a larger sample, it would be possible to extend our calculations to estimate the cost per death averted with a reduction of the prevalence of severe anemia in pregnant women.",1
"The relative risk of mortality associated with a 10 g/L increase in hemoglobin is estimated as 0.75 for maternal mortality, and 0.72 for perinatal mortality[21].",1
"The annual cost of USD0.76 per woman treated is consistent with a cost estimate of USD10-13 per pregnancy[22],[23], since pregnant women receive more tablets.",1
"A recent trial in northern China identified an annual cost of USD40.00 to improve antenatal, delivery and postnatal care of which 22% (USD8.80) was to supply and distribute daily supplements to pregnant women[24].",1
Data on cost per pregnancy of daily iron supplementation is quite weak.,1
"For those countries in the Southeast Asia region (SearD) with high adult and child mortality rates, they estimate the cost as $10.12 (but as high as $46.04 per pregnancy in the low mortality countries in the Europe region, EurA).",1
"Behrman, Alderman and Hoddinott, 2004[23], cite estimates for Nepal of $13.14 per pregnancy (based on program estimates extrapolated from a research study).",1
The estimated benefit:cost ratio of 6.7∶1 is similar to the median benefit:cost ratio for iron fortification estimated by Horton and Ross[6]for a range of countries.,1
"Supplementation of women is more costly per person, but has a stronger effect on anaemia.",1
"[""However, fortification benefits both men and women while supplementation directly benefits only women and will only have large labour market benefits in countries where women's participation in the labour market is high.""]",1
"However, in Viet Nam fortification of cereals is not easily available for rural areas (rice, the main staple, is more costly to fortify, and less feasible to fortify given the lack of central processing).",1
There have been experiments with fortification of fish sauce however this is not yet on a commercial scale.,1
At present a supplementation program is the most feasible method for addressing iron and folate deficiencies in Viet Nam.,1
"The cost of coverage with weekly iron-folic acid is comparable to program estimates for distribution of other nutritional supplements such as twice-yearly vitamin A, and zinc.",1
"A recent survey[25]of the cost of micronutrient supplementation programs (both published and “grey” literature) identified 43 studies, of which 31 were for vitamin A, and the rest for iron (7), iodine (4) and zinc (1).",1
"Mean cost per beneficiary were calculated as USD1.95 (vitamin A), USD3.64 (iodine), USD0.52 (zinc – only 1 program), but was not calculated for iron.",1
Mean cost per person-year of “useful” coverage was estimated as USD8.53 (vitamin A) and USD0.74 (iodine) but not available for iron or zinc.,1
"Although Vitamin A capsules were less costly than iron per person (USD0.12/person/year compared to USD0.36), delivery costs for vitamin A were higher: USD1.83 compared to USD0.40.",1
"This may reflect lower coverage with volunteer health workers and lower population densities in Africa, where most costing studies of vitamin A were done.",1
The reported cost structures of delivery for these programs were however somewhat similar.,1
"The costs of providing weekly iron-folic acid in a program setting may also be useful for estimating costs of providing micronutrient powders for home fortification for children 6–36 months, and for therapeutic zinc for children under five.",1
Program cost data for these latter two interventions are almost non-existent.,1
"This study therefore fills a major gap in the cost literature, namely estimating the cost of implementing weekly iron supplementation programs.",1
"It has policy significance given the recommendation to expand coverage of supplementation with weekly iron and folic acid supplements to women of reproductive age, as well as for other similar supplementation programs, such as multiple micronutrient powders and zinc for children.",1
"Effects of ethnicity and vitamin D supplementation on vitamin D status and changes in bone mineral content in infants\n\nAbstract\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nTo evaluate the effects on serum 25(OH)D and bone mineralization of supplementation of breast-fed Hispanic and non-Hispanic Caucasian infants with vitamin D in infants in Houston, Texas.",1
"Conclusion\nLow cord 25(OH)D levels are seen in Hispanic infants, but their functional significance is uncertain related to bone health in a southern US setting.",1
Daily vitamin D intake of 400 IU during the first months of life appears adequate to increase serum 25(OH)D and support BMC increases despite low initial 25(OH)D levels in some infants.,1
The recommended dose of 400 IU (10 micrograms) daily for infants was established based on typical amounts in a teaspoon of cod liver oil [1].,1
This recommendation has recently been reaffirmed as being appropriate by both the Institute of Medicine [2] and the American Academy of Pediatrics [3] whereas the Endocrine Society considers the 400 IU to be a minimum appropriate dose [4].,1
"Although the dose of 400 IU daily is used for both breast-fed and formula-fed babies, vitamin D-deficient rickets is extremely rare in formula-fed infants primarily due to the mandatory addition of vitamin D to infant formulas in the United States.",1
Formula-fed infants typically consume 300-500 IU/day from their formula and therefore generally meet the current recommendations without an additional oral supplement of vitamin D drops especially after the first 6 to 8 weeks of life.,1
The relatively greater calcium and phosphorus concentration in US infant formulas compared to human milk may also be protective against rickets in some infants.,1
"Remarkably, few data have looked at modern techniques of assessing bone mineral status and compared it to vitamin D levels and supplementation in this population [5].",1
Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is accepted as the best marker of vitamin D status although it may serve primarily as a marker of exposure rather than clinical outcomes [2].There are few data that correlate serum 25(OH)D levels with functional outcomes in newborns and small infants.,1
"Neonatal serum 25(OH)D levels reflect a range of in utero factors, most significant of these being the maternal vitamin D status [6].",1
"Although calcium and phosphorus are transported transplacentally without vitamin D, the effects of low vitamin D in utero or shortly after birth are uncertain [7].",1
"This study was conducted to evaluate early life bone mineral content (BMC) and the effects of three months of vitamin D supplementation in breast-fed Hispanic and non-Hispanic Caucasian (henceforth, ""Caucasian"") infants on vitamin D levels.",1
We hypothesized that 25(OH)D would be lower in Hispanic than Caucasian newborns but that these differences would not be substantial enough to be related closely to BMC and bone mineral density (BMD) or their changes during the first three months of life.,1
"However, the relationship between vitamin D status and bone-related outcomes in supplemented infants provides information about the effects of these cord levels and vitamin D supplementation in early infancy.",1
"Furthermore, few data have evaluated Hispanic infants who may be at high-risk for low vitamin D status due to poor maternal vitamin D intake [4].",1
"Other lifestyle and dress habits were not evaluated, and all participants were observed by the study staff for typical Western-style US clothing (sleeveless or short-sleeved shirts in the summer, jackets or coats in the winter).",1
Differences markedly less than are less likely to be biologically relevant and this study was not designed to identify small differences.,1
Statistical analysis was not applied to the relative change in serum 25(OH)D values with low baseline versus high baseline data as there is currently no accepted optimal approach for such an evaluation as reviewed recently by Tu and Gilthorpe [8].,1
We evaluated the relationship between cord blood 25(OH)D and BMC and BMD at one week of age.,1
"BMC was highly correlated to body weight (r = 0.86, p < 0.001) as was BMD (r = 0.56, p < 0.001).",1
"BMC was significantly related to length at one week (r = 0.61, p < 0.001) however, in multivariate analysis including weight and length, only weight was significant, p < 0.001 and length was not significant, p = 0.87.",1
"Length was similar between Hispanic and Caucasians, 50.3 ± 2.1 cm versus 50.5 ± 2.0 cm respectively, p = 0.72.",1
"Prenatal vitamin supplement composition varied by brand; however, most brands included 200 IU vitamin D per pill.",1
There was no relationship between compliance and outcome so this was not further considered in the analysis.,1
Of note is that the BMC and BMD were greater in Hispanic infants at three months but not at one week of age.,1
"When body weight at three months was included as a covariate in this analysis, changes in BMC remained significant, p = 0.03, but changes in BMD were not (p = 0.06).",1
"We found that cord 25(OH)D (dependent variable) was not significantly related to BMC and BMD as shown before, and was not closely related to BMC at three months (p = 0.10).",1
"Discussion\nWe found 25(OH)D levels < 20 ng/mL to be common in the cord blood of infants in a southern climate in the United States representing about 60% of the infants in our study, with about 20% of the infants having values ≤ 10 ng/mL.",1
"However, we did not identify any specific physiological consequences of these cord 25(OH)D levels for bone mineralization at birth as evidenced by initial DXA measurements.",1
Supplementation with 400 IU/day of vitamin D to these infants led to a relatively greater increase in those who were born with the lowest vitamin D status and there was no suggestion of any bone mineral outcome deficits at one week or three months of age in infants with low cord 25(OH)D levels.,1
"We note that our study was of limited size however, and that larger studies are needed in diverse global populations.",1
Our study did not have the ability to identify the effects of small amounts of formula or other nutritional differences between groups.,1
The close relationships between weight and length and initial BMC imply that calcium transfer across the placenta is closely related to overall nutrient transfer and not to vitamin D status (7).,1
"Of note is that few subjects had a cord 25(OH)D < 6 ng/mL, a value found in studies in pregnant women and newborns in the Middle East [9,10].",1
"Neonatal rickets and hypocalcemia have been reported in some, but not all infants with cord or maternal 25(OH)D values < 6-10 ng/mL from the Middle East.",1
"These extremely low values are not commonly reported in the United States, although we speculate that an increasing number of cases may be reported in the future due to increased awareness of vitamin D deficiency.",1
There are very few data on 25(OH)D in cord blood in the Hispanic population and no data looking specifically at the relative increase over time based on cord 25(OH)D [11].,1
We did not have PTH values on the cord blood but PTH values at three months of age were not correlated significantly with 25(OH)D values at birth or three months or with bone mineral outcomes.,1
Differences in 25(OH)D between Hispanic and Caucasian infants may be related to lifestyle including sunshine exposure.,1
These were not evaluated in this study but there are no clear cultural reasons to expect a substantial difference in Houston.,1
"Of note is that in that study, about 10% of infants with these very low 25(OH)D levels had evidence of hypocalcemia although none had physical symptoms and it is not clear if there was a true cause and effect in this group.",1
"Although there was a trend in that study towards a relative increase in 25(OH)D in infants with lower baseline values who received supplementation, this was not clearly demonstrated.",1
"In the United States, median values for 25(OH)D in a northern setting in the first days of life were 17 ng/mL with 58% of infants < 20 ng/mL, results very similar to those seen in our study [13].",1
We found similar ionized calcium levels in Hispanic and Caucasians at birth.,1
"There is some suggestion that late hypocalcemic tetany is more common in Hispanic infants, although this is not well demonstrated due to the limited published data [14].",1
"Regardless, serum calcium in the cord blood and in the first days of life is likely controlled by a variety of factors, of which vitamin D is only one factor.",1
Limited previous research is generally consistent with our findings.,1
Park et al [15] studied Korean infants at 2 to 5 months of age and found no relationship between 25(OH)D level and BMC assessed by DXA even though many of the infants had very low 25(OH)D levels.,1
They speculated that this is due primarily to passive absorption of calcium at this age.,1
It has been suggested but is not proven that early life calcium absorption is primarily non-vitamin D dependent [2].,1
"However, it is likely that by three months of age, vitamin D has a key role in calcium absorption, especially in breast-fed infants with a relatively low calcium intake compared to formula-fed infants.",1
Whether the greater bioavailability of calcium from human milk compared to formula affects the needed level of 25(OH)D by infants is unknown.,1
Greer et al [16] found an increase in 25(OH)D from 24 to 39 ng/mL at three months of age with the provision of 400 IU/day of vitamin D to breast-fed infants.,1
"These results are similar to ours, with slightly higher 25(OH)D values found in the Greer study.",1
Direct comparisons however of 25(OH)D values between studies conducted in the past and recent studies should be done with caution due to well-documented variations in assay techniques.,1
"Therefore, in considering early vitamin D supplementation, the question becomes whether there is physiological benefit to rapid replenishment with vitamin D (e.g.",1
high doses of vitamin D in early life) with or without monitoring of 25(OH)D levels or whether the 400 IU/day dose is adequate.,1
"Our data, from this small dataset, can only be used to partially answer this question specifically related to bone health.",1
"However, it appears that, at least in a southern US setting, 400 IU/day is adequate for infants regardless of vitamin D status at birth.",1
"We cannot rule out the possibility that a small number of infants will be hypocalcemic in the first weeks of life with this approach, but, this appears to be uncommon and may be more related to PTH function than vitamin D. Further research is needed relative to the etiology of symptomatic hypocalcemia in the first weeks of life.",1
Studies in adults have found a greater increase in 25(OH)D levels in subjects who started at a lower level before supplementation [17].,1
Similar data are not readily available in pediatric populations.,1
Caution should be used in interpreting any results for changes in 25(OH)D based on baseline levels.,1
It has been suggested that these results may reflect a regression to the mean phenomenon or may be related in part to measurement variability (8).,1
"However, the findings in our study appear meaningful in that the provision of vitamin D at a dose of 400 IU/day led to mean values that were above 30 ng/mL regardless of starting value or ethnicity.",1
The 30 ng/mL target is well above that likely to be needed for adequate vitamin D status in the newborn based upon the recent recommendations of the Institute of Medicine [2].,1
The effects of maternal vitamin D deficiency are complex and may extend beyond bone health effects in infants.,1
Provision of all pregnant and lactating women with the Recommended Daily Allowance of 600 IU/day is an important public health strategy.,1
"Nonetheless, such supplements are not universally consumed by the population.",1
"The Hispanic community may be at higher risk due to darker skin pigmentation, greater obesity, lower dairy intake and less supplement use.",1
It has been suggested that all Hispanics and all pregnant and lactating women have their 25(OH)D levels monitored [4].,1
Of note is that 25(OH)D levels in a southern United States climate are low despite sunshine exposure year round at the latitude in Houston.,1
"Furthermore, there is a seasonal dependence of 25(OH)D levels although we did not have enough subjects to identify the degree to which this seasonal dependence was affected by ethnicity.",1
We had previously shown a seasonal dependence of 25(OH)D levels in prepubertal girls in Houston [18] with no differences in calcium absorption or kinetics between Hispanic and Caucasian prepubertal girls.,1
"Thus, it is clear that a southern US location is not protective against seasonal deficiency of vitamin D or low cord 25(OH)D levels.",1
"Conclusion\nWe found that low 25(OH)D levels are common in newborns in a southern US climate, especially among Hispanic infants.",1
Our findings support current guidelines to begin vitamin D supplementation of 400 IU/day to all breast-fed infants in the first week of life and to further encourage the provision of adequate vitamin D to pregnant women.,1
Larger studies are needed in diverse populations at various latitudes to further characterize the relationship between vitamin D supplementation and bone mineral content.,1
Maternal Vitamin D Deficiency Delays Glomerular Maturity in F1 and F2 Offspring\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nThere is a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in women of reproductive age.,1
"However, at all ages, both F1 and F2 VitD- mice had shorter glomerular diameters, and diet played a significant role in the total variation.",1
"Immature glomeruli begin to disappear at 10 days, but at this age, F1-VitD- mice had more immature and mature glomeruli than F1-SC mice.",1
"At 6 months of age, F1-VitD- mice exhibited more glomeruli, while F2-VitD- mice exhibited the same number of glomeruli as F2-SC mice, but fewer glomeruli compared to the F1-VitD group.",1
Both diet and generation account for the total variation in the number of glomeruli.,1
Decreases in urine output and podocin expression and increases in urea and creatinine in the urine were observed in F1 offspring.,1
Conclusion\nThese findings demonstrate that maternal vitamin D deficiency accompanies changes in the renal expression of important factors that may retard the maturation of glomeruli by extending the period of nephrogenesis.,1
This insufficiency is likely related to diet[3]and is gaining recognition as a public health problem.,1
"[""The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency is high even in sunny climates, such as Brazil's, principally in adolescents[4].""]",1
"Vitamin D is critical for the development of the nervous system[5],[6]and immunological functions[7]during fetal development.",1
Vitamin D during the pregnancy is important to both maternal skeletal preservation and fetal skeletal formation.,1
"However, new evidence suggests that vitamin D could be vital to normal fetal development and that vitamin D restriction in this period may affect chronic disease susceptibility post-natal life[8].",1
"Furthermore, recent studies have shown that this restriction can generate “genomic imprinting” in the fetus, which is related to the genesis of chronic diseases in adulthood[9].",1
"Moreover, vitamin D is associated with premature births, obesity and renal dysfunction in adulthood, making it more than an essential fat-soluble vitamin responsible for calcium metabolism[9],[10].",1
"Normal development of the kidney is a highly complex process that requires precise cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis[11].",1
"[""Among the essential regulators of kidney development are components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), podocin (a critical component of the glomerular slit diaphragm) and the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene WT1[12].""]",1
"Vitamin D restriction during pregnancy and throughout lactation in rats is associated with an increased number of glomeruli and decreased renal corpuscle size among offspring, although the causes and consequences of this abnormal kidney phenotype remain unknown[13].",1
"Therefore, the adverse effects of vitamin D restriction during kidney development need further exploration.",1
This study investigates the effects of maternal vitamin D deficiency on glomerular development in early postnatal life and its effects on renal structure at maturity.,1
This study focuses on the F1 and F2 generations after F0 maternal vitamin D restriction.,1
"Diet significantly affected KM ( P \u200a=\u200a0.006), but there was no interaction between diet and generation ( P>0.05; two-way ANOVA).",1
"Both diet ( P<0.0001) and generation ( P \u200a=\u200a0.003) affected the GD, but there was no interaction between diet and generation ( P>0.05; two-way ANOVA).",1
"At 10 days of age, generation contributed significantly to KM ( P<0.0001), but there was no interaction between diet and generation ( P>0.05; two-way ANOVA).",1
"Diet affected the GD in 10-day-old offspring ( P<0.0001), but there was no interaction between diet and generation ( P>0.05; two-way ANOVA).",1
"Immature glomeruli normally begin to disappear at this age, but the F1-VitD- mice had 150% more immature glomeruli and 25% more mature glomeruli than the F1-SC mice ( P<0.0001).",1
"Diet significantly affected the GD at 6 months of age ( P \u200a=\u200a0.0008), but there was no interaction between diet and generation ( P>0.05; two-way ANOVA).",1
"Both diet ( P \u200a=\u200a0.001) and generation ( P \u200a=\u200a0.04) affected the number of glomeruli at 6 months of age, but there was no interaction between diet and generation ( P>0.05; two-way ANOVA).",1
"However, the 24 h urine output, adjusted for BM, was significant lower (−60%; P \u200a=\u200a0.004) in the F1-VitD- mice than the F1-SC mice, even without differences in water intake between these groups.",1
"However, at 6 month of age, in both the F1 and F2 generations, the VitD- mice had significantly higher values of renin expression than the SC mice ( P \u200a=\u200a0.001).",1
"AT1r expression was significantly higher at 6 months of age than at weaning only in F1-VitD- offspring ( P \u200a=\u200a0.0007,Fig.",1
"Therefore, podocin expression was significantly different between the F1 and F2 generations among VitD- offspring at weaning ( P \u200a=\u200a0.02) and at 6 months of age ( P \u200a=\u200a0.004).",1
"Discussion\nMicronutrient deficiency during development, such as maternal vitamin D deficiency, is a subject of increasing importance because of the nutritional deficiencies caused by excessive consumption of junk food during pregnancy.",1
"However, vitamin D insufficiency is still under-recognized and under-treated, despite its prevalence.",1
A recent study of pregnant women in Europe reported that only 12% had an optimal level of vitamin D[20].,1
"In the present study, maternal vitamin D deficiency in mice led to significant changes in kidney development in the offspring, such as retardation of glomerular maturation and an increase in the number of glomeruli.",1
"Furthermore, not only the F1 generation but also the F2 generation was affected by the gestational vitamin D deficiency of the F0 generation mice.",1
"Vitamin D is normally stored in the liver and adipose tissue, and after six weeks on a restricted diet, the vitamin D levels were extremely reduced without alteration of calcium or phosphate levels in the rodents[21].",1
"Previous studies in rodents have shown that the restriction of vitamin D for a period of six weeks prior to mating assures vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy[13],[22].",1
"Vitamin D deficiency during the third trimester of pregnancy in humans has been associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity in offspring[23], which could be linked to the potential role of vitamin D in the regulation of adiposity[24],[25].",1
"Maternal nutrient restriction causes adiposity in offspring[26], and recent data suggest that maternal vitamin D deficiency affects adiposity, although the mechanisms are not yet fully understood[23].",1
"In the present study, adiposity was not the focus.",1
"However, there was a significant increase in BM in both generations of VitD- offspring at six months of age, but the BM was higher only in the F2-VitD- group at weaning.",1
"However, at three months of age, the VitD- groups in both the F1 and F2 generations showed a tendency toward increased BM, although the difference was not statistically significant.",1
The small sample size of the groups could explain these results.,1
"In rats, it has been observed that maternal vitamin D deficiency leads to a significant increase in the number of glomeruli, which is a unique and important effect of vitamin D restriction during fetal development[13].",1
"To understand this result, it should be emphasized that nephrogenesis in rodents, unlike in humans, continues after delivery for the first 10 days of postnatal life.",1
This period is roughly comparable to the third gestational trimester of humans[27].,1
"Experimental models have demonstrated that blocking the RAS during development causes changes in the glomerular vasculature that affects the normal maturity of the kidney, although the RAS cascade during kidney development is not fully understood[28],[29].",1
Research suggests that vitamin D is important for differentiation and maturation during cell proliferation[9]and that it down-regulates renin gene expression in the kidneys[13].,1
"However, in the present study, renin expression was significantly higher at six months of age in both the F1 and F2 generations, and AT1r expression was higher in F1-VitD- offspring than in F1-SC offspring.",1
Kidney organogenesis is begun and maintained as a result of a series of regulatory molecules.,1
"WT1 is expressed in the metanephric blastema and probably plays a key role in podocyte differentiation[12],[30].",1
"Although the VitD- offspring in the present study did not show a reduction in WT1 expression, maternal vitamin D deficiency did alter the ratio of immature-to-mature glomeruli at birth by extending the period of glomerular maturation.",1
"Maternal vitamin D deficiency may also have contributed to an increased number of glomeruli, thus producing smaller glomeruli than in animals fed SC.",1
"Indeed, the smaller glomeruli could explain the high BP observed among F1-VitD- offspring and the strong tendency toward high BP observed in the F2 generation.",1
"Previous research has documented a negative correlation between the number of glomeruli and BP levels in humans[31]and in rodents[27],[32].",1
This finding is consistent with the high renin and AT1r expressions observed in the present study.,1
Activation of the RAS may play a significant role in the development of mechanisms that lead to kidney damage[33].,1
Two hypotheses are currently proposed to explain the progression of chronic renal disease.,1
The results of the present study are consistent with the “overload hypothesis”.,1
"This hypothesis suggests that structural and functional adaptations are associated with glomerular hypertension, hyperfiltration, and hypertrophy partially compensated for nephron losses[34].",1
Podocin provides the structural organization of the slit diaphragm and the regulation of filtration function and seems to be involved in the alteration of the glomerular basement membrane[35].,1
"Nephrin is expressed late in the process of podocyte differentiation and is a locus for the formation of the slit diaphragm, foot process maintenance and physical integrity in vivo , but it is dispensable for cell survival and has little impact on gene regulation during glomerular development.",1
"In the present study, vitamin D restriction during nephrogenesis reduced podocin expression in the F1 generation from weaning until six months of age but not in the F2 generation.",1
Such effects should be evaluated because podocin serves in the structural organization of the slit diaphragm and the regulation of its filtration function[35].,1
"Although the mature animals did not show significant proteinuria, maternal vitamin D deficiency altered podocin expression in the F1 generation from weaning until six months of age, but not in the F2 generation.",1
The question of how developmental programming passes to subsequent generations deserves further attention.,1
"Intense maternal protein restriction, for example, leads to chronic diseases in adult life, affecting both the F1 and F2 generations[37],[38], and reaching even the F3 generation[39].",1
Part of the explanation seems to be decreased global methylation in these offspring[40].,1
The present study has certain limitations.,1
"The major aim of the study was to investigate glomerular development and renal structure at birth, 10 days and adulthood in mice born to mothers fed a diet restricted in vitamin D. Although, we examined other variables, such as body mass and 24 h urine, the present study was not designed to investigate renal functional and metabolic consequences but rather was designed to answer the question of whether there were structural, glomerular alterations or transgenerational effects.",1
Further studies are necessary to clarify the impact of maternal vitamin D restriction on the renal function of offspring.,1
"Furthermore, the literature shows some relationship between vitamin D deficiency and adipose tissue development, and other studies should evaluate such effects, and the transgenerational effects.",1
"In conclusion, the present findings provide insight into the relationship between maternal vitamin D deficiency and the occurrence of a greater number of glomeruli in offspring.",1
"Maternal vitamin D deficiency is accompanied by changes in the renal expression of podocin, renin and AT1 receptors, and it delays the maturity of the glomeruli, by extending nephrogenesis.",1
"These findings are more pronounced in F1 progeny, but F2 progeny are also affected.",1
The Efficacy and Safety of a High Dose of Vitamin D in Mothers with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial\n\nAbstract\nBackground: During pregnancy and lactation outstanding changes occur in mother’s vitamin D metabolism.,1
"This study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of 300,000 IU vitamin D given intramuscularly on body status in new cases of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).",1
"The median concentration of serum 25(OH)D3 in the IG was to 62.10 nmol/l after the intervention, showing an increase of around 158%, compared to before intervention (24.25 nmol/l) whereas the CG showed a decrease of around 4.5%.",1
"Conclusions: The single 300,000 IM dose of vitamin D is regarded as an effective and safe to promptly improve vitamin D status in GDM.",1
"These changes occur according to the needs for the mineralization of the fetus bones as well as adequate secretion of vitamin D in mother’s milk.1\nDue to rapid fetal development, particularly bone calcification at the terminal stages of pregnancy, there is a possibility of vitamin D deficiency to occur in mothers.",1
"Since, fetus and baby are both dependent upon mother for blood and milk respectively, mother’s vitamin D supplementation is highly vital.",1
"Studies have indicated that during pregnancy vitamin D deficiency varies from 18% to 84%, which varies with the region under the study and type of clothing.2,3Vitamin D deficiency among breast-fed children in the regions with heavy sunshine such as the Middle East is high.3-5This hypovitaminosis which is due to limited exposure to sun of mothers’ and their babies as well as low vitamin D intake by mothers.",1
These can cause vitamin D deficiency in mothers’ milk as the only source of vitamin D for babies.6\nThere are evidences showing the role of vitamin D in keeping normal glucose homeostasis.7-10Resistance to insulin and destruction of insulin secretion in human and animal models has considerably been related to vitamin D deficiency.,1
"Such a relation has been attributed to special receptors for vitamin D in pancreatic betacells.9Moreover, vitamin D was shown to have positive effects on insulin sensitivity, and its deficiency to have negative effects on the function of betacells.11In agreement with this, cohort studies revealed that vitamin D had a protective effect against diabetes type II.8,11Also, serum concentration of vitamin D during 24-29thweek of pregnancy in women suffering from gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was lower than that in women without the disease.12\nThe study of vitamin D status and improving it in the lactating mothers with previous GDM is of conspicuous value.4,13\nDue to the limited exposure to sunshine and inadequate intake, the level of vitamin D is reduced in the milk of lactating mothers.",1
"Therefore, vitamin D supplementation in high doses has been recommended, and oral doses of 20000 or 40000 IU were associated with positive outcomes.6,14Moreover, higher oral dose of (6400 IU per day) to lactating mothers significantly increased vitamin D status in mothers as well as the vitamin D content and antirachitic activity of their milk.14Therefore, high doses of vitamin D, either orally or through injection, has recently been recommended.15-24\nA single dose of vitamin D, administered parenterally, would be more effective, because it is not associated with the noncompliance associated with an oral dose.",1
"A dose of 600,000 IU vitamin D resulted in hypercalcemia, therefore, it can not be regarded a safe dose.17There is no study to evaluate vitamin D status in mothers with previous GDM, and present oral vitamin D products are not fully effective,16therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the effect of intramuscular injection of 300,000 IU during a three-month period.",1
"There was no difference between the serum concentration of PTH of the IG and CG prior to intervention, however, serum concentration of PTH after the intervention was significantly lower in the IG than that of CG.",1
"Caption (TABLE-WRAP): TABLE 3:\n\nThe number and (percentage) frequency distribution of vitamin D status in the intervention group (IG) and control group (CG) before and after interventionGroupsVitamin D status (nmol/l)IGCGBeforeAfterBeforeAfterSevere deficient (<12.5)0000Moderate deficient (12.5-24.9)15(62.5%)09(42.9%)10(47.6%)Mild deficient (25-34.9)4(16.7%)1(4.2%)7(33.3%)3(14.3%)Optimal (>35)5(20.8%)23(95.8%)4(19%)6(28.6%)\n\nDiscussion\nIf vitamin D deficiency is defined as serum concentration of 25(OH) vitamin D3 lower than 35 nmol/l,12about 80% of the mothers with GDM in the present study were suffering to some degrees from vitamin D deficiency.",1
"This indicates the efficacy of this procedure in dramatic improvement of vitamin D status in the mothers, especially in the region with high vitamin D deficiency.",1
"Considering the range of obtained serum calcium and phosphorus in mothers, no incidence of hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, or hypervitaminosis, this dosage and route of supplementation of vitamin D seems to be safe for mothers and their infants.",1
"In this study, the median concentration of the serum vitamin D in the IG raised from 24.25 to 62.10 nmol/l, which is in line with a recent survey carried out by Restorff et al.26on 33 rheumatoid arthritic patients.",1
"They showed that supplementation with an oral dose of 300,000 IU of vitamin D and 500-1000 mg daily of calcium led to an increase in the concentration of serum vitamin D from 15 to 81.4 nmol/l.",1
"Moreover, similar to that find by Restroff et al.26serum PTH of the IG decreased significantly by 22% in our study.",1
"The mechanism of PTH reduction is that an increased serum vitamin D leads to a decrease in PTH gene translation, and thus PTH secretion.",1
"On the other hand, increased serum calcium causes the intracellular calcium to attach to calcium receptors on the surface of parathyroid cells causing a change in a special form of the receptors.",1
"Such a change results in the inhibition of PTH secretion from parathyroid cells.27\nThe increase of serum calcium in the IG in the present study is similar to that reported in the other studies.15,17-20,22-25,27,28The mechanism of increasing serum calcium by vitamin D is that vitamin D attaches optionally to receptors X of retinoic acid (RXR), and composes a heteromeric complex with a certain sequence on the DNA, known as reacting elements to vitamin D. This leads to the transcription of a special mRNA, which results in the translation of several proteins such as epithelial calcium channels and the proteins attached to calcium.",1
"This results in the increase of calcium absorption from the intestine.27\nPrevious studies,17,27of intramuscular injection of 600,000 unit of vitamin D was associated with significant increases of serum vitamin D at 1.5, 3, and 6 months, but not significant at 9 and 12 months later.",1
"In these studies,17,27as well as ours, serum calcium level considerably increased, but contrary to ours, they reported abnormal calcium level in 7% to 12% of the patients during the study.",1
"In another study,15administration of 600,000 IU of vitamin D was associated with a significant increase in serum vitamin D, a significant decrease in serum PTH, and hypercalcemia occurring in 4% of the subjects during 4 and 12 months of intervention.",1
"In our study, no hypocalcaemia was observed indicating the safety and efficiency of this supplementation method.",1
"A recent study,21has indicated that administrating a high dose of vitamin D every two months was an easy and comfortable treatment.",1
The study was evaluated as more economic and effective in terms of patients’ compliance.,1
"Our study revealed that a single high dose injection of vitamin D is more economic and effective particularly in lactating mothers who refrain from consuming oral daily doses due to postpartum care, unwillingness or depression.",1
"Witham et al.24showed that single doses of 100,000 and 200,000 IU of vitamin D in diabetic type II patients increased serum vitamin D from 41 to 63 and from 48 to79 nmol./l respectively.",1
"However, they showed that the decrease of PTH did not reach statistical significance.",1
"Moreover, another study,18showed that a single dose of 200,000 IU of vitamin D in the healthy youths was associated with a peak in vitamin D concentration after two weeks of treatment, but lower than that of our study at three months after treatment.",1
"Therefore, a single dose of 300,000 IU dose employed in this study is of higher effectiveness compared with an oral dose, especially in people suffering from vitamin D deficiency.",1
"However, our study is limited for not measuring urine calcium and creatinin, since these variables could confirm the presence of hypervitaminosis more exactly and more confidently.",1
"Moreover, serum vitamin D was measured by ELISA kit, which is of lower accuracy compared with HPLC and RIA methods.",1
"Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of postpartum supplementation of vitamin D on antirachitic factor of the mother’s milk, and infant’s health indexes.",1
"Moreover, additional clinical trial studies will have to be conducted to determine the effect of mega doses of vitamin D on other health-related parameters such as the factors related to metabolic syndrome as well as inflammatory markers.",1
"Conclusion\nThe findings of the study indicate that intramuscular administration of a single dose of 300,000 IU of vitamin D is effective and safe to improve vitamin D status, and to ameliorate the factors related to the health of mothers and infants, particularly in the regions with severe vitamin D deficiency.",1
Vitamin D in pregnancy: A metabolic outlook\n\nAbstract\nVitamin D deficiency is a preventable health problem.,1
"Research indicates that adequate vitamin D intake in pregnancy is optimal for maternal, fetal and child health.",1
"Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is the origin for a host of future perils for the child, especially effect on neurodevelopment and immune system.",1
Some of this damage done by maternal Vitamin D deficiency gets evident after many years.,1
"Therefore, prevention of vitamin D deficiency among pregnant women is essential.",1
"The currently recommended supplementation amount of vitamin D is not sufficient to maintain a value of 25 hydroxy vitamin D above 30 ng/ml, during pregnancy.",1
Studies are underway to establish the recommended daily doses of vitamin D in pregnant women.,1
"Clearly, further investigation is required into the effects of vitamin D, of vitamin D supplementation, and of vitamin D analogs for improvement in human health generally and mothers and children specifically.",1
"This review discusses vitamin D metabolism, dietary requirements and recommendations and implications of vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy and lactation.",1
INTRODUCTION\nVitamin D has been a hot topic in the medical world for the past 10 years.,1
Concerns about vitamin D have resurfaced in medical and scientific literature owing to its multiple effects on human health.,1
We are beginning to learn that it plays a much wider role in health and disease prevention.,1
"The classical and non-classical pathways of this hormone affect calcium metabolism, the immune system, cell proliferation and differentiation, infection, and cancer.",1
"[1] The question scientists have been working on for almost a decade is why and how vitamin D is affecting conception, pregnancy and the health of the newborn.",1
"[2] Also the media has been taking increasing interest, and public expectations have been raised regarding the enhanced roles for vitamin D in pregnancy.",1
"It is an unrecognized epidemic common among children, adults and pregnant women throughout the world, across ethnicity and season.",1
"[2] There are increasing studies worldwide reporting poor vitamin D status, including those in tropical countries.",1
The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency has been reported to range from 15% to 80%.,1
[34] It is now recognized that everyone is at risk for vitamin D deficiency.,1
Modern day cosmetology and our urbanization has eclipsed the sunlight and it is impossible is to fulfill daily intake via diet as a large amount of vitamin D needs to be consumed.,1
"Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in India, a finding that is unexpected in a tropical country with abundant sunshine.",1
There are few data from India about the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in pregnancy and in the newborn.,1
[5] The increasing prevalence of disorders linked to vitamin D deficiency is reflected in the several hundred children with rickets treated each year.,1
[6] Low dietary calcium intake and 25(OH) D concentrations were associated with deleterious effects on bone mineral homeostasis.,1
"In the last 3 years, an increasing amount of research suggests that some of the damage done by Vitamin D deficiency is done in-utero, while the fetus is developing.",1
"Much of that damage may be permanent, that is, it cannot be fully reversed by taking Vitamin D after birth.",1
VITAMIND METABOLISM\nVitamin D is a misnomer.,1
"Because of its steroid structure and function, vitamin D plays an important role in priming cells for other hormones to do their action.",1
"[7]\nVitamin D itself is devoid of any biological activity, but enzymatic conversion to 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH) 2D] generates the hormonal form with diverse biological activities.",1
"[8] The active form of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 1,25[OH] 2D3) has well-established effects on bone metabolism and mineral homeostasis.",1
"However, recently it has become clear that 1,25(OH) 2D3 has potent anti-proliferative and immunomodulatory actions that are not immediately linked to its role as a skeletal regulator.",1
"Approximately 25-30 g of calcium are transferred to the fetal skeleton by the end of pregnancy, most of which is transferred during the last trimester.",1
"The requirement for vitamin D in maintaining normal calcium metabolism throughout pregnancy and lactation in mothers, fetuses and newborn infants is still controversial.",1
"It is clear, however, that vitamin D requirements are increased in mothers during pregnancy and lactation.",1
"[10] The synthesis, metabolism and function of vitamin D compounds during pregnancy are complex.",1
"Data suggest that 1,25(OH) 2D aids implantation and maintains normal pregnancy, supports fetal growth through delivery of calcium, controls secretion of multiple placental hormones, and limits production of proinflammatory cytokines.",1
"Notably, the 24,25(OH) 2D synthesized by the placenta accumulates in bone and may be involved in ossification of the fetal skeleton.",1
"Although transplacental transport has not been studied in humans, vitamin D passage from the mother to the fetus would be facilitated by serum concentrations of 1,25(OH) 2D being higher in the maternal compared to the fetal circulations.",1
[12] Vitamin D deficiency can result in lower bone mineral density and an increased risk of bone loss (osteoporosis) or bone fracture because a lack of vitamin D alters mineral metabolism in the body.,1
"[""Sources of vitamin D\nThe most important source of vitamin D is the skin's synthesis of the vitamin from sunlight.""]",1
"[13] Use of sun blocks, increased coverage of clothing and time spent indoors increase the risk of Vitamin D deficiency.",1
"It has been estimated that exposure to sunlight for usually no more than 5-15 min/d between 10 AM and 3 PM, in the spring, summer, and fall at latitudes above and below 35° (and all year near the equator) to exposed parts of the body involving “arms, legs and face “provides the body with its required 1000 IU of cholecalciferol.",1
Sunshine in not adequate in many parts of world.,1
"In the United States staple foods like milk, breakfast cereals and margarines are artificially fortified with vitamin D.[14] At present, the number and variety of vitamin D fortified foods available on the market differs significantly between countries and is attributed to the country-specific policies on food fortification which are not yet unified.",1
"Vitamin D is present in a small number of foods, although, for an average person food will only supply about 10% of the amount needed.",1
"[""Although liver and cod liver oil contain vitamin D, they are not recommended in pregnancy as they also contain too much vitamin A.\nVitamin D is a unique nutrient because its requirement can be met by both endogenous production from sunlight as well as exogenous dietary sources, which complicates determining the body's daily nutritional requirements.""]",1
"Methods are currently available to quantify the contribution of endogenous vitamin D synthesis resulting from sun exposure, but serious limitations remain in accurately estimating dietary vitamin D intake because of the incompleteness of nutrient databases for both vitamin D-fortified food and vitamin D supplements.",1
"[""Thus, increasing vitamin D intake from vitamin D fortified foods, and vitamin D supplements, in combination with sensible sun exposure, maximize a person's vitamin D status to promote good health.""]",1
Women with darker skin Fitzpatrick Class 6 are more prone to Vitamin D deficiency as they need four to ten times sunlight than Fitzpatrick Class 1-4 skinned people for adequate Vitamin D synthesis.,1
"[15] Thus, Daily vitamin requirement varies with ethnicity, and this is relevant in case of Indian population.",1
Obesity is a growing epidemic.,1
"Pre-pregnancy obesity is also associated with significant increases in the odds of maternal and neonatal vitamin D deficiency, independent of other factors such as ethnicity.",1
"[16] This deficiency is because body fat stores much of the vitamin D made in the skin, making it less available to the body.",1
"[""Women who have intestinal malabsorption diseases like celiac disease and Crohn's disease or partial removal or bypass of the stomach or intestines absorb less of both dietary and supplemental vitamin D are at increased risk of deficiency.""]",1
"Overdose\nHypervitaminosis D is a serious, albeit very rare, condition.",1
"There is controversy concerning levels of nutrient intake, and at times the concept that “more is better” emerges.",1
It is said that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations above 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) are “not consistently associated with increased benefit”.,1
"For vitamin D, there are still underlying questions: How much is the daily requirement and How much is too much?",1
"[17] New research suggests that women who take high doses of vitamin D during pregnancy have a greatly reduced risk of complications, including gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and infection.",1
[18] This recommendation may be controversial because very high doses of vitamin D have long been believed to cause birth defects.,1
W\nEpidemiological analyses implicated high dietary vitamin D intake during pregnancy results in birth of syndromic babies.,1
Friedman and colleagues developed a model for this disorder in rabbits by administering near-fatal amounts of ergocalciferol during pregnancy.,1
"[20] Based on these accumulated observations, the uncertain teratogenic potential of high doses of calciferol analogs or of the associated disturbances in mineral homeostasis continues to cause concern.",1
Various human studies are done so far involving pharmacological doses of vitamin D during pregnancy.,1
"reported that as hypoparathyroid patients have completed many pregnancies while receiving ergocalciferol,[21] it is unlikely that material vitamin D, 25(OH) D, or 24,25(OH) 2D per se are teratogens.",1
"Most prenatal vitamins have around 400 IU of vitamin D, and most health groups recommend taking no more than 2,000 IU of the vitamin in supplement form daily.",1
"Eventually, as circulating 25(OH) D increases to toxic concentrations, the classic situation of hypercalciuria, hypercalcemia, and, finally, extraskeletal calcification becomes evident.",1
"[1819] To attain circulating 25(OH) D concentrations that exceed 250 nmol/L (100 ng/mL), a daily vitamin D intake well in excess of 10,000 IU/d (250 μg/d) for several months would be required.",1
"However, hypervitaminosis D has never occurred when physiologic amounts of vitamin D are ingested.",1
"In addition, no case of hypervitaminosis D from sun exposure has ever been reported.",1
"This is supported by the recent finding from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examining the effects of a single annual megadose of vitamin D3 (500,000 IU, equivalent to approximately 1370 IU/d) on fall and fracture outcomes in community-dwelling elderly women with a history of fall or fracture.",1
"Role of vitamin D in pregnant women\nAdequate vitamin D intake is essential for maternal and fetal health during pregnancy, and prevention of adverse outcomes.",1
Recent work emphasizes the importance of non-classical roles of vitamin D in pregnancy and the placenta.,1
"Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is associated with the non-classical actions of this hormone, being linked with preeclampsia, insulin resistance, gestational diabetes mellitus,[22] bacterial vaginosis, and an increased risk for caesarean section delivery.",1
Women who have vitamin D deficiency do not usually feel any different but in some may have muscle weakness and weakened bones.,1
A new study finds that women who develop severe preeclampsia tend to have lower blood levels of vitamin D than healthy pregnant women raising the possibility that the vitamin plays a role in the complication.,1
"Vitamin D supplementation reduces preeclampsia risk, compared to unsupplemented controls.",1
"[23] Preeclampsia is associated with low circulating levels of IGF-I and 1,25(OH) 2D and, in vitro , IGF-1 increases 1,25(OH) 2D production by primary human syncytiotrophoblasts from placentas from normal pregnancies but not from preeclamptic pregnancies.",1
"Studies by other groups have reported abnormal expression of 1α-hydroxylase, a vitamin D—activating enzyme in preeclamptic pregnancies, revealing a potential role for 1,25(OH) 2D3 as a regulator of placentation.",1
Induction of the 1α-hydroxylase in early gestation might provide a mechanism by which environmental or dietary vitamin D can influence fetal-placental development.,1
"Two clinical trials support a potential role of vitamin D in the prevention of preeclampsia, although neither of these treated with vitamin D supplements alone.",1
[24] Vitamin D supplementation in early pregnancy should be explored for preventing preeclampsia and promoting neonatal well-being.,1
Vitamin D is known to influence insulin secretion.,1
"1,25(OH) 2D regulates insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells and thereby affects circulating glucose levels.",1
"[25] As expected, low concentration of 25(OH) D is a risk factor for insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and features of metabolic syndrome in normoglycemic subjects.",1
Vitamin D deficiency during early pregnancy significantly increases the risk for gestational diabetes in later pregnancy.,1
[26]\nVitamin D may influence the course of infectious diseases during pregnancy.,1
Low 25(OH) D levels are correlated with increased bacterial vaginosis in the first trimester.,1
"Bacterial vaginosis is more prevalent in black women, who typically have lower serum 25(OH) D concentrations and have a six-fold higher chance of vitamin D deficiency, compared with white women.",1
"Vitamin D has effects on the immune system, cytokines, and antibacterial peptides that are likely to regulate the bacterial flora.",1
Nutritional vitamin D status has very recently been linked to the human innate immune system and its ability to contain Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,1
"Serum 25(OH) D levels are inversely related to primary cesarean section in nulliparous women, an unexpected and unexplained maternal outcome recently identified.",1
The risk was four-fold higher in women with serum 25(OH) D levels below 37.5 nmol/L (15ng/mL) controlling for multiple confounding factors.,1
"VDR and 1,25(OH) 2D normally increase skeletal muscle function.",1
"Conversely, vitamin D deficiency results in proximal muscle weakness and decreased lower extremity muscle function perhaps contributing to the risk for cesarean section.",1
The Cochrane review concluded that there is not enough evidence to evaluate the requirements and effects of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy.,1
"Data from three trials involving 463 women show a trend for women who receive vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy to more frequently have a baby with a birth weight below 2500 grams than those women receiving no treatment or placebo, although the statistical significance was borderline.",1
"Animal models of vitamin D deficiency have shown just how important adequate nutritional intakes of vitamin D are to skeletal, cardiovascular, and neurologic development in experimental animals.",1
"[27] Weishaar and Simpson[28] showed that lengthy periods of vitamin D deficiency in rats are associated with profound changes in cardiovascular function, including increases in cardiac and vascular muscle contractile function.",1
A recent study provides evidence with reference to the consequences of vitamin D deficiency on the neurodevelopment of the fetus during pregnancy in a rat model.,1
"[28] A study on rodents showed that hypovitaminosis D trabecular bone loss, and concluded that vitamin D is indispensable for normal bone mineralization during the reproductive period in rats.",1
[29]\nVitamin D appears to have a protective effect against multiple sclerosis (MS).,1
"Research has found direct connections between vitamin D and the genes known to be involved in MS, but exact pathology and whether vitamin D supplements during pregnancy or childhood can lessen the likelihood of the child developing MS later in life is not known.",1
"While there is interest in the role of vitamin D in the prevention of multiple sclerosis, following epidemiological studies demonstrating an association between vitamin D supplementation and reduced prevalence of the disease, future research, including randomized controlled trials in pregnant or nonpregnant individuals, is awaited to confirm or refute such benefit.",1
"Because the poor vitamin D stores of the mother may impair vitamin D state in the infant, it is important to know whether rickets can be prevented in breast fed infants by supplementation of the mother.",1
[30] The Canadian Pediatric Society recommended 2000 IU of vitamin D3 for pregnant and lactating mothers with periodic blood tests to check levels of 25(OH) D and calcium.,1
[31] The American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations focus on supplementing the infant and make no specific recommendations about universally supplementing breastfeeding mothers.,1
A sufficient supply of vitamin D to the breast fed infant is achieved only by increasing the maternal supplementation up to 2000 IU/day.,1
As such a dose is far higher than the daily dietary allowance recommended for lactating mothers its safety over prolonged periods is not known and should be examined.,1
Other suggests vitamin D supplementation of 400 IU/day to breast fed infants is the most secure way of preventing rickets in infants.,1
[32]\n\nRole of vitamin D in newborn and infant\nAdequate maternal vitamin D levels are also important for fetal and child health.,1
"Fetal Vitamin D concentrations are mainly dependent on maternal concentration, and maternal deficiency may lead to adverse outcomes in offspring.",1
"Vitamin D-deficiency in mothers have significantly increased risk of infantile rickets due to inadequate maternal–fetal transfer of 25-hydroxyvitamin D.[32] Recent retrospective studies found a significant and previously undetected association of maternal vitamin D deficiency with rickets-associated infant heart failure and with acute lower respiratory tract infection,[33] a serious complication often associated with sepsis without clinical signs of rickets.",1
While vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy has previously been associated with reduced risk of wheezing and type 1 diabetes.,1
[34] A few studies have observed that maternal Vitamin D concentrations are related to offspring birth weight and growth during the postnatal years.,1
Lower maternal vitamin D status was associated with lower bone mineral concentration and impaired glucose homeostasis in newborn infants.,1
"[35] Maternal vitamin D deficiency also has been associated with craniotabes,[35] a softening of skull bones that is one of the earliest signs of vitamin D deficiency, in a case study with neonatal seizures of a hypocalcemic infant and with impaired skeletal development in utero.",1
"[34] Interestingly, vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is also associated with risks of health problems later in childhood, including improper bone development at 9 yrs of age, asthma,[36] dental cavities, schizophrenia, and type I diabetes.",1
[37–39]\nThe concept that maternal nutritional status influences the risk of chronic disorders in the offspring has attracted interest over the past 2 decades.,1
"However, very few studies have been in position to examine this association directly in animals.",1
"Women of Indian origin, especially pregnant women, are known to have a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.",1
In Indian women calcium intakes are low and the demands on calcium economy are high because of repeated cycles of pregnancy and lactation.,1
Although there was no association between maternal Vitamin D status and offspring birth size.,1
"At present, vitamin D supplementation is not a part of antenatal care programs in India.",1
"Testing and treatment for vitamin D deficiency\nWomen of reproductive age are assumed to be able to obtain the recommended intake for almost all vitamins without the use of supplements, and no national organization recommends routine vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy unless a woman is at nutritional risk.",1
One approach is to consider serum testing in patients at high risk for vitamin D deficiency but treating without testing those at lower risk.,1
"The basis for these recommendations was made before it was possible to measure the circulating concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH) D], the indicator of nutritional vitamin D status.",1
"[4142] Endocrine Society Issues Practice Guideline on Vitamin D and the guideline recommend that clinicians screen for vitamin D deficiency in people at risk for deficiency, including obese individuals, blacks, pregnant and lactating women, and patients with malabsorption syndromes.",1
"[43] If electing to test vitamin D status, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the accepted biomarker to be offered early in pregnancy.",1
"[44] Although 1,25(OH) 2D is the active circulating form of vitamin D, measuring this level is not helpful because it is quickly and tightly regulated by the kidney.",1
"True deficiency would be evident only by measuring 25(OH) D. Of note, questions have been raised regarding the need for standardization of assays.",1
A large laboratory (Quest Diagnostics) recently reported the possibility of thousands of incorrect vitamin D level results.,1
Sunlight expo-sure questionnaires are imprecise and are not currently recommended.,1
"There is no consensus about the optimal 25(OH) D level, but many experts accept a range 75nmol/L (≥30 ng/mL) as optimal.",1
"[44] Controversy exists regarding the optimum concentration of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D for defining vitamin D deficiency, especially in pregnancy.",1
Most experts agree that serum vitamin D levels below 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) represent deficiency.,1
However this current practice is based on the skeletal actions of the vitamin and may not be applicable for its non-classic actions.,1
"As was recently pointed out in a Cochrane review, the topic of maternal vitamin D requirements during pregnancy has been poorly studied.",1
The reality is that the actual vitamin D requirement during pregnancy is not known.,1
"For that matter, the requirement for the general population is not known either.",1
"There is no dietary recommended intake (DRI) for vitamin D. What is known today is that for a pregnant woman, the adequate intake for vitamin D is 200 IU per day.",1
"However this recommended level, which was largely arbitrarily set, seems to be less helpful to improve the nutritional vitamin D status of pregnant women.",1
"[""National Osteoporosis Foundation's (NOF) recommends 400-800IU vitamin D for pregnant women.""]",1
"A recent systematic review concluded that antenatal vitamin D supplementation is effective in improving the vitamin D status of Asian and white women, improves growth in the first year of life in South Asian babies and therefore may contribute to reducing the incidence of rickets in this latter group, without evidence of harm.",1
"[""Current NICE guidance states clearly that pregnant women are informed, at their first antenatal booking, of the importance of adequate vitamin D during pregnancy and after, to maintain their own and their baby's health.""]",1
These women are advised to take 10 micrograms per day in the form of a multivitamin supplement.,1
It is crucial to ensure that at-risk women are aware of this need.,1
"Those identified as at-risk include: Women from black and ethnic minorities who are socially-excluded, women with limited exposure to sunlight, especially those who are housebound and obese women with prepregnancy BMI > 30.",1
Current U.S. guidelines call for pregnant women to get 400-600 IU.,1
"However, research in recent years has been challenging those ideas on what is enough, and what is too much.",1
The U.S. guidelines are currently under review.,1
"For now, though, 600 IU in prenatal vitamins remains the recommended daily intake for pregnant women.",1
"However, getting 25(OH) D levels consistently above 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) may require at least 1500-2000 IU/day of vitamin D. If a mother is vitamin D deficient, breast milk is not a good source of vitamin D, so infants need to be given vitamin D supplementation until they are weaned.",1
Also women are encouraged to continue to take vitamin D supplements after pregnancy to help protect against health problems such as osteoporosis.,1
"It was recently shown that a maternal supplementation of 2100 IU vitamin D/day was needed, when administered during the period of lactation, in order to observe an increase in serum levels of 25(OH) D in the breast-fed infants comparable to that observed in children given 400 IU/day.",1
"CONCLUSION\nVitamin D has emerged as something of a wonder supplement, according to the claims of dozens of studies published in the past few years.",1
The current lack of evidence of benefit for women at lower risk of vitamin D deficiency points to the need for further research into vitamin D supplementation in pregnant women with clinical neonatal and infant end-points under scrutiny.,1
"There is a similar gap in the knowledge base for optimal dosing, as there is little empirical robust evidence to support 600 IU/day.",1
"Further research is required, particularly to establish the dose needed to supplement pregnant women with pre-existing deficiency and the optimal gestation at which vitamin D supplementation should be started.",1
"Recommendations should be made on informing women of the importance of maintaining adequate vitamin D stores in pregnancy, particularly for those at greatest risk of vitamin D deficiency.",1
"[""Sensible sun exposure and education of the public about the beneficial effects of some limited sun exposure to satisfy their body's vitamin D requirements should be implemented.""]",1
"Future studies are essential to determine the true vitamin D requirement during pregnancy not only for maternal skeletal preservation and fetal skeletal formation, but also for fetal “imprinting"" that may affect neurodevelopment, immune function and chronic disease susceptibility soon after birth as well as later in life.",1
"The few available studies investigating the reproductive safety of SGAs did not reach conclusive results, and none have compared monotherapy with polytherapy involving other psychotropic medications.",1
"The exposed neonates were more likely to be born premature, were admitted more often to the neonatal intensive care unit, presented with poor neonatal adaptation signs and had higher rates of congenital malformations.",1
All the aforementioned neonatal outcomes were found mainly in the polytherapy subgroup.,1
Conclusions\nThe use of SGAs in polytherapy was prevalent in the assessed cohort and was associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes for both the mother and the child.,1
In utero exposure to SGA monotherapy appears to be associated with less risk to the fetus.,1
"Future research should focus on polytherapy in pregnancy in order to define its reproductive safety and to separate the effects of medication exposure, underlying psychopathology and associated comorbidities.",1
Caption (BOXED-TEXT)\nArticle summary\n\nArticle focuses\nTo investigate the reproductive safety of the second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic (SGA) medications.,1
Key messages\nThe use of SGAs in polytherapy in pregnant women with mental health disorders is presently a common practice and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes for both the mother and the child.,1
In utero exposure to SGA monotherapy appears to be associated with less risk to the fetus.,1
"The reproductive safety of antipsychotic medications should be studied in the reality of polytherapy, associated comorbidities and environmental and genetic confounders.",1
"At present, the largest study to investigate pregnancy outcomes following the maternal use of SGA in monotherapy and in polytherapy, identifying risk behaviours and factors associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.",1
Inability to address confounding by indication and separate the effects of maternal\xa0mental illness and its severity from psychotropic pharmacotherapy on pregnancy outcome.,1
"The women who contacted Motherisk tended to be middle to upper\xa0middle class, whereas a smaller proportion of callers came from the lower socioeconomic and/or immigrant population; however, this may not affect the generalisability of the results, as their outcomes may be confounded by other factors unrelated to the drug effect.",1
"Although the women were recruited prospectively, there are potential limitations in the retrospectivity of a database.",1
The sample size necessary to define a twofold increase of malformation rates of 1–3% above the baseline was insufficient.,1
Introduction\nPsychiatric disorders are among the most common pathologies affecting women of childbearing age.,1
"Recent estimates of the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in pregnancy range from 14% to 30.5%1–3and include mood, anxiety and psychotic disorders.1–4Untreated mental illness during pregnancy is associated with risks to both the mother and the child.5Uncontrolled schizophrenia, depression and bipolar disorder have all been associated with an increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes.6–8The risks associated with uncontrolled mental illness often lead physicians to recommend maintenance of treatment with psychotropic medications throughout gestation.",1
Antipsychotics have been utilised in the treatment of psychiatric disorders for a number of decades.,1
"While the initial drugs, now referred to as first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), demonstrated a profound effect on treatment outcomes, this group of medications is not only associated with serious extrapyramidal complications, but is also known to induce hyperprolactinaemia and to affect fertility.",1
The existing literature on pregnancy outcomes following exposure to FGAs has not shown a significantly increased risk for malformations above the baseline incidence.,1
"Conversely, many FGAs (including haloperidol, chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, thioridazine) have been associated with perinatal complications, particularly when exposure is later in pregnancy.9These include but are not limited to withdrawal symptoms, unstable body temperature, extrapyramidal signs, respiratory distress, seizures and transient neurodevelopmental delay.",1
"Conclusions regarding other FGAs are limited due to either poor methodology or incomplete reporting.9Although the reproductive safety of FGAs is as yet unconfirmed, the adverse side effect profile necessitated the development of newer medications in recent years.",1
"Since the mid-1990s, the use of SGAs has increased drastically and expanded rapidly to the treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders.10–13Furthermore, deinstitutionalisation, the destigmatisation of mental illness and the improved side effect profile of SGAs, particularly the reduced incidence of hyperprolactinaemia in most SGAs, have all contributed to increased fertility rates among treated women.9The rise in birth rate in women with psychiatric disorders, combined with the increase in off-label usage of these medications, has resulted in a significant increase in the number of fetuses exposed to this newer class of antipsychotics.",1
"While SGAs readily cross the placenta,14the existing studies that have investigated the reproductive safety of these agents did not reach conclusive results due to the methodological limitations, small sample sizes and failure to assess SGAs in monotherapy.",1
"The meagre body of literature regarding pregnancy outcomes following the maternal use of SGAs has produced conflicting findings, which may be attributed to the different methodologies and inadequate control for confounding variables.15A number of studies have found that exposure to SGAs is associated with a significantly increased risk of low birth weight16–18and small for gestational age infants, in comparison to healthy controls.17Conversely, Lin et al 17found that the risk of low\xa0birth weight, preterm births and small/large for gestational age (LGA) infants did not differ between women with schizophrenia receiving SGAs and those with the disorder who did not use an antipsychotic drug.",1
"In contrast, Newham et al 19found that neonates exposed to SGAs (n=25) were significantly more likely to be LGA compared with healthy controls.",1
"Furthermore, a large study utilising data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register reported an increased risk of congenital malformations associated with exposure to either a typical antipsychotic or SGA; however, this finding failed to reach statistical significance after controlling for exposure to anticonvulsants.18\nAnother growing concern is the increased use of multiple psychotropic medications in the treatment of mental illness.",1
"A number of studies have shown a significant rise in the incidence of polytherapy with two or more antidepressants, antipsychotics and sedative-hypnotics, as well as an increase in the concomitant prescription of an antidepressant and antipsychotic.151619–24Although polytherapy involving SGAs and other psychotropic medications appears to be increasingly common, no study until now has directly compared the reproductive safety of SGA monotherapy versus polytherapy with other medications.",1
We aimed to investigate the pregnancy outcomes of women receiving SGAs relative to a comparison group of matched healthy controls and to compare the outcomes of antipsychotic monotherapy with polytherapy involving other psychotropic medications.,1
"Women who were exposed to teratogenic medications unrelated to their psychiatric disorder treatment, such as acutane, or who abused substances (eg, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, etc) were excluded from the study cohort.",1
"Fertility-assisted pregnancies, twin/triplet pregnancies or pregnancies with known outcomes at the initial time of contact (eg, contacted Motherisk following the birth, reported abnormal pregnancy screening tests and/or ultrasounds) were excluded from the exposed and comparison groups.",1
"Moreover, control women who reported a history of psychiatric disorders or who were exposed in their current pregnancy to a known teratogen were excluded.",1
"The majority of women in the exposed group reported taking quetiapine (69.9%), followed by olanzapine (16.5%), risperidone (10.5%), aripiprazole (1.5%), paliperidone (0.8%) and quetiapine plus olanzapine (0.8%).",1
"The most common indications for psychotropic medication use were bipolar disorder (36.8%), depression (27.1%), anxiety and depression (9.8%) and sleep disorders (9.8%).",1
"The exposed women weighed significantly more than the controls prior to conception (p<0.001); however, the two groups did not differ with respect to weight gain during pregnancy.",1
The only significant predictor found was group affiliation (p<0.001; Otable 2).,1
Exposed neonates were approximately two and a half times more likely to be premature (gestational age <37\u2005weeks) compared with controls (10.6% vs 4.3%).,1
"We found a significant correlation (at the 0.01 level, two-tailed) between maternal pre-pregnancy weight and neonatal birth weight.",1
Maternal pre-pregnancy weight was the only significant predictor identified (p=0.015).,1
"Although not statistically significant, the rate of major malformations reported in the exposed group was approximately two and a half times higher than in the comparison group (6.2% vs 2.6%).",1
It is important to note that the vast majority of the reported differences between the exposed and comparison groups were found in patients exposed to polytherapy.,1
"Although not reaching statistical significance, more women receiving monotherapy breastfed compared with those receiving polytherapy, and women in the polytherapy group were approximately twice as likely to suffer from hypertension (12.5% vs 5.4%) and gestational diabetes (9.4% vs 5.4%).",1
"Although not statistically significant, it is clinically relevant to report that approximately twice as many neonates exposed to polytherapy were LGA (13.6% vs 6.5%).",1
"All seven major malformations occurring in the exposed group were associated with maternal polytherapy, which reached 8.4% for this subgroup, and no major malformations were reported in the monotherapy group.",1
The observed rate of PNA signs in the monotherapy group was similar to that reported in the healthy comparison group (4% vs 5.2%).,1
"Discussion\nAt present, this is one of the largest studies to investigate pregnancy outcomes following maternal use of SGA monotherapy and polytherapy with other psychotropic medications.",1
"Our data support an increasing trend in the use of SGAs to treat a variety of psychiatric disorders, with bipolar disorder and depression being reported as the two leading indications and quetiapine being the one most commonly used.",1
"We found that 76% (n=101) of women were exposed to SGAs throughout pregnancy and 72% of the assessed cohort received psychotropic drugs in polytherapy, which is in agreement with previous reports.16192122Frye et al 23stated that the proportion of polytherapy treatment increased from 3.3% in 1974–1979 to 44% in 1990–1995.24Recent studies indicate that this trend towards polytherapy continues to rise, reaching up to 80%.22Interestingly, Centorrino and colleagues maintained that there are no apparent advantages in opting for treatments with multiple antipsychotics.",1
"These findings are consistent with recent reports of increased polytherapy involving antipsychotics and antidepressants in the USA,20as well as in other cohorts of pregnant women.14161921\nWe found that women in the exposed and comparison groups differed significantly with respect to a number of characteristics and behaviours that are known to be associated with increased risks for adverse pregnancy outcomes.",1
"Exposed women weighed significantly more prior to becoming pregnant, although body mass index could not be calculated due to the lack of available data on maternal height.",1
"This finding is consistent with reports of significant weight gain induced by SGAs.25–28There were no differences in maternal weight gain during pregnancy, and as such, more consideration should be given to the management of preconceptional weight.",1
"In addition, significantly higher proportions of exposed women smoked more cigarettes during pregnancy and were less likely to breastfeed and take prenatal vitamins.",1
"The increased proportion of preterm deliveries observed in the exposed group may be influenced by maternal pre-pregnancy weight, as was reported in a recent paper by Khatibi et al.",1
"29Moreover, in agreement with a recent population-based cohort study that reported an increased incidence of gestational diabetes in mothers taking SGAs during pregnancy,28the exposed women in our cohort experienced more associated comorbidities, including hypertension, gestational diabetes and hypothyroidism.",1
"Although these latter findings were not statistically significant, they may be of clinical relevance.",1
"However, the exposed group did have a significantly increased rate of LGA neonates.",1
"It is of interest to note that, in spite of the large proportion of exposed women who exhibited characteristics commonly associated with risk for small for gestational age neonates (eg, smoking, hypertension), an increased rate of LGA neonates was observed.",1
Such results may be considered in context with exposure to psychotropic drugs.,1
"Although 14.3% of exposed mothers were also taking an antiepileptic drug, primarily lamotrigine, the reported malformations were not found among those infants exposed to anticonvulsants.",1
The present report is one of the first to compare the pregnancy outcomes of women receiving SGA monotherapy with those receiving SGAs in polytherapy.,1
"Although women from both the monotherapy and polytherapy subgroups did not differ in their age at conception, pre-pregnancy weight, pregnancy weight gain and neonatal birth weight, the women exposed to polytherapy took fewer vitamins, smoked more cigarettes, experienced a significantly shorter gestation, tended to breastfeed less and delivered twice as many LGA neonates.",1
Neonates exposed to polytherapy were five times more likely to present with PNA signs compared with those exposed to monotherapy.,1
"Although some of these differences did not reach statistical significance (table 4), it appears that polytherapy with SGAs and other psychotropic medications may be associated with a higher risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, compared with SGA monotherapy.",1
"The reported results should be considered with caution, given the small sample size of our cohort and that previously published case reports have observed healthy outcomes in neonates/infants prenatally exposed to SGA polytherapy.30–34\nMaternal pre-pregnancy characteristics and behavioural risk factors may be considered when interpreting the findings of the present study.",1
"[""For example, maternal pre-pregnancy weight, specifically being overweight or obese, has been shown to be independently associated with an elevated risk for LGA births.35–38Although this study is the first to corroborate Newham et al 's19report of increased risks of LGA deliveries in women exposed to SGAs, the study design was not able to adequately separate the effect of pre-pregnancy weight on this outcome.""]",1
"Thus, it is unclear whether exposure to SGAs may cause fetal-weight gain directly or indirectly by inducing maternal\xa0weight gain prior to conception.",1
"Nevertheless, the findings are in contrast to a previously published study which found that in utero exposure to SGAs was associated with a significantly elevated risk of small for gestational age births.16However, it is possible that this difference may be due to the lack of control of potential confounders, such as maternal indication for smoking or substance use during pregnancy.",1
"Twenty-four per cent of women in this earlier study reportedly suffered from schizophrenia, a severe psychiatric disorder that is independently associated with an increased risk for small for gestational age and low\xa0birth weight births.17In contrast, only 3% of women in the present study reported a diagnosis of schizophrenia.",1
"Similarly, 38% of exposed women in this earlier study, in contrast to 18% in the current study, reported smoking during pregnancy—a risk factor that has also been associated with elevated risks of small for gestational age39–41and intrauterine growth-restricted42neonates.",1
"Further studies controlling for known predictors of LGA are necessary to confirm the findings, and an exploration of the potential biological mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon is warranted.",1
"To our knowledge, the present study is the first to show a significant association between maternal SGA use in pregnancy and an elevated risk of NICU admission.",1
"The 25% prevalence rate of NICU admissions found in the exposed group of the present study is the same as that reported in a recent retrospective chart review, although only 16 women were assessed.43\nOur results also suggest that polytherapy in pregnancy may be associated with shorter gestation and increased rates of LGA neonates, instrumental deliveries, fetal distress during delivery, NICU admissions and neonates presenting with PNA symptoms.",1
"Such findings may have important clinical relevance, as the rates of many adverse delivery/neonatal outcomes were at least twice as high in the polytherapy group.",1
"Importantly, among the exposed group, all seven major malformations occurred among the 96 women receiving polytherapy; however, no specific pattern of malformation was found.",1
"The association between polytherapy exposure and higher rates of malformations should be considered in the context of the small sample size, severity of the baseline disorder that required polytherapy, associated comorbidities, as well as any other unknown environmental factors that were not assessed in this study.",1
"Considering that exposure to SGA monotherapy was not associated with birth defects in our cohort and that the majority of pregnant women with psychiatric disorders are on psychotropic drug polytherapy, research on the reproductive safety of these medications should reflect this reality.",1
"Moreover, further research is required in order to separate the effects of polytherapy from the baseline mental illness, as well as the genetic and environmental confounders on pregnancy outcome, particularly as those receiving psychotropic polytherapy may suffer from more severe and persistent psychiatric disorders.",1
"The higher prevalence of PNA signs found in the exposed group, compared with the controls, may be driven by concurrent SSRI exposure, as 12 of the 15 neonates that presented with PNA symptoms were also exposed to an SSRI.",1
"Although the measurement scales specific for the PNA syndrome are not available, numerous studies have found that use of SSRI late in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of infants developing this clinical presentation,4445which is also labelled as Prenatal Antidepressant Exposure Syndrome.46The three remaining neonates in our cohort who displayed PNA symptoms were prenatally exposed to an SGA but not to an SSRI.",1
"Similar to the present study, Mendhekar et al 47in 2006 described a neonate who presented with unexplained fetal distress following prenatal exposure to aripiprazole.",1
"Such findings have been echoed by the US Food and Drug Administration in recently issued warnings suggesting that, similar to SSRIs, antipsychotics may cause PNA syndrome.48In the present study, 82.6% of neonates admitted to the NICU were exposed to polytherapy, mostly with SSRIs.",1
"Given the predominance of polytherapy involving these two classes of medications in the treatment of various psychiatric disorders in pregnant women, designing future cohort studies aimed at investigating the relative and combined effects of prenatal exposure to SGAs and antidepressants is of considerable importance.",1
There are a number of limitations inherent in the design of the present study that should be acknowledged.,1
"Given the small sample size, unadjusted models were used in most of the analyses.",1
"Therefore, we were unable to fully assess the influence of confounding factors in SGA monotherapy.",1
Such results should be further investigated in future research.,1
Another limitation is the inability to address confounding by indication and separate the relative effects of maternal mental illness from psychotropic pharmacotherapy on pregnancy outcome.,1
"Moreover, a more detailed investigation into maternal\xa0mental health, which includes measures of the frequency and severity of specific psychiatric symptoms during pregnancy, would allow for a more thorough investigation into these critical confounding variables.",1
"Furthermore, evaluating the social characteristics of the assessed cohort would enable us to identify potential confounding variables that may affect pregnancy outcomes, such as socioeconomic status and lifestyle differences.",1
"The women who contacted Motherisk tended to be middle to upper-middle class, which represents the majority of the population, and may be higher functioning than those who did not, as they independently sought access to counselling in order to help educate themselves on the potential teratogenic risks associated with their medications.16A smaller proportion of callers came from the lower socioeconomic and/or immigrant population; however, this may not affect the generalisability of the results, as their outcomes may be confounded by other factors unrelated to the drug effect.",1
"Although the women were recruited prospectively, there are potential limitations in the retrospectivity of a database.",1
"In conclusion, it appears that psychotropic polytherapy in pregnant women with mental\xa0health disorders is presently a common practice.",1
"However, such management may lead to an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.",1
"Considering that reports that polytherapy do not commonly alter the course and outcome of the baseline disorder,2224indications for polytherapy in pregnant women should be seriously considered and made on an individual basis following a thorough risk/benefit analysis.",1
"The reproductive safety of antipsychotic medications should be studied using a prospective design and a powerful sample size and in the reality of polytherapy, associated comorbidities and environmental and genetic confounders.",1
Born Too Soon: Accelerating actions for prevention and care of 15 million newborns born too soon\n\nAbstract\nPreterm birth complication is the leading cause of neonatal death resulting in over one million deaths each year of the 15 million babies born preterm.,1
"To accelerate change, we provide an overview of the comprehensive strategy required, the tools available for context-specific health system implementation now, and the priorities for research and innovation.",1
There is an urgent need for action on a dual track: (1) through strategic research to advance the prevention of preterm birth and (2) improved implementation and innovation for care of the premature neonate.,1
"We highlight evidence-based interventions along the continuum of care, noting gaps in coverage, quality, equity and implications for integration and scale up.",1
Improved metrics are critical for both burden and tracking programmatic change.,1
"[""Linked to the United Nation's Every Women Every Child strategy, a target was set for 50% reduction in preterm deaths by 2025.""]",1
"Three analyses informed this target: historical change in high income countries, recent progress in best performing countries, and modelling of mortality reduction with high coverage of existing interventions.",1
"If universal coverage of selected interventions were to be achieved, then 84% or more than 921,000 preterm neonatal deaths could be prevented annually, with antenatal corticosteroids and Kangaroo Mother Care having the highest impact.",1
"Everyone has a role to play in reaching this target including government leaders, professionals, private sector, and of course families who are affected the most and whose voices have been critical for change in many of the countries with the most progress.",1
"[""Preterm birth as a marker for women's and children's health\nThe Born Too Soon report, published in 2012, drew global attention to the issue of preterm birth and reported that more than 1 in 10 of the world's babies are born too soon each year, 15 million each year [1].""]",1
"As part of a series entitled ""Born Too Soon"" drawing from the report, this final paper summarises the problem, underlining the need for concerted action on both the prevention of preterm birth and care of the premature baby, to ensure every mother and every baby survives [2-6].",1
"We then highlight evidence-based interventions for preterm birth in the context of the wider health system drawing on the other papers in this supplement, and here we focus on the implications for integrating and scaling up those available interventions in low- and middle-income countries where the coverage of care is lowest and the potential lives saved as a result.",1
"We also consider research gaps since advancing the research agenda is a critical need to reduce the global burden of preterm birth, requiring innovations for both prevention and care.",1
"Finally we detail the analyses for a mortality reduction target for preterm specific neonatal deaths and outline the specific roles all actors must play in this global effort to reduce preterm birth and care for premature babies, which is a marker of the health and care of women and girls, as well as of progress for child survival and development.",1
"[""The actions identified aim to support the goals of the Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health launched by the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in September 2010 to further advance progress for the Millennium Development Goal 4 for child survival and the Every Woman Every Child movement to mobilise action and resources for these goals [7].""]",1
"By pooling our efforts with each organisation playing to its strengths, our shared goal, as epitomised in Every Woman Every Child , can be realised -- a day when pregnancies are wanted and safe, women survive, babies everywhere get a healthy start in life, and children thrive.",1
Accelerating evidence-based action for prevention and care\nAddressing the burden of preterm birth has a dual track--prevention and care (Figure1).,1
"Reducing risks before, during, and between pregnancies through preconception and antenatal care packages may help preterm birth prevention [4,5].",1
"Actions taken during labour and birth, and particularly improved care of the neonate have been shown to have major impact [5,6].",1
"For example, antenatal corticosteroids administered to a pregnant woman in preterm labour can prevent respiratory distress syndrome in premature babies reducing newborn mortality and morbidity [5].",1
"In addition, many of these interventions, such as obstetric care and antibiotics for prelabour premature rupture of membranes (pPROM), also benefit maternal health and prevent stillbirths [8].",1
"Prevention of preterm birth is primarily a knowledge gap\nDespite the burden of preterm birth, few effective prevention strategies are available for clinicians, policy-makers and program managers.",1
"Multiple studies in high-income contexts have attempted to prevent preterm birth, but have not yet identified high-impact interventions in the preconception and antenatal periods.",1
"Many interventions have been evaluated, and some have been identified as beneficial though limited in public health impact, such as therapy with progestational agents, which have only been studied in certain high-risk populations.",1
"Preliminary studies of interventions to reduce rates of elective caesarean births or inductions without medical indication before the recommended 39 completed weeks of gestation suggest an impact on prevention of early term deliveries in some high- and middle-income countries [9,10].",1
"A recent study published in The Lancet examined preterm birth prevention potential in 39 high-income countries and estimated that if five interventions reached high coverage there would only be a 5% relative reduction of preterm birth rate from 9·59% to 9·07% of livebirths by 2015, averting an estimated 58,000 preterm births and saving US$3 billion annually [11].",1
"The limited number and effectiveness of available interventions for preterm prevention further underscores this critical major knowledge gap, and makes the case for a strategic and coordinated research effort to advance understanding of causes and mechanisms of preterm birth and identification of innovative solutions.",1
"However, the low- and middle-income countries with the highest burden of preterm births also carry the greatest burden of higher-risk conditions for preterm birth that are preventable or treatable.",1
"Interventions such as family planning; prevention and management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs); use of insecticide-treated bednets and intermittent preventive treatment for malaria; identification and treatment of pre-eclampsia, and reduction of physical workload are examples of strategies that could improve birth outcomes in in low- and middle-income settings.",1
"Unfortunately, to date, few studies have assessed the impact of these interventions on preterm birth in these countries, particularly with accurate measures of gestational age [12].",1
"The greatest potential for the global prevention of preterm birth, therefore, lies in a comprehensive, strategic, and sufficiently-funded research agenda of the causes of preterm birth and novel strategies for prevention [13].",1
This should be vigorously pursued.,1
There are some significant intrapartum interventions that reduce the impact of preterm birth.,1
"Antenatal corticosteroid injections given to women in preterm labour are highly effective at preventing respiratory distress syndrome in premature babies and associated mortality and long-term impairment, but remain under-used in many low- and some middle-income countries.",1
"There is, thus, a need for delivery research that can help understand context-specific reasons for the continued low coverage in these countries and identify ways to adapt known effective strategies for use in low-resource settings [14].",1
"Tocolytic medicines rarely stop preterm labour, but may help delay labour for hours or days, allowing the baby additional precious time to develop before birth.",1
"Of course, any strategies to prolong labour, including delaying caesarean birth, must be evaluated against the potential risk of continued exposure of woman and foetus to sub-optimal conditions that may result in harmful effects.",1
Further research is needed on short and long-term health consequences for mother and baby from efforts to prevent preterm labour [5].,1
"Care of premature babies is primarily an action gap\nAs evidenced by the large survival gap between babies born in high-income countries and those born in low- and middle-income countries, effective interventions exist to reduce death and disability in premature babies, yet this care does not reach the poor and most disadvantaged populations where the burden is highest [6].",1
"There is a ""know-do gap"", or a gap between what is known to work and what is done in practice.",1
"Bridging this gap will be critical for saving premature babies globally, and must be linked to implementation research and context specific adaptation and innovation.",1
"Most preterm births occur over 32 weeks of gestation (84%), and deaths in these babies can almost all be prevented and in most cases, intensive care is not needed [6] (Figure1).",1
"[""It is possible to implement some evidence-based interventions for the care of premature babies at the community level through behaviour change initiatives and women's groups [16], as well as home-visit packages with extra care for premature babies, particularly breastfeeding support and awareness of the importance of seeking care when danger signs occur [17].""]",1
"However, the highest impact interventions, notably access to quality intrapartum care and emergency obstetric and newborn care [19], require facility-based services.",1
"Antenatal corticosteroids and Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) are evidence-based interventions that are feasible to scale up in low-resource settings and may serve as entry points for strengthening health systems [20,21].",1
"Scaling up preterm birth interventions within the existing health system\nThere is increasing global consensus around essential reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) interventions [22,23], including those to address preterm birth (Figure2).",1
"The goal is to achieve universal, equitable coverage and high quality in all these RMNCH interventions.",1
"Newborn babies, and especially premature newborns, are the most sensitive test of health systems function as these babies can die within minutes without the right care.",1
"For sustainable effect, interventions to prevent preterm birth in the preconception and antenatal periods and to reduce death and disability in premature babies must be integrated within the existing health system.",1
"An effective continuum of care addresses the health needs of the adolescent, woman, mother, newborn and child throughout the life cycle, wherever care is provided, whether it be at the home, primary care level or district and regional hospitals.",1
"Most importantly, they can help prevent stillbirths, improve prevention and care of premature babies and avert death and disability in women, newborns and children [25-27].",1
"Interventions with the highest impact on the prevention of preterm birth and care of the premature baby in high-mortality and lower-resource settings can be integrated into these health service delivery packages, which exist in most health systems and involve links with maternal and child health services, as well as immunisation, malaria, HIV/AIDS, nutrition, family planning, and other related programs [22].",1
"The interventions within each package are based on multiple systematic reviews and are consistent with the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health Essential Interventions report [23].",1
"While these packages may exist in nearly all health systems, lower-income countries cannot scale up and implement all the individual RMNCH interventions within all the packages at once [25].",1
Packages usually are initially comprised of the essential interventions and then increase in complexity over time according to local needs and capacity.,1
"The functionality of health systems, such as human resource capacity, health facility infrastructure, supply and demand systems, financial resources, government stewardship, district-level management and use of data, will also determine the coverage, quality and rate of change within the continuum of care [28].",1
"Closing gaps in coverage, equity and quality\nIn order for health services to save the maximum number of lives, coverage, quality and equity need to be high; thus ensuring high coverage of care means reaching every woman, mother-to-be, mother, newborn, child and family with targeted interventions.",1
"Providing equitable care means ensuring care for all according to need, rather than income, gender or other social grouping.",1
This holds true for the existing inequalities in care within and across high-income as well as low- and middle-income countries.,1
"Previous papers in this supplement have identified gaps in coverage, quality, equity and metrics for care during preconception, pregnancy and care of preterm newborns [4-6].",1
"[""Current coverage levels for eight indicators across the continuum of care, chosen by the United Nations Commission on Information and Accountability for Women's and Children's Health, are tracked for the 75 priority Countdown to 2015 countries which collectively account for 90% of maternal, newborn and child deaths [29].""]",1
"Currently, essential care reaches only half of the people in need (Figure3), and there is a wide variation in coverage levels among countries, with some countries achieving nearly universal coverage and others reaching less than a quarter of the population.",1
"Demand for family planning satisfied and antenatal care coverage, even though feasible through primary care services, still leave out many women, especially the poorest.",1
"In addition, quality gaps are a missed opportunity for reaching families; for example, when a midwife is present at birth but is not equipped to prevent post partum haemorrhage or to resuscitate a baby who does not breathe [5,6].",1
"Substantial progress is still needed for the reduction of maternal and newborn deaths, especially for effective, high quality at the vital contact times (e.g., skilled attendant at birth and postnatal care) [29].",1
"Currently, there are no routine data available for many of the interventions for preterm birth prevention and care.",1
"A research pipeline to address preterm birth\nGreater investment in research and, in particular, into discovery of the many complex and interrelated factors causing preterm birth is needed to strengthen prevention and offers a potential over the longer term for significant reductions in mortality, childhood disability and healthcare expenditure.",1
"For care of preterm babies, the emphasis is on rapidly scaling up implementations, so that the maximum number of preterm babies and their mothers benefit.",1
Implementation research is needed to understand the most efficient means of scaling up evidenced based solutions.,1
"In this way, hundreds of thousands of lives could be saved with the application of current knowledge.",1
"Hence, there will not be a single solution, but rather an array of solutions that address the various biological, clinical, behavioural and social risk factors that result in preterm birth.",1
"This supplement identifies risks for preterm birth and the solutions needed to reduce those risks across the RMNCH continuum; yet for many of these risks, we do not have effective solutions.",1
"A strategic research approach is needed to understand why babies are born preterm or as stillbirths, how to identify women at risk, to test strategies for prevention and care, and reduce death and disability rates for preterm neonates.",1
"For the preterm prevention research agenda, the greatest emphasis is on discovery and descriptive research, which is a longer-term investment.",1
"For the premature baby care agenda, the greatest emphasis is on development and delivery research, with a shorter timeline to impact at scale.",1
"Descriptive research\nImproved and consistently applied epidemiologic definitions and methods, with clearly defined preterm phenotypes, are the foundation for improved understanding of the burden of preterm birth [31,32] and addressing the multiple and often interrelated causes of preterm birth.",1
Simpler and lower-cost methods for measuring gestational age are particularly needed in low- and middle-income countries where the burden of preterm birth is highest.,1
"Social and racial disparities in preterm birth rates are a major issue, yet remain poorly understood.",1
"Another important need is for standardised methods for diagnosing and treating prematurity-related impairment in childhood and more consistent measures and timing for assessing multi-domain impairments [33,34].",1
"Discovery research\nDiscovery research focuses on better understanding the causes and mechanisms of preterm birth and elucidating factors that regulate uterine quiescence, initiation of labour, and the multiple host, agent, and environmental factors that cause aberrations in these normal processes of pregnancy.",1
"Understanding the reasons for racial and ethnic disparities in preterm birth will advance the field of pregnancy health broadly, as well as accelerate solutions for those populations most in need.",1
"A multi-disciplinary approach is needed to identify women at risk and discover new strategies for prevention including potential biomarkers, such as genomic, microbial, immunologic, and hormonal factors.",1
"Although infectious and inflammatory processes contribute to a high proportion of early spontaneous preterm births [35], antibiotic treatment of reproductive tract infections, especially bacterial vaginosis and other remote site infections, has generally failed to reduce preterm risk [36].",1
"Many pre-existing chronic conditions and medical complications of pregnancy may result in increased risk of preterm delivery, such as pre-eclampsia, hypertension, aberrations in placentation and placental growth, diabetes and infectious diseases.",1
"Identifying mechanisms of these conditions, and strategies for early detection, prevention, and care, represent an important need for reducing the global burden of preterm birth.",1
New strategies for prevention are particularly urgent for use in low- and middle-income settings where rates are highest.,1
"Development research\nEquipment and commodities are considered essential for neonatal care units in high-income countries, yet for many such units in low-income settings, basic equipment and essential medicines are not available or functional.",1
"Development of robust, fit-for-purpose equipment, is a critical next frontier for referral care for premature babies in the settings where most die, especially for care in hospitals [6].",1
"Some examples include technologies for ventilatory support, novel surfactant formulations, safe and effective intravenous fluid and drug administration, devices for testing bilirubin levels for jaundice and innovative phototherapy equipment [6].",1
New and effective methods for monitoring and management of maternal complications and preterm labour could make a major contribution.,1
"Commodities, such as antenatal corticosteroids, could reach more women and babies though innovation for example in single-dose syringes or, ideally, needle-free devices [37].",1
"In many high-income countries and those with emerging economies, there is evidence of an increase in late preterm deliveries due to elective inductions and caesareans without clear medical indication [38].",1
More information is urgently needed from both providers and patients on the reasons for these shifts in clinical practice and how to promote more conservative obstetric management.,1
The vast majority of published studies on neonatal care relate to high-technology care in high-income settings [39].,1
"Implementation research from low- and middle-income settings is critical to inform and accelerate the scale up of high-impact care, such as KMC and neonatal resuscitation [19,21,40].",1
"Evaluation of context-specific neonatal care packages regarding outcome, cost and economic results is important, including adaptations such as task shifting to various cadres and use of innovative technologies [41].",1
"There is also a need to understand how to screen more effectively for and treat possible prematurity-related cognitive, motor and behavioural disabilities, including in older children.",1
"In addition, the economics of preterm birth prevention and care, including the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness of interventions delivered singly or as a package across the continuum of care and in different settings and populations as well as the costs of doing nothing, need to be better studied [12,42].",1
"Building the platform to accelerate research\nUnderlying this entire research agenda is the development and implementation of the capacity to advance the science of prevention of preterm birth, manage preterm labour and improve care of premature babies.",1
"Standard case definitions of the types and causes of preterm birth are being developed [31,32] and will be critical to accelerating discovery and making comparisons across studies from basic science to clinical trials and program evaluation.",1
"Multi-country studies in middle- and low-income countries tracking pregnant women with improved and accurate gestational dating may help contribute to improved pregnancy monitoring and a better understanding of all pregnancy outcomes for women, stillbirths and newborns.",1
"Improved communication and collaboration among researchers investigating these linked outcomes will provide an opportunity to accelerate the discovery, development and delivery of innovation, especially across disciplines and between laboratory benches and remote and under-resourced hospitals.",1
"Expanding training, research opportunities and mentorship for researchers in low-income settings hold great promise in developing a pipeline of expertise to advance the science with the skills to use this science effectively to promote change [30].",1
"Potential for lives saved\nTo understand the impact of evidence-based interventions on deaths due to complications of preterm birth, we considered analyses including historical data from high income countries (Figure4), recent change in middle income countries (Figures5and6) and a new analysis using lives saved modelling.",1
"History lessons from neonatal mortality reduction in high income countries\nThe historical data from the United States and United Kingdom (Figure4) shows that a moderate increase in coverage of selected interventions results in a mortality reduction, even in the absence of neonatal intensive care.",1
"A number of lessons can be drawn from this historical data:\nBasic care and infection case management interventions have an effect on neonatal deaths and on deaths amongst moderate and late preterm births, which account for over 80% of preterm births.",1
"More targeted care is necessary for reducing deaths among babies 28 to <32 weeks and this reduction could be accelerated as higher-impact interventions are now known, such as antenatal corticosteroids, surfactant, KMC and other enhanced methods of infant warming and feeding which were not available in the mid-20th century in the United States and United Kingdom.",1
"Intensive care may be necessary to reduce deaths among extremely premature babies (< 28 weeks), who account for 5% of all premature babies though a larger proportion of deaths.",1
"[""Lives saved modelling for preterm mortality reduction\nA Lives Saved Tool ( LiST ) analysis examining projected lives saved with interventions for preterm birth was conducted for 75 Countdown to 2015 priority countries (These countries are: Afghanistan, Angola, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Benin, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, China, Comoros, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Kenya, Democratic Republic of Korea, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mexico, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Sudan, Swaziland, Tajikistan, United Republic of Tanzania, Togo, Turkmenistan, Uganda, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Yemen, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.).""]",1
"The modelling methods have been widely published including discussions of the limitations, which are particularly related to the lack of coverage data for many of the specific interventions [44-47].",1
We considered the period from 2010 to 2015 and then through 2025 to allow for a more feasible time frame to scale up care and progress on the prevention agenda.,1
"The results of the LiST analysis found that 84% of premature babies (more than 921,000 lives) could be saved in 2025 if these interventions were made universally available (95%).",1
"Full coverage of antenatal corticosteroids alone resulted in high mortality reductions, a 41% decrease from 2010 [20].",1
"Implementing KMC alone also suggests that a high reduction of deaths could be achieved [21], averting approximately 531,000 neonatal deaths in 2025.",1
"If these two interventions were added to existing health system packages, especially noting the recent shifts to more facility births in Africa and Asia, then a high impact is possible even in a relatively short time frame.",1
"Note that obstetric care would also have an impact, but is not estimated separately\n\nTargets for action by 2025\nThe Born Too Soon report initiated a process towards achieving goals for preterm birth prevention and presented a new goal for the reduction of deaths due to complications of preterm birth (Figure7) [48].",1
"The latter goal was set through consultation by a group of technical experts, and several analyses were undertaken to inform this target, notably (1) projections by country of the deaths due to preterm birth from now until 2025, assuming no change in trends and assuming expected changes in Gross National Income (GNI); (2) reduction in preterm-specific neonatal mortality if the historical trends from the United Kingdom or the United States (Figure4) were applied or if more rapid recent reductions in middle-income countries were applied (Figures5and6); (3) preterm-specific neonatal mortality reductions predicted based on coverage changes according to the Lives Saved Tool Modelling (Table2).",1
"Scenario 1: ""Business as usual""\nShould governments and the global community take no further direct action to address deaths due to preterm birth, mortality will decline by 24% by 2025 according to an analysis of regional trends over the past decade and forward projection (or 16%, if the projection is based on forecasted GNI change) (Figure4).",1
"Given this scenario and taking into account changing numbers of births, the global total of preterm deaths will not reduce significantly by 2025, with around 900,000 premature babies continuing to die every year.",1
Scenario 2: Countries take action to catch up with top performers within their region\nPreterm mortality could be halved by 2025 if governments took action now to match the top performers within their regions or to match the historical reductions in the United States and the United Kingdom from basic interventions before widespread use of intensive care (Figure4).,1
"The examples of Sri Lanka and Turkey (see Figure5) present examples of significant reduction in mortality, halving deaths in 10 years linked to scale up of intensive care.",1
Even those countries with higher mortality rates that are not yet ready to scale up intensive care could see a 50% reduction as shown in the mid-20th century in the United States and the United Kingdom.,1
"This reduction is achievable with improved essential care of premature babies and better case management of infections and respiratory distress syndrome, especially since the deaths of moderately-preterm babies are the most common and preventable ones.",1
"There are high-impact, cost-effective interventions currently at low coverage [5,6], such as antenatal corticosteroids and KMC, that could significantly accelerate progress, which were not available in the United States and the United Kingdom in the middle of the 20th century when the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) was significantly reduced.",1
"Hence, it would be expected, with the inclusion of these and other innovations, that mortality reduction could be more rapid than for the historical examples.",1
"Scenario 3: Countries achieve universal coverage of basic interventions\nShould governments adopt universal coverage of interventions (95%) ensuring that every woman and child who needs an intervention receives it, then, according to the LiST analysis (Table2) and the historical data (Figure4), countries could achieve an 84% reduction of 1.1 million deaths due to preterm birth complications.",1
"While ensuring a 95% coverage rate is ideal and would result in a major mortality reduction, this process will take time.",1
"Initiating these changes can start to move countries toward their goal of preterm mortality reduction while also preventing death due to other causes of newborn death, as well as maternal deaths and stillbirths, through shared interventions such as skilled care at birth.",1
Call to action\nBorn Too Soon is sobering in the news of a large burden and in the personal stories of loss behind that burden.,1
"Yet this is also a story of hope in the significant opportunities for change, especially as we approach the final sprint for the MDG 4 target and aim to maintain momentum beyond 2015.",1
These first-ever country estimates of preterm birth leave us without the excuse of ignorance [3].,1
"The problem is increasing - for the countries with 20-year trend data, the majority show an increase in preterm birth rates [3].",1
"Additionally, the burden is not shared equally, with the impact of preterm birth falling most severely on the poorest families and in low- and middle-income countries where health systems are less prepared to respond.",1
"Preterm birth is a problem that we all share; therefore, the solutions must also be shared, and won through cooperation, collaboration and coordination of the many constituencies and stakeholders.",1
"A number of specific actions, pursued by all partners and applied across the RMNCH continuum of care, will help prevent preterm birth and associated mortality, and have an immediate, profound and sustained impact on human capital.",1

Differential Expression of Placental Glucocorticoid Receptors and Growth Arrest-Specific Transcript 5 in Term and Preterm Pregnancies: Evidence for Involvement of Maternal Stress\n\nAbstract\nPregnancy-specific stress predicts birth outcomes.,1
We hypothesized that there is a maternal stress-GR interaction that can influence fetal birth weight.,1
"[""This study examined the relationship between mothers' stress and attitude towards their pregnancies, placental glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) expression, and the status of GR polymorphism, with their infants' birth weights.""]",1
"GAS5 and GR α were the predominant transcripts in both term and preterm placentas, with GAS5 being primarily localized in the syncytiotrophoblasts.",1
"In an attempt to mimic moderate and high stress environment in vitro , BeWo and JEG-3 cytotrophoblast cell lines were treated with 10\u2009nM–1000\u2009nM cortisol.",1
"Only expression of GAS5 was significantly upregulated by cortisol in all treatments compared with basal levels, but none of the GRs changed expression significantly.",1
"In an attempt to assess a stress versus gene interaction, we studied four GR polymorphisms.",1
"In the homozygous group for Tth111 I polymorphism, mothers with negative attitudes towards the pregnancy gave birth to infants with significantly lower birth weights compared to women with positive/neutral attitudes.",1
"However, placental GAS5 levels were inversely correlated with maternal stress.",1
This study points towards a potential gene-environment interaction that could be of predictive value for fetal weight.,1
Introduction\nPregnancy is associated with major physiological and future psychosocial changes and adaptation to these changes is crucial for normal fetal development and for healthy infant-mother relationships.,1
Maternal pregnancy-specific stress may be a more powerful contributor to birth outcomes than general stress [1].,1
"To date, four splice variants of the GR gene have been reported, formed by alternative splicing, termed GR α , GR β , GR γ , and GR-P [2].",1
Numerous studies have also reported the expression of different GR splice variants in different cell and tissue types [3–6].,1
"In a recent study by Kino and colleagues it was demonstrated that GAS5 ncRNA may be a repressor for the GR by acting as a decoy “glucocorticoid response element (GRE),” thus, competing with DNA GREs for binding to the GR.",1
Changes in the epigenetic regulation of the fetal GR promoter have been associated with exposure to prenatal maternal stress [9] reflecting a possible effect of maternal stress on the expression and function of the GR in the fetus.,1
"A GR Bcl I polymorphism has been associated with increased glucocorticoid sensitivity and was overrepresented in pregnant women with pathological, fetomaternal immune adaptation.",1
"Indeed, a number of polymorphisms have been described in the gene coding for the GR although it is still unclear whether the variability in the glucocorticoid responses observed is due to the polymorphisms or to other factors [10].",1
This sensitivity could be one mechanism linking maternal stress to fetal development.,1
"Only few of these polymorphisms are functionally relevant and these are the Tth111 I, the ER22/23EK, the N363S, the—already mentioned— Bcl I, and the GR-9 β .",1
"Studies have shown that at least three polymorphisms are associated with altered glucocorticoid sensitivity and also with changes in body composition and metabolic parameters [10,11], which could affect fetal development as well.",1
"[""This study examined the relationship between mothers' stress levels and attitude towards their pregnancies, placental GR and GAS5 expression, and the status of GR polymorphism, with their infants' birth weights.""]",1
We also examined the maternal attitude versus gene interaction in relation to fetal birth weight.,1
"Moreover, we tested the effect of cortisol on GR splicing and GAS5 expression of BeWo and JEG-3 placental cells, in an attempt to resemble a low, moderate, and high stress milieu in vitro .",1
The exact cause of maternal stress was not identified.,1
"[""We also tested the relationships between continuous predictors (women's age, stress) and infant weight, using Pearson correlations and partial correlations (when adjusting for age and BMI) and using\u2009 t -tests for dichotomous predictors (e.g., planned pregnancy) and ANOVA for testing the relationship between attitude type and infant birth weight, while controlling statistically for relevant confounders such as mothers' age, BMI, pregnancy planning, and pregnancy nutritional habits.""]",1
"Expression of Placental GAS5 and GRs\nQuantitative RT-PCR revealed that GAS5 and all GRs were expressed in human placentas ( n = 23); 13 were preterm labor (<37 gestational weeks) and 10 were term (>37 gestational weeks) labor, with GAS5 and GR α being the predominant transcripts.",1
It is evident that the major transcripts in the human placenta are GR α and GAS5.,1
"When relative mRNA abundance was calculated, an approximate 4-fold change in the GR α /GR-P in the preterm labor group was noted compared with the term group.",1
"In addition, a twofold increase in the GR α /GAS5 ratio was also noted in the preterm group compared to the term group (seeTable 2).",1
"In term placentas, there was a significant correlation between GR β and GR γ ( r = 0.580, P = 0.038) and with GR-P ( r = 0.980, P< 0.001).",1
"In the preterm group, the dynamics of GR splicing were altered, since GR α correlated with GR-P ( r = 0.710, P = 0.021) and GR β correlated with GAS5 ( r = 0.792, P = 0.011).",1
"However, no significant correlation was noted in the preterm group between fetal weight or maternal stress and the relative expression of GRs and GAS5.",1
"In the term group, the only significant correlation was between GAS5 and maternal stress ( r = −0.711, P = 0.021).",1
"Due to ethical restrictions, we were only able to assess the expression of GR α / β in 4 term and 3 preterm placentas.",1
"Since GR is present as different isoforms, multiple bands were observed and there was an expected interpatient variation in the protein expression.",1
Scanning densitometry of the bands corresponding to GR α / β normalized over GAPDH revealed no apparent differences in the expression of these variants between the term and the preterm groups (Figure 1(b)).,1
"Strong homogeneous staining mainly in the cytoplasm is detected in the syncytiotrophoblast cells on the outermost layer of the placental villi, with some scattered expression in cytotrophoblast cells (Figure 2(a)).",1
"Using RNA FISH, GAS5 localized primarily in syncytiotrophoblasts (Figure 2(c)).",1
This is a first time that GAS5 localization has been studied in human placentas.,1
GAS5 was significantly lower in expression in JEG-3 cells when compared to BeWo under basal conditions (Figure 3(a)).,1
"For the GRs, significantly higher expression levels were detected only for GR γ and GR-P in the JEG-3 cells compared to the BeWo cells (Figure 3(b)).",1
"When BeWo and JEG-3 cells were treated with cortisol 10\u2009nM, 100\u2009nM, or 1000\u2009nM, the expression of GAS5 was significantly upregulated (all P< 0.05) compared with their corresponding basal levels (Figure 4(a)).",1
"However, cortisol treatments did not exert any significant changes in the gene expression of GR α (Figure 4(b)), GR β (Figure 4(c)), GR γ (Figure 4(d)), and GR-P in either of the cell lines (Figure 4(e)).",1
"In addition, there were no apparent changes in protein expression of GR α / β in BeWo cells treated with 10–1000\u2009nM of cortisol, corroborating the qPCR studies (data not shown).",1
"[""Since the maternal attitude towards the pregnancy was a significant predictor of fetal birth weight, we reexamined this association as a function of the GR genepolymorphisms, resembling a gene-environment interaction and statistically controlling for mothers' age, BMI, pregnancy planning, and pregnancy nutritional habits, to remove any potential sources of statistical bias that could skew our data.""]",1
"Statistical analysis of the maternal Tht111 I polymorphism has shown an inverse correlation between negative maternal attitude and infant birth weight ( r = −0.41, P = 0.030), only in Tht111 I CC polymorphism subgroup.",1
"In Tht111 I CT, no significant correlations were noted, controlling for age, BMI, pregnancy planning, and consumption of fast food during pregnancy.",1
"These data point towards an interaction between stress and genetics, since only in the CC polymorphic GR group did negative maternal attitude predict fetal weight reduction, but not in the CT group, independent of confounders.",1
"[""Hence, the effects of maternal attitudes on fetal weight depend on the mother's polymorphism of GR gene.""]",1
None of the remaining GR polymorphism subgroups demonstrated any differential correlations between maternal attitudes and fetal weight (data not shown).,1
Discussion\nThe present study extends previous findings and provides evidence for the first time how maternal stress and GR polymorphisms can potentially affect fetal outcome together.,1
"As reviewed previously, prenatal maternal stress has been shown to have long-term effects on the psychological as well as behavioral development of the offspring [15,16].",1
"In our cohort, women with negative attitudes exhibited higher levels of stress during pregnancy compared to women with neutral/positive attitudes and gave birth to infants with lower birth weights than those with positive/neutral attitudes towards their pregnancy (500\u2009gr difference [13]).",1
"In terms of the polymorphisms analyses, only the maternal Tth111 I polymorphism was suggestive of a gene-environment interaction since, only in Tth111 I (CC), negative versus positive/neutral maternal attitudes towards the pregnancy predicted fetal weight reduction, but not in the Tth111 I (GC) group, independent of important confounders.",1
"[""These confounders included women's age and BMI and were not explained by gestational age.""]",1
"This is the first time that a gene-environment interaction between a GR polymorphism and maternal attitudes towards pregnancy was found, in relation to fetal weight.",1
To this date there has been some contradicting evidence as to the role of these polymorphisms in fetal outcomes [17–19].,1
"However, controversy surrounds the exact mechanisms by which these responses are regulated.",1
GR alternative splicing might also influence the subsequent activation of signalling pathways by glucocorticoids [20].,1
"In our study, we have shown that all known transcripts of GR splice variants are expressed in the human placenta with GR α being the predominant transcript in all categories studied.",1
These data corroborate a previous preliminary study of placental GRs [20].,1
"Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time the expression of GAS5 in human placentas.",1
We decided to incorporate GAS5 in the current study as it can act as a GR DNA binding decoy and as a result compromise its activity [8].,1
"Interestingly, GAS5 and GR α were the predominant transcripts in both term and preterm placentas.",1
"Here, we provide further information about the regulation of this transcript by cortisol using two in vitro models as it is upregulated by cortisol in a dose-independent manner.",1
This finding provides further evidence of regulation of GAS5 by stress and corroborates initial in vivo data in mice [21].,1
"In this study using C57BL/6 male mice, stress induced GAS5 RNA levels in the hippocampus and this increase was accompanied by a rise of corticosterone levels [22].",1
These in vitro and in vivo observations together are highly suggestive of a functional link between stress and this ncRNA.,1
"In view of previous data in HeLa cells, where GAS5 translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus with GR in response to dexamethasone [8], this colocalization is highly suggestive of a potential crosstalk at placental level between GAS5 and the GR.",1
"Preterm labor is associated with high mortality and morbidity [22] and a recent study pointed towards an association between maternal stress and complications of pregnancy, especially preterm birth [23].",1
"There is some controversy surrounding the exact function of GR β , but it appears to exert a dominant-negative effect on GR α -induced transcriptional activity [8].",1
GR γ is a ligand-dependent transcription factor with reduced transactivating activity and its function is still under investigation.,1
"Similarly, little is known about the role of GR-P, a truncated isoform that lacks a large part of the ligand-binding domain, including the domains for silencing of GR in the absence of hormone and transcriptional activation [24].",1
"In our study, an approximate 4-fold change in the GR α /GR-P in preterm labor was detected.",1
have shown that placental GR-P mRNA levels were reduced significantly after spontaneous labor [20].,1
A twofold increase in the GR α /GAS5 ratio was also noted in the preterm group compared with the term group of women.,1
It is attractive therefore to hypothesise that the change in the ratio of the splicing isoforms alters the responsiveness of placental GRs to cortisol and that this may affect gestational age.,1
"We would like to propose a potential model where, during preterm birth, GR α is the predominant receptor since there is a decrease in negative regulators such as GR β , GR γ , and the “pseudo-GRE” GAS5.",1
These ratio changes will ultimately lead to an augmented response towards glucocorticoids with potential detrimental effects for the mother and the fetus.,1
It is possible that this change of relative transcript abundance ratio might be involved in the correlation between negative maternal attitudes (hence highly stressed) and fetal birth weight.,1
"In terms of the polymorphic study, our study provides a novel insight into the involvement of GR polymorphisms in pregnancy outcome.",1
"We have identified a specific group of mothers (Tht III I polymorphism, CC group) in whom maternal attitudes predicted fetal weight.",1
"In a past study, a similar gene-environment interaction was noted between the ER22/23EK polymorphism and the effect of childhood adversity on depression [17].",1
"We acknowledge that measurement of GR polymorphisms posed certain limitations, for example, the use of cell lines as in vitro experimental models.",1
"Although both cell lines (JEG-3 and BeWo) could represent a cytotrophoblastic milieu in vitro , they have differences in their fusogenic capacities.",1
"In addition, microarray analyses demonstrated that many transcripts were differentially expressed between JEG-3 and BeWo cells [25].",1
It would be of interest to repeat these experiments in primary cell lines of syncytialised trophoblasts.,1
This experiment would provide a better insight into the regulation of GAS5 by cortisol.,1
"However and despite these limitations, there is a wealth of literature using those two cell lines as experimental models to study placental function.",1
It would also be of interest to expand these observations in human myometrium that is a key organ responsible for quiescence and contractility responses and also assess whether changes in GR transcripts are due to labor or nonlabor.,1
"To test this, we have performed qPCR for all GRs and GAS5 in the same cohort of placentas divided this time to labor ( n = 18) and nonlabor ( n = 5).",1
There was no apparent change in the expression of any of the genes in these two categories (data not shown).,1
"Therefore, at placental level, the contractile status does not really affect GR transcription.",1
We acknowledge that our sample included small numbers in certain categories of polymorphic groups.,1
"Moreover, the nature of maternal stress was not identified and further analytical approaches are needed to provide conclusive evidence for a gene-environment interaction.",1
"Nevertheless, the statistically significant effect and the size of differences observed between mothers with negative versus positive and neutral attitudes in the Tht111 I CC polymorphism group suggest that this effect may be robust.",1
"Second, the distribution of Bcl I polymorphism seen in this sample may be unique, since there are important geographical/ethnic differences in the prevalence of these polymorphisms.",1
"It should be emphasized that, in the present study, we included a fairly homogeneous cohort of Mediterranean patients from Crete.",1
"Despite these limitations, this is the first study to demonstrate a gene-maternal environment synergism in relation to infant birth weight, using a very brief assessment of maternal attitudes to pregnancy.",1
"Should these data be replicated in a much wider cohort, given the simplicity in assessing such attitudes and the feasibility to identify the homozygous group of women early on in pregnancy, these findings may have significant implications for public health and prevention.",1
"[""For example, based on the polymorphic profile and our brief assessment of mothers' attitude towards the pregnancy, we could screen noninvasively and identify mothers during pregnancy that may benefit from stress-management strategies, and this could possibly dramatically improve health outcomes for the mother as well as the fetus.""]",1
Body mass index is associated with the maternal lines but height is heritable across family lines in the Lifeways Cross-Generation Cohort Study\n\nAbstract\n\nObjectives\nOverweight and obesity is a problem in children in particular and determining pathways of transmission is important in prevention.,1
We aimed to examine associations for body mass index (BMI) across three generations of the same families.,1
"[""Results\nCorrelation of offspring's BMI with that of the mother increased with age (correlation coefficient 0.15 increasing to 0.28, p value <0.001 in all cases) while no consistent pattern was seen with offspring and fathers.""]",1
There was an association also with each parent and their own mother.,1
"[""Offspring's BMI was correlated to a lesser extent with that of the maternal grandmother while for girls only there was an association with that of the paternal grandmother at ages 0 and 5 (correlation coefficients 0.25, 0.28, p values 0.02, 0.01, respectively).""]",1
"In contrast, height of the child was strongly associated with those of all family members at age 5, but at birth and at age 9 only there was an association with those of the parents and the paternal grandfather.",1
"[""Correlation of offspring's height with those of the mother and father increased with age.""]",1
"Conclusions\nThe results suggest that BMI is predominantly associated with the maternal line, possibly either with intrauterine development, or inherited through the X chromosome, or both, while height is a more complex trait with genetic influences of the parents and that of the paternal grandfather predominating.",1
"[""Caption (BOXED-TEXT)\nStrengths and limitations of this study\nThis is one of the few studies to examine association between grandparents’ characteristics and grandchildren's growth across seven lineages and at three time points.""]",1
"The results of this study are novel, suggesting that body mass index is predominantly associated with maternal pathways, whether through intrauterine development or inherited through the X chromosome or both.",1
"The statistical analysis is novel, using mixed-model techniques that enable all the data to be utilised including incomplete families.",1
"A limitation is the relatively small numbers of respondents with differential response rates at each sweep, particularly when children averaged 9\u2005years of age.",1
A further limitation is the possibility that deceased grandparents would have different patterns of association with their grandchildren than those living.,1
Introduction\nIncreasing body mass index (BMI) and obesity levels in current populations are a source of concern for public health policy in many countries.,1
"There is significant interest in what influences weight gain over the life course and the degree to which risk of overweight or obesity is transmitted across generations of families.1–3From studies that have examined the heritability of BMI,45it is clear that BMI does have a heritable component.",1
"However, the majority of family studies of BMI examine relationships between two generations only and are not adjusted for cohort effects.",1
"Studies in which BMI of children is documented at repeated times show strong tracking patterns with age,6–9but this has not been reported in relation to family lineages including grandparents.",1
There are very few human studies which include three generations of family members and which also collect anthropometric data or study heritability patterns.,1
"[""The Genetics of Pre-eclampsia (GOPEC) consortium studied patterns of inheritance across three generations in relation to risk of pre-eclampsia.10A US study, employing self-reported grandparental data, looked at familial associations for childhood overweight.11In Hong Kong, an economy in epidemiological transition, grandparental and parental education in relation to childhood weight was studied, the parental influence being stronger.12A small number of studies have been reported which examine grandparental morbidity and mortality data in relation to infant birth weight and growth patterns.13–16Most recently, data from the Overkalix study in Sweden, which relates famine experience decades ago with current grandchildren's cardiovascular disease outcomes, suggest that the paternal grandmother's (PGM) exposure to famine-like conditions in childhood was associated with an increased likelihood of cardiovascular disease in her adult granddaughter, whereas the mortality association was limited to grandsons for the paternal grandfather (PGF).1718The maternal grandmother (MGM) may be particularly significant, because she supplies the ovum through the mother to her grandchild, as well as her nurturing role to the mother and grandchild.119Both grandmothers provide an intrauterine environment for the respective parents of any index grandchild.""]",1
"[""Anthropological studies also suggest the particular importance of the MGM for children's development.20\nThe Lifeways Cross-Generation Cohort Study was established in 2001 with the a priori purpose of assessing associations across generations and between family members.21–25We have shown in several previous analyses that there is a stronger association with children's outcomes along the maternal than the paternal line.23–25In the present study, we analyse patterns in BMI and height at three ages of the index child, employing primarily examination rather than self-reported data for adults.""]",1
Our purpose was to assess if there are any similarities in BMI patterns within families and whether similarities are constant over the three time points and across generations.,1
"In order to address difficulties with heritability interpretation, we have employed a mixed-model analysis that uses fixed and random effects.27The family component of variance is partitioned into variances of and correlations between family members.",1
"The baseline BMI at the younger age is included as a covariate to adjust for regression towards the mean.28In this analysis, it can be argued that effects on BMI common to both ages are cancelled and what remains are differential genetic effects, intrauterine effects and possibly environmental effects.",1
"BMI—child age 0\nIn the nuclear family, the correlation between the child and the mother was highly significant (table 4).",1
"When examined by gender, girls were only weakly correlated with the mother, but with boys the correlation was much stronger.",1
These data have a few girls whose mothers have a very high BMI and these values appear to dilute the correlation between girls and mother.,1
"For boys, the correlation with the MGM was significant.",1
"The PGM was significantly correlated with girls, but not boys, at age 0.",1
"BMI—child age 5\nThere was a strong correlation between the child and the mother, similar to that at age 0 (table 4).",1
The corresponding correlation between the child and the father was also significant overall.,1
"[""The child's BMI was also correlated with the MGM.""]",1
Girls were correlated with fathers but not mothers and were also correlated with the MGM and PGM.,1
Boys were correlated with mothers but not fathers (table 4).,1
"There was again a strong correlation of the child with the mother, this time being similar for boys and girls (table 4).",1
There was also a correlation with the MGM for both boys and girls.,1
Boys were also strongly correlated with the PGF at the age of 9 only.,1
The size of the correlation between the child and the mother at this age was similar to that between the mother and the MGM and the father and the PGM.,1
"For girls, there was a significant change with the BMI of the father, p=0.010, and a borderline significant change associated with the BMI of the PGM, p=0.066, but no association with other family members.",1
"For boys, there was a positive change associated with the BMI of the mother, p=0.002, but no association with other family members.",1
"In the analysis of change from age 5 to 9 (age 9–5), BMI change in girls was associated with the BMI of the mother, p=0.008.",1
"BMI change in boys was associated (with borderline significance) with the PGF, p=0.061.",1
"In general, BMI correlations of the child with the mother and MGM increased with age.",1
"[""Other familial associations for BMI\nThe mother's BMI was highly significantly correlated with that of her own mother p<0.001).""]",1
The same was seen for the father and his mother (p=0.008).,1
"Both the maternal and paternal grandparental couples had significant BMI associations (p=0.033 and p=0.013, respectively).",1
Height—child age 0\nThe child’s height/length was correlated with that of its mother and father and not with that of the other family members (table 5).,1
Correlations in the nuclear family were stronger for the girls and there was a borderline significant association of girls with MGM.,1
Height—child age 5\nThis correlation in the nuclear family became stronger at age 5.,1
"The height of the child was strongly correlated with that of the mother and father, being similar for boys and girls.",1
"The mother was correlated with the MGM and with the MGF, while the father was also correlated with his mother and father.",1
"The height of the child was correlated with the height of all family members including all four grandparents, with the strongest correlations being with the parents and the PGF.",1
The results for boys and girls were similar (table 5).,1
"Height—child age 9\nAs at age 5, the child’s height at age 9 was strongly correlated with that of the mother and father and PGF.",1
This was similar for boys and girls (table 5).,1
"However, the girl’s height was more strongly correlated with that of the mother than father.",1
"The size of the correlations, between the child and each parent at this age, was a little lower than those between the mother and her parents and the father and his parents.",1
"For girls, change in height at age 5–0 was correlated with the height of the mother, p<0.0001, and father, p=0.0003.",1
"For boys, change in height was correlated with the height of the mother, p<0.0001, and father, p<0.0001, borderline significance with MGM p=0.080, and with PGF p=0.009.",1
"For girls, change in height at age 9–5 was correlated with the height of the mother, p=0.008, and height of the father, p=0.031.",1
"For boys, the same change was only correlated with the height of the father, p=0.047.",1
"In general, height correlations of the child with each parent increased with age.",1
"Discussion\nThis highly novel cohort study is one of very few human studies in the literature with examination data across three generations and both lineages which can be linked to children’s growth patterns at three different time points.22To the best of our knowledge, there are no other reported human cross-generational data sets in the literature with four grandparental lines and three time points of measured BMI, so this is an original contribution to the scientific literature.",1
This is also highly topical currently.,1
"Wells, in a recent commentary, indicates the need for such cross-generational grandparental data to understand more fully the influence of maternal and paternal lineages on growth and development.19\nIn a previous study employing primarily self-reported data, we showed that BMI appeared to be strongly familial in the maternal line,23and we have shown that familial dietary patterns are also stronger in the maternal line.2425The present analysis of BMI has extended this to include both birth weight and data when the children were aged 9\u2005years and shows this strong maternal pattern consistently for children while height, by comparison, is heritable across lineages.",1
Similar patterns were seen across the generations for BMI and height.,1
"In our original publication, we used examination data at one time point only for the children when they were aged 5; we now report examination data at three separate time points, including a completely new sweep of data when children were aged 9.",1
"It cannot be assumed that in a growing child these relationships with family members would remain consistently the same, in that environmental factors would come more into play as the child grows up.29As children grow older in this study, the BMI relationship strengthens, presumably because of shared dietary environments, and to reinforce this, both grandparent couples also have significantly correlated BMI relationships.",1
This is therefore a novel analysis and a considerable expansion on the previous one.,1
"In the original paper, we used only self-reported height and weight data for all adults, whereas this time we are reporting examination data for mothers and grandparents.",1
"Not alone is this now more robust, but also it is a substantial scientific addition using novel data to build on our previous observation.",1
"[""In this cohort, we have collected detailed information on social and environmental influences on the child's development and in a number of other publications address this question, including cultural and familial influences.""]",1
"[""We have, for instance, established dietary associations between nuclear family members and have shown that maternal pregnancy diet is associated with a number of outcomes, including child's risk of asthma, overweight and obesity.22\nThere are powerful environmental influences at play in familial studies.""]",1
A report of the Young Finns Study followed offspring in relation to parental BMI from 3 to 18\u2005years and later again when children were 24–39\u2005years old.,1
"Maternal BMI was much more strongly associated with offspring BMI than that of father initially, but no differences in parental associations were seen when the offspring became adults.29\nWe approached this analysis looking for consistency and coherence of association as well as magnitude and statistical significance and include also the height analysis, which has the same numbers of respondents, to show that the absence of an association for BMI by comparison is not simply due to a power problem.",1
"While there are, for example, more mothers than fathers, there are relatively less grandparents, and yet both grandmothers do show statistically significant associations.",1
Ponderal index is the clinical measure normally used at birth.,1
"However, we are not seeking to report or measure adiposity in itself in this analysis; for comparator purposes, we report BMI at the three time points in order to compare like with like both (1) in relation to the child over time and (2) in relation to the adults.",1
"Cole et al ,30for instance, concluded that ponderal index was not appropriate for measuring intrauterine malnutrition.",1
"There were no correlations between BMI of the child of either sex at ages 0 and 5 with maternal or PGFs, so this evidence suggests that transmission of BMI is not primarily genetic.",1
BMI of boys was correlated with that of the MGM at two points but was not correlated with that of the PGM.,1
"For the girls, there was a weak correlation with the MGM but a stronger correlation with the PGM at ages 0 and 5.",1
"Thus, this suggests that BMI is not transmitted via mitochondrial DNA or, if so, only weakly.",1
"This leaves the intrauterine environment or genetic transmission on the sex chromosome with evidence suggesting the latter, since there are no correlations with the grandfathers or of boys with the PGM.",1
A recent study17found that female grandchildren have an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality if their PGM experienced a drastic change in food availability in their childhood.,1
"It indicated that X linked epigenetic inheritance via spermatozoa seemed to be plausible, with the transmission, limited to being through the father, possibly explained by the sex differences in the meiosis stage of cell reproduction.",1
A similar explanation is plausible in this study for BMI.,1
We are not basing our conclusion that the maternal line is stronger solely on the fact that the mother–child correlations at age 5 are significant.,1
"We do so based on the facts that the overall maternal–child relationships are significant at all three time points, that there are correlations between all three mother–child pairs, for example, mother–child, MGM–mother and PGM–father, and that, in contrast to height, where both lineages show significant associations, the pattern for BMI is primarily the maternal lineage.",1
"Intrauterine transmission must be considered important as the maternal relationship is consistent at all time points and between each mother–child pair, for example, the mother and her children, the mother and her own mother and the father and his mother.",1
"While there have been conflicting reports in the literature with, for instance, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)3reporting equivalent relationships between the child’s BMI and both parents, the Generation R study2reports that the maternal influence is strongest.",1
A large Norwegian study31has recently reported largely similar father–offspring and mother–offspring associations in adults across cardiovascular risk factors.,1
"However, in 9 of the 12 variables studied, age-standardised correlations were of a higher magnitude between mother and offspring, significantly so for height, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.",1
"As has been pointed out,119the relationship between the MGM in particular, her daughter and grandchild represents a 100\u2005years of nutritional flow, including intrauterine, genetic, mitochondrial and environmental nutritional pathways and these data illustrate this effect.",1
Morton et al 16indicate that population strategies aimed at optimising size at birth require intergenerational considerations for social as well as biological reasons.,1
"[""One key reason we conclude that intrauterine or X-mediated influences are important is because the grandmothers of both lineages, who do not share their grandchildren's direct daily environment, are each exerting an association.""]",1
Most studies do not have grandparental data from both lineages.,1
"[""The MGM could arguably have influenced her daughter's culinary and dietary habits and hence her grandchild's BMI,25but the PGM is associated with the paternal granddaughter and not her paternal grandson.""]",1
"It is entirely plausible that this is biologically mediated, and not purely environmental, as we posit, and was also reported in the Overkalix study.1718\nIn a meta-analysis of 26 family studies,5BMI heritability estimates ranging from 0.24 to 0.81 were reported.",1
Our correlation estimates (corresponding to half the heritability) of 0.25 between the mother and the MGM and 0.26 for the father and the PGM are consistent with these as is the value 0.28 for that of the child at age 9 with the mother.,1
The analysis5reported that heritability estimates rose by 0.012/year throughout childhood (age ≤18\u2005years) but decreased by −0.002/year in adulthood.,1
Our correlation estimates of 0.15 of the child at age 0 with the mother rising to 0.25 at age 9 and averaging at 0.25 in adulthood is consistent with this with the caveat that no change was seen between age 0 and 5.,1
Note that a similar pattern was not seen for offspring and fathers.,1
"Also note that, as in that analysis,5we found no difference in BMI heritability estimates between men and women.",1
"In contrast to BMI, height correlation estimates between the offspring and the mother are quite similar to those between the offspring and the father for each of the three child ages and each generation.",1
"The estimates increased rapidly from age 0 to 5 and then at a slower rate, reaching maximum values in adulthood.",1
The estimates are greater than those for BMI throughout.,1
Modern techniques for genetic analysis create opportunities for understanding the heritability of complex traits and risk for chronic diseases.2732Height is one of the more complex genetically inherited traits because as many as 20 genes—if not more—interact to determine a child’s height.,1
"Geneticists have found genes for height on the 7th, 8th and 20th chromosomes, as well as on the X chromosome.",1
"A recent report shows that combined common single-nucleotide polymorphisms explain a large proportion of the heritability for human height.33What is under-researched to date is the degree to which the X chromosome might be contributing to human obesity.34Unlike other authors,35we did not find heritability for postnatal length to be higher for maternal height than for paternal height.",1
"In our analysis, it was found that the child’s height was correlated with that of all family members at age 5, suggesting perhaps many genetic effects.",1
"Thus, the common estimate of heritability assuming additive genetic effects may not work for height.36However, at ages 0 and 9, height was primarily correlated in the nuclear family and similar correlations were observed for the parents with the grandparents.",1
"Interestingly, the height of the child continued at ages 5 and 9 to be strongly correlated with that of the PGF, not easily explainable by conventional genetic inheritance, though there may be a Y-related influence at play through the father, who himself is highly correlated with his father.",1
"This may be because reported data were exaggerated by the partner or because, for some reason, reported is a healthier group than measured height.",1
"For the small numbers of fathers we measured, there was a significantly lower height than in those we reported.",1
"However, the latter explanation is less likely since the two groups do not differ in weight or heights and weights of their partners—that is, the mother, or heights and lengths of child at age 0.",1
It is well known that male heights tend to be greater in reported than measured data.37Our analysis suggests that it is unlikely that correlations were affected by this feature.,1
"[""Probably the most familiar technique in estimating heritability is parent–offspring regression in which, for example, a trait's heritability can be estimated as the slope of the regression of offspring phenotype on mid-parent phenotype.""]",1
"It has been noted36that if the sexes are not equal in phenotypic variance, then regression of daughters on fathers, for example, must be adjusted for the difference in variation.",1
"Studies on children are likely to be over-representative of individuals from more recent birth years, but the separation of birth cohort and age effects on BMI correlation was possible in this study by including age-fixed and generation-fixed effects in the model.",1
"Our data do have limitations, as they are based on a relatively small-scale cohort with differential response rates at each sweep and the numbers of measured children at age 9 was considerably lower than in the previous sweeps.",1
We agree that caution is appropriate accordingly in data interpretation as the numbers at age 9 are smaller.,1
"In previous publications, we have reported on the representativeness of the participating mothers and children and find, as with many cohorts, that less affluent and younger mothers were less likely to continue to participate, but the baseline maternal BMI does not differ between responders and non-responders.22Also, we only report statistically significant findings which by definition are sufficiently powered when the child is aged 9.",1
"There may be some self-selection bias in relation to participating grandparents, as clearly grandparents who were deceased could not participate.26In previous analyses, we have shown that the original index mothers were representative of the general population,22and our findings were consistent across the three sweeps, so we do not think self-selection can be the main explanatory factor for our findings.",1
"In conclusion, this novel cohort study shows clear familial associations across three generations for height in both lineages, but the BMI pattern is stronger in the maternal line.",1
"Dose-Response Effects of the Text4baby Mobile Health Program: Randomized Controlled Trial\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nMobile health (mHealth) is growing rapidly, but more studies are needed on how to optimize programs, including optimal timing of messaging, dose of exposure, and value of interactive features.",1
This study evaluates final outcomes of text4baby (a text message service for pregnant and postpartum women) from a randomized trial performed in a population of pregnant female soldiers and family members.,1
Objective\nThe study aims were to evaluate (1) treatment effects and (2) dose-response effects of text4baby on behavioral outcomes compared to control (no text4baby) condition.,1
We examined treatment effects and the effects of higher doses of text4baby messages on outcomes.,1
"The main finding was a significant effect of high exposure to text4baby on self-reported alcohol consumption postpartum (OR 0.212, 95% CI 0.046-0.973, P =.046), as measured by the question “Since you found out about your pregnancy, have you consumed alcoholic beverages?” The text4baby participants also reported lower quantities of alcohol consumed postpartum.",1
Conclusions\nStudies of text4baby have helped to build the mHealth evidence base.,1
The effects of text4baby offer lessons for future scalable mHealth programs and suggest the need to study dose-response effects of these interventions.,1

Mobile phones are poised to be powerful tools to promote health in a number of domains and settings worldwide [4].,1
"In particular, mHealth programs have proven effective in drug adherence, as patient reminder systems, and in some areas of areas of chronic disease management, prevention, and control [5,6].",1
"Some of the best mHealth evidence comes from smoking cessation studies [9,10].",1
Free and colleagues [11] systematically reviewed the evidence on mHealth interventions and found that antiretroviral treatment (ART) and smoking cessation interventions had sufficient evidence of effectiveness to be considered for inclusion in health care services.,1
The authors noted that the ART and smoking cessation studies exhibited no evidence of bias and had significant effects on reduced viral load (ART) and biochemically validated smoking cessation [11].,1
"Abroms and colleagues designed and evaluated the text2quit intervention, which delivers text messages using a tailored feedback approach to promote smoking cessation, and found that 11.1% of former smokers who participated in the intervention remained abstinent after 6 months compared to 5.0% among the comparison group [12].",1
Whitaker and colleagues [13] specifically reviewed mobile phone-based cessation interventions and found them to be effective in long-term quitting outcomes.,1
"Although the evidence from mobile phone studies is less conclusive in these areas, preliminary research has shown promise in delivering healthy eating and active living (HEAL) interventions.",1
"Patrick and colleagues [14] found that, compared to control, short message service (SMS) text messaging and multimedia message service (MMS) participants achieved 1.97 kg greater weight loss.",1
A follow-up study among overweight men also found higher weight loss using Internet and mobile phone [15].,1
Hurling and colleagues [16] found that an Internet and mHealth intervention among overweight adults that included reminders produced more than 2 hours more physical activity (PA) per week compared to adults with no access.,1
Joo and colleagues [17] found that weekly text messages about diet and PA behavior promoted weight loss.,1
"Additionally, there have been studies that used combinations of mobile phone and other new technologies for weight control and found positive effects [18].",1
A study of postpartum women employed a team approach to encourage women to use a Facebook app to promote PA [19].,1
"Additionally, there is growing evidence that mHealth programs are effective in promoting diabetes self-management [20], as treatment adherence tools, and as reminder systems for health behavior and treatment [11].",1
"Although the evidence for use of mobile phones beyond these areas is still emerging, the overall trend is that they can be effective tools for health promotion, disease prevention, and as adjunct treatment tools.",1
"Interventions using mobile phones are growing worldwide, and some are achieving significant scale and population-level reach.",1
"As reported by the United Nations Foundation, Project Masiluleke in South Africa reaches 1 million people each day via mobile phone with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention, testing, and treatment information [21].",1
"Although the literature from rigorous studies of smoking cessation, treatment adherence, and some other chronic disease prevention and management studies show that mHealth programs can promote behavior change, more randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed [11].",1
"There is also a need for more studies on what specific features and approaches in mHealth programs are most effective, including studies on the optimal timing of messaging, dose of exposure, and value of interactive feature [23].",1
It represents one of the largest mHealth text-based programs developed to date.,1
"Recent studies of the text4baby program have found that it changes attitudes and beliefs, but effects on behavior have not previously been established [23,26].",1
The text4baby program also offers an example of using behavioral theory to the design mHealth interventions [1].,1
"The program applies and adapts Social Cognitive Theory, the Health Belief Model, and Diffusion of Innovation theory [27-29].",1
"Future mHealth interventions may build on these lessons to engage audiences in health programs through multiple digital channels [31,32].",1
Female service members and spouses of active duty soldiers are a group exposed to multiple stressors that may increase health risks during pregnancy [33-35].,1
"These soldiers and family members could benefit significantly from mHealth programs such as text4baby because it is a free resource and is highly portable, permitting families to receive these messages anywhere in the world where text messages can be received.",1
The present study evaluates the final outcomes of text4baby from a randomized trial of pregnant female soldiers and family members [23].,1
The study tested 2 primary hypotheses: (1) text4baby group participants would demonstrate increased health-promoting behaviors and decreased risk behaviors compared to control at postpartum follow-up and (2) text4baby participants would demonstrate a dose-response effect of receiving the text messages in which higher doses of text messages would produce greater behavioral outcomes.,1
Previous interventions to promote reproductive health care utilization among low- and middle-income women suggested an approximate 12% effect (intervention vs control) of such programs after a 12-month time period [38].,1
Power analysis estimated the required sample to be 996 participants in total assuming a 10% attrition rate at postpartum follow-up.,1
"Also, intervention exposure, as measured by estimated number of antepartum messages delivered and number of antepartum days enrolled in the messaging campaign, were assessed for all study participants in the intervention group.",1
"Based on the distribution of messages, investigators examined estimated dosage levels, dichotomized on whether a participant received lower or higher than median message exposure to messaging.",1
"Exposure was measured by an estimated count of total messages delivered to participants based on service enrollment and end dates validated by the Voxiva text4baby service database, which were linked to individuals and provided to the investigators under the DUA.",1
Investigators estimated the odds of change over time in response to each of the behavioral outcome variables as a function of text4baby text message exposure through use of an interaction term including program exposure and progression to follow-up measurement.,1
"Therefore, a multiple imputation model was constructed to account for missing race and marital status through use of a logit function with parity, age, and treatment status as predictors of both race and marital status.",1
"Following widely accepted practice, Cronbach alpha of .6 was used to confirm interitem agreement for use of the factor in descriptive and regression analyses [39].",1
"However, GEE models using the KAB factor did not show significant results and have not included those data.",1
"The comparison revealed a larger, statistically significant percent reporting smoking in the last 30 days: 15.3% (95% CI 12.08-18.58) in the control vs 9.6% (95% CI 6.95-12.32, P= .048) in the treatment group, respectively.",1
We identified the week of pregnancy in which participants enrolled using the assumption of a 40-week gestation period and subtracting the total number of days between the participant’s date of enrollment and due date recorded by the study site.,1
"In these models, we examined the effects of high vs low dosage of text4baby, as measured by a median split variable in which the top 50% of the distribution of text message exposure among text4baby intervention participants was compared to the bottom half among that same group.",1
"In these models, we found a significant effect of text4baby on self-reported alcohol consumption postpartum (OR 0.212, 95% CI 0.046-0.973, P =.046), as measured by the question “Since you found out about your pregnancy, have you consumed alcoholic beverages?” The lower OR indicates lower odds of consuming alcoholic beverages at postpartum follow-up.",1
"However, of the 128 respondents who indicated zero drinks per day, only 51 (40%) of them were in the control group and 77 (60%) in text4baby.",1
"Discussion\nThe text4baby program is significant in that it represents one of the largest worldwide mHealth programs to date, with more than 800,000 enrollees from inception in February 2010 through November 2014 [40].",1
"To date, there have been very few large-scale mHealth programs shown to be effective.",1
The future of mHealth will include going beyond small-scale pilots and trials and reaching population-level effects through large-scale implementation.,1
"First, it provides a randomized trial of text4baby with a large sample over the full course of the prenatal texting module.",1
The Madigan study was ambitious in that it followed a baseline sample of nearly 1000 women for a total study period of nearly 2 years.,1
"Second, it provides one of the most comprehensive studies to date evaluating the effect of mHealth on the health of pregnant military female soldiers and family members.",1
"As noted, military women’s health is an understudied topic and the multiple stressors that they face compared to civilian women suggest that it deserves greater attention from mHealth and other health studies [34,41].",1
"Third, the study demonstrates a behavioral effect of text4baby among high-exposure users.",1
"Previous studies demonstrated short-term effects on KAB among participants, including the initial outcomes of the Madigan study [23,26].",1
"However, until these results, no behavioral effects had been observed.",1
"We found that among the subgroup of high-exposure participants, text4baby had a positive effect on reducing alcohol use behavior of pregnant and postpartum women.",1
"Specifically, we disconfirmed our first hypothesis that there was no direct treatment effect of text4baby.",1
The GEE models to estimate treatment effects on measured outcomes did not demonstrate any significant postpartum text4baby participation effects on health-promoting behaviors.,1
"However, we confirmed our second hypothesis that there was a dose-response effect of text4baby, with higher levels of text message exposure predicting lower self-reported alcohol consumption.",1
"This was an important focus of text4baby messages, including both recommendations not to drink and also warnings about the health risks of fetal alcohol syndrome for unborn babies.",1
Our results show that dosage was a predictor of lower alcohol consumption response.,1
"Although self-reported alcohol consumption would be expected to be lower after pregnancy given social cues and available information about health risks for all participants, the dose-response effect among text4baby participants was pronounced, as high-dose participants were more than twice as likely to abstain from drinking compared to low-dose participants.",1
"The brief, text-based intervention format of text4baby is consistent with other brief prenatal alcohol interventions found to be effective in recent studies [42].",1
"Moreover, descriptive analysis showed that the quantity of drinking was lower among text4baby participants postpartum.",1
"Although this is not a large number of total messages, it is worth noting that they reinforce information women are already receiving from other sources regarding avoiding alcohol use.",1
"These data suggest that dosage of texts received regarding risks of alcohol use, which included messages regarding risks due to alcohol while breastfeeding, had a cumulative effective.",1
There are several implications of the Madigan study and text4baby for future mHealth interventions and research.,1
"The program addresses a wide range of health topics, as compared to other studies that focused on 1 or a few closely related health behaviors.",1
"However, initial short-term findings demonstrated multiple KAB effects [23], and this study demonstrated a behavioral effect on alcohol use.",1
"Broad, low-touch interventions can be effective and given low participant burden should be considered as scalable program options.",1
There is a need to understand optimal levels of dosage and other factors that affect mHealth intervention outcomes.,1
It is important to recognize that many individuals who use text messages receive large numbers of texts per day.,1
"We did not have measures of total texts or potentially competing messages received by participants in this study, and those are important topics for future research.",1
"Delivering high doses of mHealth interventions has implications in terms of cost, participant burden, and potential “wear out” effects (ie, overexposure).",1
"Thus, identifying optimal mHealth dosages could have potential major benefits for future programs in terms of cost effectiveness and outcomes.",1
"Although this study does not indicate an optimal dose, it suggests the need to understand dosage thresholds and delivery methods.",1
Future research should include more discrete and refined dosage and other optimization studies.,1
"For example, studies have examined point-of-decision prompts to increase exercise and nutrition [43], and use of mobile technologies for health interventions [11,44], but no study has combined both.",1
Text messaging interventions can do much more than simply deliver text reminders—they can deliver right into the hands of highly targeted population the public service announcements that in years past would have appeared in mass media [45].,1
"Future interventions can tailor text message and other mHealth message content (eg, through social media or apps) both to a specific target audience and to an optimal time for delivery.",1
"By getting messages to a specific population group when they are at risk of engaging in unhealthy behavior (eg, teens watching TV, being exposed to junk food advertising, being sedentary and snacking at times such as after school or on weekends), interventions can influence them at the optimal time [46,47].",1
There are 2 important limitations of this study.,1
"First, we had a low follow-up rate and, thus, used imputation techniques to support the analysis.",1
"As a result, the study may be underpowered.",1
"Despite this fact, the overall direction of results was consistent with previous text4baby studies and additionally we found a behavioral effect.",1
"Much of the attrition was attributable to redeployments and, thus, lack of access to participants at the Madigan clinic.",1
"Second, although we observed dosage effects, we are only able to conclude that higher levels of text messages had an effect on alcohol use.",1
This leaves the important question of exact dosage and timing of delivery requirements for future studies.,1
Studies of text4baby have helped establish and expand the mHealth evidence base.,1
"The demonstrated KAB and behavioral effects of this broad, low-touch program offers lessons for future scalable mHealth efforts.",1
The dose-response effects observed here suggest the need to study methods to evaluate exposure and achieve optimal dosage effects in future research.,1
"Program dosage and optimization research should be included to address other features of the mobile phone, such as ubiquity, constant use, and potential to act as a point of decision prompt.",1
"Prenatal Vitamin Use and Vitamin D Status during Pregnancy, Differences by Race and Overweight Status\n\nAbstract\n\nObjective\nWe aimed to study whether prenatal vitamin (PNV) use protects against low 25(OH)D levels in all women and particularly in obese and black women who are both at risk of vitamin D deficiency and poor pregnancy outcomes.",1
We used multivariable logistic regression to analyze associations of PNV use and odds of vitamin D deficiency defined as 25(OH)D levels < 50 nmol/L.,1
"PNV use among black women was not associated with vitamin D deficiency (adjusted OR 1.0, 95%CI 0.4, 2.3) but was among white women (3.5, 95%CI 2.1, 5.8)(Interaction P<0.01).",1
Conclusions\nOngoing trials of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy should consider potential effect modification by race/ethnicity.,1
"Introduction\nPerinatal health outcomes vary dramatically by race in the United States.1African American women develop preeclampsia more often than their white counterparts2and are more likely to develop preterm labor.3The result is that black infants are 60% more likely be preterm and four times more likely to die due to prematurity than white infants.1Because of less efficient vitamin D synthesis in the skin of darker pigmented individuals, African Americans are at higher risk than white Americans of vitamin D deficiency.4,5Black women are also more likely than white women to be overweight or obese6which is of concern because obesity is another risk factor for vitamin D deficiency5,7and poor perinatal outcomes.8In observational studies, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels have been shown to be associated with higher risk of several adverse perinatal outcomes including gestational diabetes9,10, preeclampsia,11preterm birth12and small-for-gestational age status.13,14,15,16,17Because of the paucity of vitamin D trial data with respect to perinatal outcomes, whether differences in vitamin D status during pregnancy explains or partially explains perinatal disparities is plausible18but remains unknown.",1
"Furthermore, while multivitamin intake has been shown to vary by race,19it remains unknown whether multivitamin intake improves vitamin D status among the highest risk groups (African Americans and overweight/obese) during pregnancy.",1
The object of this study was to examine whether women who reported taking a prenatal vitamin had lower risk of low 25(OH)D levels.,1
Our hypothesis was that lack of prenatal vitamin (PNV) use would be associated with vitamin D deficiency (defined as <50 nmol/).,1
"We defined vitamin D deficiency as <50 nmol/L, a common cut-point in the literature.5,22,23\n\nStatistical analyses\nFirst, we analyzed bivariate associations between 25(OH)D category and PNV use as well as covariates including maternal age, race/ethnicity, smoking, education and BMI.",1
Women with missing covariates were not included in final multivariable models.,1
"Older, white, lean and better educated women were more likely to report PNV use (Table 1).",1
"In unadjusted bivariate analyses, black women, overweight/obese women, less educated women, and younger women were more likely to have low 25(OH)D levels (Table 2).",1
"Further adjustment for maternal age, education, smoking status, BMI and race/ethnicity race/ethnicity attenuated these estimates but women reporting no PNV use still had significantly higher odds of 25(OH)D levels<50 (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.5, 3.0).",1
"In other words, early PNV use was associated with vitamin D sufficiency earlier in pregnancy but not later in pregnancy (Table 4).",1
"Because we were concerned that ever-users included a heterogeneous category of PNV users including women who only used before pregnancy or only after pregnancy diagnosis, we compared this estimate to an analogous model comparing women who used both before and after pregnancy diagnosis (always users, n=477) to never users (n=256).",1
"When then we stratified by overweight/obesity status, we found that among women with BMI >25 kg/m2 lack of PNV use was associated with higher odds of 25(OH)D levels <50 nmol/L during the first trimester(seasonally-adjusted OR 4.1, 95% CI 2.7, 6.3)and later in pregnancy (OR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.6, 3.7).",1
"Among women with BMI < 25 kg/m2, lack of PNV use was associated with higher odds of 25(OH)D levels <50 nmol/L during the first trimester (seasonally adjusted OR 3.0, 95% CI: 1.9, 4.8), but not at the later time point (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.9, 2.3).",1
"When we stratified by race/ethnicity status, we found that for black women, lack of PNV use was not associated with significantly higher seasonally-adjusted odds of 25(OH)D levels <50 nmol/L early in pregnancy (OR 1.0 (0.4, 2.3) (Table 3).",1
"In contrast for white women, lack of PNV use was associated with significantly higher seasonally-adjusted odds of 25(OH)D levels <50 nmol/L early (OR 3.5, 95% CI 2.1, 5.8) (Interaction P value 0.01).",1
"Discussion\nOur data suggest that while prenatal PNV use is associated with lower odds of vitamin D deficiency, the association is not uniform.",1
Both overweight/obesity as well as darker skin pigmentation are both well-established risk factors for vitamin D deficiency.,1
"While lack of PNV use among overweight/obese pregnant women was associated with higher odds of low 25(OH)D levels, this was not the case for black women, who were less likely to take PNV’s compared to white women.",1
Our data are consistent with other similar cohort data.,1
"In another study of Massachusetts women, black women reported taking periconceptional multivitamins half as often as white women.19Additionally, our prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is similar to that reported in NHANES24and in another Boston cohort, Project Viva.13,25Others have analyzed the association between PNV use and vitamin D status.",1
"Shea et al studied 2500 elderly adults and found that lack of PNV use was associated with higher odds of vitamin D insufficiency (<75 nmol/L) in both black (5.2 (95% CI: 3.5, 7.7)) and white participants (OR 2.6, 95% CI: 2.0, 3.2), however these subjects were much older and not pregnant.26A small Turkish study of 79 pregnant women showed significantly higher 25(OH)D levels among women reporting PNV use in the third trimester,27but this study did not include women of African descent and did not have the power to address potential interaction by BMI.",1
"Similarly Holmes et al reported higher 25(OH)D levels among pregnant women taking PNV in a longitudinal study, but only included Caucasian women.23\nOur study has several strengths including 25(OH)D concentrations at two separate time points, self-reported race/ethnicity, and measured height and weight during the first trimester and weight at subsequent visits.",1
Our study has limitations associated with self-report of PNV use which could differ from actual use.,1
"Additionally we lacked data on sun exposure, actual skin pigmentation or food intake which contribute to 25(OH)D concentration.",1
"However, our data remain relevant because PNV use is likely to be more modifiable than latitude of residence, skin pigmentation, sun exposure which should be limited due to skin cancer risk, or even dietary patterns which can be difficult to change.",1
Our study is also limited by lack of detailed data about PNV use.,1
"We had no information as to the duration of use or the vitamin D dose in the PNV which typically is 400–600 IU per tablet, but can vary.",1
We did not have data on whether women were taking separate calcium or vitamin D supplements beyond what is contained in PNVs.,1
We also had no information on frequency of use which could have varied from daily to sparse use.,1
Our findings could be affected by unmeasured or inadequately measured confounding variables such as socioeconomic status which could vary by weight and race and could possibly affect self-report of PNV use.,1
We also lacked data on vitamin D binding protein which may differ by race/ethnicity and could affect the association between PNV use and 25(OH)D measured in the plasma.,1
"The optimal method of vitamin D measurement remains controversial, but our laboratory uses U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology level 1 and this method is commonly used clinically and in the literature.",1
"Lastly, we are not suggesting the futility of PNV use in black women.",1
"In contrast, our data support investigation into higher doses of vitamin D in subgroups at high risk if benefits are demonstrated by ongoing trials in pregnancy of achieving higher 25(OH)D levels.",1
Future analyses of health effects of vitamin D status in this population are planned but beyond the scope of this analysis.,1
"In conclusion, we found that lack of PNV use during pregnancy was associated with vitamin D deficiency early in pregnancy, but not among black women.",1
"In light of two recent meta-analyses/systematic reviews concluding that low 25(OH)D levels during pregnancy are associated with several morbidities in pregnancy15,16, optimizing vitamin D status during pregnancy may be important.",1
Ongoing trials of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy should consider effect modification by race/ethnicity.,1
The Role of Vitamin D in Reproductive Health—A Trojan Horse or the Golden Fleece?,1
"Abstract\nIn the last decade, vitamin D was in the spotlight in many fields of research.",1
"Despite numerous publications, its influence on reproductive health remains ambiguous.",1
This paper presents an up-to-date review of current knowledge concerning the role of cholecalciferol in human reproduction.,1
"Vitamin D deficiency, defined as serum concentration of 25-hydroxycalciferol of less than 50 nmol/L, is commonly noted more frequently than only in fertility clinic patients.",1
It is a global trend that is observed in all age groups.,1
"Most experts agree that vitamin D supplementation is a necessity, particularly in women suffering from obesity, insulin resistance or small ovarian reserve, as well as in men with oligo- and asthenozoospermia if serum concentration should fall below 50 nmol/L (normal range up to 125 nmol/L).",1
High concentration of vitamin D and its metabolites in decidua during the 1st trimester suggests its important role in the implantation process and a local immunological embryo-protection.,1
"On the other hand, evidence-based research did not prove a significant difference so far in ovulation stimulation or embryo development depending on vitamin D level.",1
"In one of the publications, it was also found that vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) has a molecular similarity to anti-sperm antibodies, and another one concluded that both low (<50 nmol/L) and high (>125 nmol/L) concentration of vitamin D are associated with decreased number and quality of spermatozoa in semen.",1
"Vitamin D is definitely not a Trojan Horse in reproductive health, since there were no adverse effects reported for vitamin D intake of up to 10,000 IU/day, but to proclaim it the Golden Fleece, more evidence is needed.",1
"Introduction\nThe role of vitamin D in fertility treatment has been recently described in some comprehensive reports [1,2].",1
"Numerous publications proclaim this particle a panacea for various mental and somatic chronic diseases, while other advise caution in prescribing it to some groups of patients.",1
What is the role of cholecalciferol in human reproduction?,1
"Should its supplementation become a golden standard in fertility treatment, or do we still need more evidence on its effect?",1
"Today we know that, in a healthy woman, vitamin D serum concentration is higher than in patients suffering from polycystic ovaries syndrome (PCOS).",1
"Vitamin D activity pathways in patients with PCOS remain unknown, but cholecalciferol supplementation improves their insulin resistance and the effects of infertility treatment.",1
"Vitamin D stimulates anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) production as well, which is highly correlated with ovarian reserve preservation.",1
"Likewise, in patients with vitamin D deficiency, a higher occurrence of uterine myomas is observed—another established reason for infertility.",1
"Moreover, it was found that a high concentration of calcidiol is related to greater endometriosis incidence, which was explained by diminishing elimination of endometrial cells that pass to the peritoneal cavity via ovarian reflux.",1
"Like females, male low (<50 nmol/L) and high (>125 nmol/L) vitamin D serum concentrations decrease not only spermatozoa count but also their progressive movement as well as increasing morphology abnormalities.",1
"Therefore, a clinician must be careful when prescribing vitamin D preparations, especially in male patients.",1
"Background: Since classical development of medicine in 1920, Vitamin D (cholecalciferol, VD) was strongly associated with rickets, after observation that cod liver consumption leads to a regression in rickets symptoms [3].",1
"However, in developing countries, it is still a common problem in the pediatric population [4,5].",1
"Currently, researchers are attempting to reveal the non-classical influence of cholecalciferol on health.",1
"Lower vitamin D levels have been found in many autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, autoimmune thyroid diseases [6,7].",1
"Since 2013, the database of the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health (PubMed) has gained 2050 new publications about vitamin D and contains 62,427 articles regarding this subject.",1
"Research on the role of vitamin D in reproduction process modulation seems especially interesting; their conclusions presumably have a significant practical meaning in infertility treatment, a serious medical problem affecting up to 53 million people worldwide [8].",1
"For the time being, we know that vitamin D exists in two forms: vitamin D2(ergocalciferol) and D3(cholecalciferol).",1
"An optimal level of vitamin D concentration in blood serum should range between 50 and 125 nmol/L [10], even though some environmental studies imply that the target level should be set much higher—up to 250, or even at 300 nmol/L [11,12].",1
"The effect of vitamin D on ovarian granulosa cells responsible for steroidogenesis, as well as on immune system regulation, was established after finding 1-α-hydroxylase and VDR receptors in deciduae, placentas, ovaries, endometriums and pituitary glands, and was confirmed in vitro by demonstrating active metabolites of vitamin D such as 1,25[OH]2D and 24,25[OH]2D in mentioned tissues [14,15,16,17,18].",1
"It is known that 1,25[OH]2D is responsible for increasing intracellular Ca+2concentration and the activity of acrosine, which is accountable for acrosome reactions that are essential for the fertilization process.",1
"An active form of 1-α-hydroxylase in sperm proves the existence of local synthesis of cholecalciferol and strongly suggests its paracrine effect on spermatogenesis as described inFigure 1[19,20].",1
Methods\nThis article presents an up-to-date review of publications describing the function of cholecalciferol in reproduction and its place in infertility treatment.,1
"Many of them contradict each other, or are at least incoherent.",1
"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome\nPCOS is the most often diagnosed endocrinological disorder in women in their reproductive period, affecting 15%–20% of population, according to the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology standards [21].",1
"Other commonly used guidelines are Rotterdam and Androgen Access Society criteria [22,23].",1
PCOS is very heterogonous and it is often impossible to determine the cause-effect relation between clinical symptoms and biochemical disorders [24].,1
"Since our previous review [2], two new original papers have been published, explaining the significance of vitamin D in PCOS pathogenesis.",1
"They suggest that VD changes AMH production patterns in ovarian granulose cells and alters follicle stimulating hormone (FHS) sensitivity, possibly playing a role in ovarian follicle development.",1
"In healthy controls, 25[OH] D has shown to be positively correlated with AMH status, presenting seasonal variance [25].",1
"In the second piece of research, VD supplementation was proven to increase serum levels of pro-inflammatory advanced glycation end products receptor (sRAGE), a particle binding those glycation end products (AGEs), which are known to be one of PCOS triggers ( p = 0.03).",1
"At the same time, it decreases serum AMH levels ( p< 0.001), which are often elevated in those women [26].",1
"AMH level reduction and an increase of circulating sRAGE after VD3exerted an anti-inflammatory action, which may lead to improved folliculogenesis in PCOS patients.",1
"VD serum levels are inversely proportional to blood pressure, lipid levels, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome symptoms in PCOS patients [27,28,29,30].Figure 2shows how VD deficiency, together with obesity, may increase insulin resistance and deplete glucose transport through cellular walls—VD stimulates insulin receptor expression and insulin secretion [31].",1
"In infertility studies, VD level was described as a predictor for ovulation stimulation success with the use of clomiphene citrate (CC).",1
"An unequivocal positive correlation was stated between VD3level and the development of functional ovarian follicles, percentage of pregnancies, as well as proper body mass index (BMI) [28].",1
"Another study demonstrated that, in obese women, the concentration of VD was considerably lower in patients with PCOS, which may prove its role in PCOS development [32].",1
"In the light of provided evidence, VD supplementation was incorporated in the schemes of PCOS treatment.",1
Uterine Myomas\nLast year gave us a new insight on VD-related gene polymorphism and the risk of uterine myomas (UM).,1
It was earlier observed that lower concentration of VD is typical for women with fibroids (44.9 ± 19.2 vs .,1
It has long been known that African Americans are two to three times more prone to myomas than European Americans.,1
This is concomitant with observational data showing that mean 25[OH] D concentrations in African Americans are near 40 nmol/L compared to about 65 nmol/L for white Americans [34].,1
A recent study on gene polymorphism in 2232 postmenopausal women has proven that two single nucleotide polymorphisms are significantly associated with UM.,1
"Gene rs12800438 is correlated with higher serum 25[OH] D levels, and gene rs6058017 - with lighter skin pigmentation [35].",1
"Currently conducted animal studies provide data on probable therapeutic use of paricalcitol, a VD3analog with lower calcemic activity, in uterine fibroid treatment [36].",1
"So far, no human studies have been published concerning this compound, and ulipristal acetate remains our main weapon against UM.",1
"Endometriosis\nA paper published last year, entitled: “1-alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 regresses endometriotic implants in rats by inhibiting neovascularization and altering regulation of matrix metalloproteinase” sets a new direction in VD research [37].",1
"Up to this moment, researchers were focused on immunomodulating effect of vitamin D on endometriosis.",1
It was confirmed that abnormally high VD concentration causes impaired elimination of endometrium cells passing to the peritoneal cavity via ovarian reflux [38].,1
Those two publications only seemingly contradict each other.,1
"An increased calcidiol level increases the risk of endometriosis occurrence, but in already existing cysts, it is a powerful inhibitor of neovascularization.",1
"No matter which angle we choose to look at for endometriosis, it is a disease caused by metabolic and biochemical imbalance.",1
"Therefore, determining VD status of those patients is so important.",1
This complicated relationship is well described in some recent review publications [40].,1
"Premature Ovarian Failure\nPremature ovarian failure, defined as starting the menopausal period before the 40th year of life, can also be influenced by VD level.",1
"Except for the age factor, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is well recognized as the biochemical marker of this syndrome [41].",1
"AMH is produced by ovary granulosa cells irrespective of stimulation with gonadotropins, but, as stated above, it may be triggered by VD supplementation.",1
It is responsible for the stimulation of primary follicles in the ovaries and their susceptibility to FSH.,1
"In assisted reproduction, it is widely used as a parameter of ovarian reserve [43].",1
"In linear regression analysis serum, vitamin D level positively correlated with total testosterone ( p< 0.001) and free androgen index ( p< 0.001).",1
Authors suggest that VD may increase fertility through the modulation of androgen activity [44].,1
The direct effect of vitamin D on AMH level and follicle development was also confirmed in a recently published in vitro experiment [45].,1
The correlation between VD and AMH was confirmed in a multi-center study in patients over their 40th years of life.,1
"The authors of the study suggest a direct effect of vitamin D on AMH production, and thus longer maintenance of ovarian reserve in the patients with its higher concentration [46].",1
Male Infertility Factor\nShould males visiting infertility clinics be treated with VD preparations?,1
The critical review of the available literature does not provide a consistent answer to this question.,1
"Recent animal studies proved that sperm count, motility, histological structure of testis, and spermatogenesis are more dependent on proper serum calcium and phosphorus levels rather than VD status [47].",1
"Authors state that the proliferation of spermatogenic cells was decreased with calcium-dependent down regulation of cyclin E and CDK2, and up regulation of p53 and p21 expression, which is not a direct effect of active vitamin D deficiency.",1
Similar results have been reported in human subjects.,1
"According to a study on 300 men, Bloomberg concluded that 1,25(OH)D3increased intracellular calcium concentration and sperm motility and induced the acrosome reaction in mature spermatozoa.",1
"VD serum levels were positively associated with sperm motility [48,49].",1
"Earlier research suggested the adverse effect of vitamin D on fertility after a discovery of a molecular similarity of its transporting protein, the vitamin D binding protein (VDBP), to anti-sperm antibodies.",1
"Luckily, for the time being the in vitro experiments did not prove cross-reaction of specific immunoglobulin with VDBP [50].",1
Fertility cannot be the only concern of a physician consulting male patients.,1
"Infertile males with oligo-, astheno-, terato- and normospermia present a higher risk of osteoporosis and have lower bone mineral density (BMD) proportionally to testosterone and VD concentration ( p< 0.01) in comparison with healthy controls at the same age.",1
Significantly lower serum testosterone concentration is associated with lower BMD measured densitometrically in the lumbar spine and iliac bone ( p< 0.05).,1
"A strong, positive correlation between the concentration of VD and sperm motility and morphology was also found ( p< 0.05).",1
"According to the recent studies [47], we can suggest that it was not a result of direct VD action, but its role in ion homeostasis [51].",1
The correlation between testosterone and VD has not been observed yet in another study conducted in Denmark on 307 fertile men.,1
The lower serum VD level was also related to worse sperm parameters [52].,1
Another study describes what we have already learned from the paragraph on endometriosis.,1
"A study on hormonal factors in 147 males, selected from 170 volunteers, homogenous according to age (29 ± 8.5 years), BMI (24.3 ± 3.2) and stimulants intake demonstrated an abnormal (both low (<50 nmol/L) and high (>125 nmol/L) concentration of VD which negatively affected the sperm count, motility and morphology [53].",1
Vitamin D Effect on In Vitro Fertilization\nVD insufficiency has been in the spotlight of in vitro fertilization (IVF) researchers for many years.,1
"Previously, most investigators wanted to determine the relationship between concentration of calcidiol in serum and follicular fluid.",1
Serum VD level correlated well with its follicular concentration ( p = 0.001) and was inversely proportional to BMI of the patients ( p = 0.04) [54].,1
"As stated in the previous report [2], much higher concentrations of follicular VD were found in Caucasians (76.1 ± 32.3 nmol/L) compared to people of African descent (47.1 ± 21.2 nmol/L, p = 0.001).",1
"Today, we know it is directly associated with rs6058017 gene polymorphism [35].",1
The VD levels in patients with clinical pregnancy (30.95%) were significantly higher ( p = 0.01) compared to those with early spontaneous abortion.,1
Patients with high initial VD levels (267.8 ± 66.4 nmol/L) had a four time better chance ( p = 0.02) for successful IVF procedure compared to the group with low VD levels (104.3 ± 21 nmol/L) [54].,1
"In 2012, similar results were obtained from a group of 188 IVF-treated females in a tertiary academic center.",1
"This time, a significant difference in VD levels was found between Caucasian and Asian women ( p = 0.001).",1
"It is interesting that in the Caucasian population, the chance of achieving clinical pregnancy (defined as fetal heartbeat visible in ultrasound at 7–8 weeks of gestation) increased with VD serum levels, while in Asians the reverse relationship was demonstrated [55].",1
"After cross analysis including the number and quality of transferred embryos, it was shown that the patients with proper VD levels have a four time higher chance for a successful procedure.",1
"Until 2014, it remained unknown which element—endometrial or egg quality—is more affected by VD deficiency.",1
"In this study, VD levels were estimated in donor’s serum before the embryo transfer.",1
"This very clever approach gave the authors of these, and of other similar studies from both Europe and the USA, reasons to state that their data strongly suggest that the effects of vitamin D may be mediated through the endometrium, not the follicle or oocyte [56,57].",1
Why is the Endometrium So Susceptible to VD Levels?,1
VD analog supplementation proved to be effective not only in fertility treatment but also in the prevention of type 1 diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and the prolongation of survival of syngeneic islets grafts [58].,1
"High VD serum levels and their derivatives are found in human decidua from the 1st trimester of pregnancy, which strongly suggests its contribution in the implantation process and a local immunological preference of the embryo.",1
"It has been proven that the synthesis of VD is higher in the 1st trimester (41 ± 11.8 fMole/h/mg) compared to the 3rd trimester (8 ± 4.4 fMole/h/mg, p< 0.05).",1
Quantitative analysis with RT-PCR showed higher gene expression of CYP27B1 in both stromal cells CD10+VEand CD10−VEin the 1st trimester of pregnancy.,1
The immunomodulating role of vitamin D was also confirmed by stimulation of NK cells (Natural Killer CD56+ve) isolated from the 1sttrimester decidua.,1
"As stated by the authors, the results of their study prove an increased production of active form of vitamin D in the first trimester decidua, which modulates reactions in a paracrine manner between the mother’s and the embryo’s immune system during the implantation.",1
"Disruptions of the process of major neovascularization can lead to serious pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia (PE) in further gestation.",1
"However, a clinical study that included 280 pregnant women did not demonstrate correlations between concentrations of VD and PE [59], probably due to its multi-causal etiology.",1
"Some earlier experiments, in which the serum and follicular fluid VD levels were compared with the pregnancy rate, did not show the same results.",1
"The serum and follicular fluid VD levels were in significant correlation, with p< 0.0000, but fertilization (43.17%, 53.37%, 58.77%, respectively) and implantation percentages (17.33, 15.26, 18.75%, respectively) did not present any significant correlation ( p> 0.5) [60].",1
Do we know how VD levels impact the oocyte quality?,1
Examination for concentration of VD2and glucose of follicular fluid in 101 patients treated with IVF-ICSI method reported poorer quality of embryos ( p = 0.01) and a lower rate of clinical pregnancies (14.5%) in patients with VD levels exceeding 75 nmol/L.,1
Meticulous observation should include seasonal and regional patterns.,1
"In a study of 188,075 cases, significant variations of semen characteristics have been observed with a clear improvement of sperm morphology in August [62].",1
"The clinic’s geographical location (region) should also be analyzed, because the midyear UVB intensity and VD intake in diet are different between populations.",1
"UVB intensity is a positive predictor of live birth following fresh ET, whereas altitude and annualized average regional temperature have an inverse relationship with live birth ratio following fresh ET [63].",1
Complex evaluation of vitamin D activity mechanism on fertility requires further studies.,1
Examining large groups of VD-deficient patients should not be a problem—most societies are VD-deficient either way.,1
"Epidemiological studies have shown that VD deficiency increases not only infertility rate but also the risk of serious pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia and preterm birth [64].",1
This is why even during the most physiological pregnancy vitamin D supplementation in the amount of 800–1000 IU daily is highly recommended [65].,1
"Even though some negative outcomes with U-shaped associations were observed, with risks at both low and high levels [66], the recent meta-analysis did not find any association with high VD levels and negative health outcomes [67].",1
The supplementation should be continued during the breast feeding period even in larger doses of 6000IU daily in order to avoid deficiency in neonates [68].,1
"During the preparation for pregnancy in VD-deficient females (with serum VD 50–125nmol/L), it is advised to supplement vitamin D prior to the first visit in a fertility clinic.",1
"This simple, inexpensive and safe treatment may prevent the need to use more invasive therapy.",1
To consistently raise the blood level of 25(OH)D above 75 nmol/L at least 1500–2000 IU/day VD is required [69].,1
"The doses for adults and elderly people of proper body weight, and pregnant and lactating women should not exceed 4000 IU daily, and the supplementation dosage recommended for pregnant women in winter and less sunny countries is 1500–4000 IU per day (37.5–50.0 μg/day) [10,66,70].",1
"Conclusions\nCurrent research on the role of vitamin D in fertility impairments, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, uterine fibroids, improper semen parameters and in the case of in vitro treatments and pregnancy failure, suggests it plays an important role in human reproduction processes.",1
Vitamin D supplementation is advised in infertility therapy in both partners.,1
"Couples with serum concentration exceeding 50 nmol/L have a higher chance of conception, but this does not regard all patients, where especially males should be supplemented with vitamin D from the beginning of the therapy.",1
"Administration of vitamin D is recommended in the case of considerable deficiency, particularly in obese, insulin resistant women with low AMH levels, as well as in men with oligo- and asthenozoospermia.",1
"Vitamin D is definitely not a Trojan Horse in reproductive health since there were no adverse effects reported for vitamin D intake of up to 10,000 IU/d [66], but to proclaim it the Golden Fleece, more evidence is still required.",1
Evaluating Provider Advice and Women’s Beliefs on Total Weight Gain During Pregnancy\n\nAbstract\nExcessive gestational weight gain (GWG) is associated with complications for both mother and child.,1
"Minority women are at increased risk for excessive GWG, yet are underrepresented in published weight control interventions.",1
"To inform future interventions, we examined the prevalence and accuracy of provider advice and its association with personal beliefs about necessary maternal weight gain among predominantly Latina pregnant women.",1
Only 23.6\xa0% of women reported being told how much weight to gain during pregnancy; although 58.6\xa0% received advice that met Institute of Medicine recommendations.,1
"Findings suggest the need for prenatal providers of low-income, minority women to engage patients in shaping healthy weight gain targets as a precursor to preventing excessive GWG and its complications.",1
"Introduction\nIn 2009, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) revised its guidelines for appropriate weight gain during pregnancy, taking into account the growing prevalence of obesity in women of childbearing age [1].",1
"(Table\xa01) Over 40\xa0% of pregnant women exceed the IOM recommendations for gestational weight gain (GWG), with overweight and obese women at increased risk [2].",1
"Excessive weight gain during pregnancy is associated with complications in delivery [3], increased postpartum weight retention [4], persistent obesity [4], increased BMI in offspring in childhood, adolescence and adulthood [5], and longer maternal hospital stay after labor and delivery [5].",1
"Caption (TABLE-WRAP): TABLE\xa01\n\nClinical recommendations for cumulative gestational weight gain by pre-pregnancy BMI for mothers of singletons and twins at gestational ages 37–42\xa0weeks (IOM, 2009 )Prepregnancy BMIRecommended range ofCumulative weight gain (lbs)SingletonTwinsUnderweight (<18.5\xa0kg/m2)28–40–Normal (18.5–24.9\xa0kg/m2)25–3537–54Overweight (25.0–29.9\xa0kg/m2)15–2531–50Obese (≥30.0\xa0kg/m2)11–2024–42\nActual weight gain during pregnancy is strongly influenced by provider recommendation [6,7].",1
"Evidence shows that women’s actual weight gain during pregnancy is strongly influenced by personal beliefs and healthcare providers’ advice [6,7].",1
"When women receive weight gain advice that is inconsistent with IOM recommendations (i.e., above or below), they are 3.6 times more likely to gain more or less than IOM recommendations, respectively [7].",1
"Women whose personal weight gain targets are below IOM recommendations are five times more likely to gain less than recommended, and women with targets above the recommendations are six times more likely to gain more than recommended [7].",1
There is limited data about the beliefs of Latinas on GWG even though the problem of excessive weight gain during pregnancy is particularly important for this group which now comprises 20\xa0% of new mothers in the US [1].,1
This increased rate of overweight and obesity puts Latinas at increased risk for excessive GWG.,1
The purpose of this paper is to examine the prevalence and accuracy of provider advice on maternal weight gain and its association with personal beliefs about necessary maternal weight gain within a sample of predominantly Latina pregnant women who received prenatal care in their dominant language.,1

This vulnerable population is already at increased risk of excessive GWG and the concomitant adverse effects on mother and child.,1
Provider advice is key in helping women meet appropriate GWG targets [6].,1
"While less than a quarter of women in our study reported receiving any information on weight gain, those who did were more likely to have target weights within clinical recommendations.",1
"Yet similar to other reports in predominantly white women [6], we found that pre-pregnancy BMI is strongly associated with Latina women’s target weight gain.",1
"Together, these findings suggest that providers are as comfortable discussing weight gain restrictions with overweight and obese women as they are with normal weight women, but that overweight and obese women still have weight gain targets in excess of clinical guidelines.",1
Providers may need to re-emphasize their recommendations with overweight and obese patients to help align their personal weight gain targets with current clinical recommendations.,1
Both the lack of receipt of clinical guidance and the recollection of inaccurate information observed in this study are of concern because receipt of provider advice has been shown in prior work to be the most important predictor of a woman’s weight gain target [6].,1
Women who have a weight gain target that is concordant with IOM recommendation are less likely to have excessive weight gain [4].,1
"In our study, normal weight mothers were more likely to have low weight gain targets, whereas overweight and obese women were more likely to have high weight gain targets.",1
This is of concern because excessive weight gain is associated with postpartum weight retention and persistent maternal obesity [4].,1
Other work has shown that generational acculturation was positively associated with excessive GWG [10].,1
"While low maternal education has been associated with higher rates of excessive weight gain [2], our study did not find any significant effect of maternal education on weight gain target.",1
Understanding beliefs about appropriate weight gain during pregnancy is crucial for intervention planning.,1
The strength of this study is its focus on minority women who are underrepresented in published GWG interventions yet carry increased burden of gaining excessively during pregnancy.,1
"However, those who did receive advice were more likely to have personal weight gain targets in line with current clinical recommendations.",1
"These data suggest that prenatal care providers of low-income, minority women in particular should make healthy maternal weight gain targets a priority in their care to prevent excessive weight gain during pregnancy and the associated complications.",1
Racial disparities in cord blood vitamin D levels and its association with small-for-gestational-age infants\n\nAbstract\n\nObjective:\nTo examine the relationship of race and maternal characteristics and their association with cord blood vitamin D levels and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) status.,1
"Results:\nBlack race, Medicaid status, mean body mass index at delivery and lack of prenatal vitamin use were associated with vitamin D deficiency.",1
"Conclusion:\nIdentification of risk factors (black race, Medicaid status, obesity and lack of prenatal vitamin use) can lead to opportunities for targeted prenatal vitamin supplementation to reduce the risk of neonatal vitamin D deficiency and SGA status.",1
"Introduction\nVitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)) is commonly known for its role in calcium metabolism and bone health, but more recently has gained attention for the significant role it plays in pregnancy and perinatal outcomes.",1
"Thus, levels of neonates at birth depend entirely on that of the mother and, accordingly, several studies have consistently correlated cord blood 25(OH)D levels to those of their mothers.1,2,3,4,5,6In addition, maternal vitamin D deficiency has been linked to decreased fetal growth and birth size in observational studies.7,8,9\nMaternal vitamin D deficiency is prevalent, the extent of which can be influenced by many variables including skin pigmentation, sun exposure, season, age, vitamin supplementation and obesity.",1
"Several large observational studies and meta-analyses have described the association of maternal vitamin D deficiency with pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes and premature birth.10,11,12,13Racial disparities in maternal and neonatal vitamin D deficiency have been described.1,14,15Vitamin D deficiency is more common and more severe in black mothers.10,15,16,17,18,19Racial disparities are also seen with pregnancy complications such as preterm birth, pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes, as well as adverse neonatal outcomes including low birth weight and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) status.15,17,20,21However, the majority of studies examined maternal vitamin D levels during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy7,8,22,23and correlated these levels to neonatal outcomes.",1
"Far fewer studies have examined the relationship between cord blood vitamin D levels, which may more accurately reflect fetal levels of vitamin D, and neonatal outcomes.14,24Given the racial disparities seen in both vitamin D deficiency and perinatal outcomes, vitamin D has been proposed as part of the explanation for this disparity, particularly with regard to fetal growth and SGA.8\nIncreased awareness of the growing prevalence of maternal vitamin D deficiency has led to an urgent need for consideration of supplementation during pregnancy.",1
"Although studies have shown that supplementation increases maternal and cord blood vitamin D levels, changes in clinical outcomes have not yet been well proven.",1
"Thus, sufficient evidence is lacking at this time to recommend routine vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy.12However, identification of specific risk factors for vitamin D deficiency and the additive effects of these risk factors may lead to opportunities for targeted supplementation with improved outcomes.",1
"Thus, the primary purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between race, maternal characteristics, cord blood vitamin D levels and SGA status among infants during one winter season in a Midwestern US population.",1
"In particular, we wanted to evaluate the additive effects of race and maternal characteristics such as obesity on vitamin D deficiency and SGA.",1
Our goal was to identify specific high-risk subsets of pregnant women who may benefit from vitamin D supplementation in order to mitigate adverse perinatal outcomes such as SGA.,1
SGA was defined as weight <10% for gestational age according to the Fenton growth chart25and the WHO growth chart (for infants of ⩾37 weeks).26All information was deidentified and entered into a REDCap database.27\n\nCord blood sample analysis\nCord blood samples were spun and the serum was frozen at −80\u2009°C.,1
"To explore relationships between race, vitamin D levels and SGA, we first evaluated race as a predictor of vitamin D levels (sufficient or deficient) in cord blood and assessed for potential confounders: Medicaid status, BMI at delivery, hypertension, maternal age and prenatal vitamin use.",1
"These results informed the next stage of analyses that examined race and vitamin D levels with the outcome of SGA by assessing potential confounders: race, smoking, pre-eclampsia, maternal age, Medicaid status and BMI at delivery.",1
"Differences in the distributions of cord blood 25(OH)D concentrations by race were evident (Figure 1), with a higher proportion of vitamin D-deficient samples found in the black population.",1
"Race, Medicaid status, higher BMI at delivery and lack of prenatal vitamin use were all associated with vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D <50\u2009nmol\u2009l−1; P<0.01).",1
"Similarly, infants on Medicaid, a marker of socioeconomic status, had higher odds of vitamin D deficiency (odds ratio (OR) 2.3, 95% CI: 1.4, 3.8), whereas prenatal vitamin use showed a protective effect (OR 0.24, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.62).",1
"For instance, at a mean maternal BMI of 32.3\u2009kg\u2009m−2, an infant who is black, on Medicaid and no prenatal vitamin use has an 86% (95% CI: 82, 97) probability of vitamin D deficiency, whereas a black infant who is not on Medicaid and with prenatal vitamin use has a 66% (95% CI: 44, 67) probability of vitamin D deficiency.",1
"As vitamin D levels also differed by race, we stratified the models predicting SGA by race and examined vitamin D deficiency, smoking, pre-eclampsia, maternal age, Medicaid status and BMI at delivery as covariates (Table 3).",1
"Black infants with vitamin D deficiency had 2.4 greater odds of SGA (95% CI: 1.0, 5.8) after adjusting for maternal history of PIH and maternal BMI, two significant confounding variables in our model (Table 3).",1
"Similarly, infants of black mothers with history of PIH were associated with 2.3 greater odds of SGA after adjustment for confounding variables.",1
"We examined several additional models with various cutpoints for 25(OH)D based on clinical guidelines and previous literature, while adjusting for maternal PIH and maternal BMI at delivery.",1
"These results indicated that black neonates with 25(OH)D levels <25\u2009nmol\u2009l−1had an even greater odds of being SGA (OR 3.8, 95% CI: 1.4, 10.6) compared with those with levels ⩾50\u2009nmol\u2009l−1.",1
The small proportion of neonates who were SGA with 25(OH)D levels >75\u2009nmol\u2009l−1precluded evaluation at higher cutpoints.,1
"Although SGA status was the main outcome of our study, we also evaluated models of 25(OH)D and birth weight percentile after adjusting for maternal PIH and maternal BMI at delivery.",1
"Discussion\nIn our study population, we found that compared with white infants, black infants had significantly lower cord blood vitamin D levels and a greater proportion of vitamin D deficiency.",1
"Although the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in black mothers and neonates is well known, debate exists as to the relationship between race, vitamin D deficiency and SGA.12,14,15,17,18We examined this relationship in conjunction with additional maternal characteristics in order to identify groups of pregnant women who could benefit most from vitamin D supplementation.",1
"We found that black race was associated with a significantly greater incidence of SGA, and that black race and vitamin D deficiency together were associated with even greater odds of SGA.",1
"Based on our analysis, a minimum threshold cord blood 25(OH)D level of 50\u2009nmol\u2009l−1was protective against SGA status among black infants.",1
"Interestingly however, white race with vitamin D deficiency was not significantly associated with increased odds of SGA.",1
"Only a small proportion of white infants were SGA, and this may have limited our ability to detect significant associations between vitamin D and SGA among white infants.",1
"Vitamin D may affect fetal growth through its effect on calcium metabolism, bone growth and placental development.32Although initial studies showed conflicting results, more recent studies suggest that vitamin D deficiency may adversely affect growth and lead to low birth weight or SGA infants.7,9,11,12,18,22,23,33Because of a known relationship between race and vitamin D status, attention then turned to investigation of the relationship between race, vitamin D deficiency and SGA.",1
"Bodnar et al.8conducted a case–control study to examine the association between vitamin D levels, race and SGA.",1
"[""For white mothers, measurement of maternal serum 25(OH)D at <22 weeks' gestation showed a U-shaped relationship between vitamin D status and risk of SGA, where the highest risk for SGA was seen with both low and high vitamin D levels.""]",1
"However, no relationship was seen between vitamin D status and SGA among black mothers.",1
"In a larger study, Burris et al.14examined the relationship between second-trimester serum 25(OH)D levels and SGA in blacks and whites and found a higher risk of SGA in both vitamin D-deficient black and white infants.",1
Gernand et al.22also examined second-trimester vitamin D levels and risk of SGA in a population at risk of pre-eclampsia.,1
"They found that vitamin D status was associated with risk of SGA in white and nonobese women, but that there was no association between vitamin D and SGA in black or obese mothers.",1
"In contrast to the above-mentioned studies, our results show that the combination of black race and vitamin D deficiency was associated with increased odds of SGA, but this relationship was not preserved for white infants.",1
Our results may have differed for several reasons.,1
"First, the majority of populations in the studies of Bodnar et al.8and Burris et al.14were white, whereas the majority of our study population was black.",1
"Furthermore, this study was conducted in Hamilton County, Ohio, an area with worse perinatal outcomes than national averages, including higher infant mortality, preterm birth and low birth weight rates, as well as considerable racial disparities in infant mortality and perinatal outcomes.34All of cord blood samples were collected over one winter season, thus negating seasonal variations in vitamin D levels that may have been seen in other studies.",1
"Finally, we analyzed cord blood vitamin D levels at the time of delivery, rather than maternal serum vitamin D levels during pregnancy.",1
"Although cord blood 25(OH)D levels do correlate to maternal levels, factors that affect fetal growth may not be uniform throughout pregnancy and this difference in timing could affect study findings.1,3,4,5,6In addition, maternal characteristics such as obesity or pre-eclampsia could also affect results that may not have been seen if vitamin D samples were obtained during early pregnancy.",1
"Concurrently, we also examined maternal variables known to potentially affect vitamin D levels and SGA in an effort to better understand the role of these risk factors in vitamin D levels and risk of SGA.",1
"Our results showed several factors to be significant, including BMI at delivery, pre-eclampsia, Medicaid status (as a measure of socioeconomic status) and prenatal vitamin use.",1
"Obesity is well known to be a risk factor for vitamin D deficiency because of a sequestering of vitamin D in adipose tissue.35Maternal obesity during pregnancy has also been associated with lower vitamin D levels in neonates at delivery.24,36,37,38Our data are consistent and illustrate the inverse relationship between maternal BMI at delivery and vitamin D status after adjusting for confounding variables.",1
"The increased odds of vitamin D deficiency in neonates relative to maternal BMI level were seen in both blacks and whites in our study population and supports similar findings seen in a study done by Bodnar et al.38Although prenatal vitamin use was not significantly different between blacks and whites in our study, prenatal vitamin use was significant among those with and without vitamin D deficiency.",1
"Furthermore, the protective effect against vitamin D deficiency was seen in both blacks and whites in our study, in contrast to a recently published study by Burris et al.",1
",39who found that lack of prenatal vitamin use was associated with vitamin D deficiency in white but not black women.",1
"Importantly, our study illustrates the additive effect of maternal risk factors and their predictive probabilities for vitamin D deficiency and SGA.",1
Black mothers on Medicaid who were obese and did not take prenatal vitamins had the highest probability of having an infant with vitamin D deficiency.,1
Pre-eclampsia is a known independent risk factor for SGA.,1
"Pre-eclampsia, coupled with black race and vitamin D deficiency, resulted in significant increases in the predicted probability of delivering an SGA infant.",1
"Interestingly, our results show that increasing maternal BMI had a mild protective effect on risk of SGA.",1
"This corresponds to the well-known association that women with higher BMI tend to deliver infants with higher birth weights.40,41,42\nFurthermore, identification and recognition of women and infants at high risk of vitamin D deficiency and SGA can lead to opportunities for risk modification and reduction in adverse outcomes.",1
"Specifically, this study supports a need to target supplementation strategies to mitigate the impact of adverse perinatal outcomes such as SGA.",1
"Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy has been shown to positively affect cord blood vitamin D levels at birth.43,44Studies of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy thus far have shown conflicting results with respect to birth weight and reduction of SGA.43,45,46,47,48Adequately powered and randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy are needed to assess the impact of supplementation on SGA as well as the appropriate dose and timing of supplementation.",1
"In addition, individuals with the risk factors that we have identified may benefit even more from supplementation or higher dose supplementation.",1
"If vitamin D supplementation does not occur during pregnancy, it may be imperative to identify and offer additional supplementation beyond the routinely recommended 400\u2009IU per day for all infants.28\nThere were several limitations to our study.",1
"First, we did not have information regarding exact amounts of dietary maternal vitamin D intake and sun exposure that may affect maternal and cord blood vitamin D levels.",1
We collected samples over one winter season to mitigate the effect of varying sun exposure.,1
Corresponding maternal vitamin D status at different gestations during pregnancy was unknown.,1
This would have allowed for a more expansive definition of the relationship between maternal vitamin D status and perinatal outcomes.,1
"Finally, as a retrospective study, we were limited by available data and the amount of cord blood available for further testing.",1
Conclusion\nBlack obese mothers on Medicaid without prenatal vitamin use were at the highest risk of delivering neonates with vitamin D deficiency.,1
"Furthermore, black race and vitamin D deficiency were associated with an increased risk of SGA.",1
We identified additive and modifiable maternal risk factors that would benefit most from risk reduction and targeted vitamin D supplementation.,1
A greater understanding of the variables that influence vitamin D status during pregnancy can have an immense public health impact in the reduction of adverse perinatal outcomes such as SGA.,1
Low cord-serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with poor lung function performance and increased respiratory infection in infancy\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nPerinatal vitamin D deficiency is associated with a higher risk of wheezing in childhood.,1
"However, the relationship between vitamin D levels and lung function in infancy has not been investigated.",1
The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of perinatal vitamin D levels on respiratory function and disease outcome in infancy.,1
"25(OH)D levels in maternal and cord serum were highly correlated ( r2= 0.457, p< 0.0001).",1
Infants with lower cord serum 25(OH)D levels (< 13.7 ng/ml) had higher resistance of respiratory system ( p< 0.01) and a higher risk of a respiratory tract infection before the age of 6 months ( p< 0.01).,1
"Conclusion\nAlthough a high correlation was found between maternal and cord vitamin D levels, the effect on respiratory outcome was different.",1
Our study is the first to show that low cord 25(OH)D levels significantly relationship with poorer lung function performance and higher likelihood of a respiratory tract infection before 6 months of age.,1
Introduction\nVitamin D is crucial not only for calcium metabolism and skeletal health but also in the homeostasis of many other systems.,1
"Since the discovery that most tissues and cells have vitamin D receptors, there has been great interest in its role in the development of many diseases, such as cancer [1], cardiovascular diseases [2], infectious diseases [3], and autoimmune disease [4].",1
reported an inverse correlation between prenatal vitamin D intake and recurrent wheezing of offspring [5].,1
Measurements of vitamin D serum level 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] have yielded conflicting results regarding the relationship between maternal- or cord-blood levels and subsequent asthma development [6–15].,1
"However, Baiz et al.",1
"have recently shown that infants with low cord serum vitamin D levels have a higher risk of childhood wheezing [7,11].",1
"Although episodes of wheezing during childhood are mostly caused by a viral respiratory infection, their detailed pathogenesis and relationship with asthma are unclear.",1
"classified childhood wheezing into four distinct phenotypes: no wheezing, transient early wheezing, late-onset wheezing, and persistent wheezing [16].",1
"In the study, the majority of infants with transient early wheezing had diminished airway function in early life.",1
A recent study further revealed that cord serum 25(OH)D levels were inversely correlated with the risk of transient early wheezing [11].,1
"However, the relationship between vitamin D levels and respiratory function during infancy has not yet been clarified.",1
The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of perinatal vitamin D levels on the performance of respiratory function in infancy.,1
"The secondary objective was to further clarify the effect on the risk of eczema, wheezing, and respiratory tract infections in early life.",1
"Neonates born prematurely (gestational age < 37 weeks), those with major birth defects or congenital structural anomalies of the upper airway, those who were hemodynamically unstable, and those with a history of severe lower airway infection with intensive care admission, were excluded from the study.",1
"Since there were few adverse events being reported, chloral hydrate has been the preferred medication for infant lung function tests for over 20 years at US and Europe [21].",1
"Infant lung function testing was performed with the Jaeger Masterscreen BabyBody Paediatrics System (CareFusion, Höchberg, Germany), which conforms with the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society recommendations [22–25].",1
"There was a significant positive correlation between maternal and cord serum 25(OH)D levels ( r2= 0.457, p< 0.0001;Fig 2).",1
"The mean 25(OH)D level of the 71 infants who successfully underwent later infant lung function testing was 13.8 ± 6.3 ng/ml, and that of their mothers was 15.0 ± 6.1 ng/ml, which were also significantly correlated ( r2= 0.468, p< 0.0001).10.1371/journal.pone.0173268.g002\n\nCaption (FIG): FIG 2\nCorrelation between maternal and cord serum 25(OH)D levels.",1
"Lung function and outcome vs 25(OH)D levels\nTo compare the effect of cord 25(OH)D level on lung function at 6 months of age, we defined those with cord 25(OH)D level ≥ 13.8 ng/ml as the “high cord 25(OH)D” group, and the rest as the “low cord 25(OH)D” group.",1
"In addition, maternal 25D(OH) level ≥15.0 ng/ml was described as “high maternal 25(OH)D” and <15.0 ng/ml as “low maternal 25(OH)D.”\nA significant difference in the Rrs was found between the high and low cord 25(OH)D groups (3.8 ± 0.8 vs. 4.4 ± 1.0 kPa*s/L, p< 0.01).",1
"After adjusting for body length and comparing with a local reference, the high cord 25(OH)D group still had significantly lower Rrs than did the low cord 25(OH)D group (Table 1).",1
"However, no differences were noted in the various parameters of lung function between high and low maternal 25(OH)D groups (Table 2).",1
"Although the incidence of infant wheeze was similar between the groups, the percentage of respiratory tract infection was significantly higher in infants with a low cord serum 25(OH)D level (Table 1).",1
"The analysis showed that high cord 25(OH)D was the strongest predictor of good lung function performance (Table 3), and vice versa, low cord level predicted poor lung function outcome.",1
"Meanwhile, paternal history with allergic rhinitis and maternal smoke in pregnancy also had adverse effect on lung function.",1
"However, low cord 25(OH)D alone was the only predicted higher probability of respiratory infection in the first 6 months of life (Table 4).10.1371/journal.pone.0173268.t003\n\nCaption (TABLE-WRAP): TABLE 3\nMultiple linear regression analysis of lung function outcome (Z score of Rrs).Beta (s.e.",1
Discussion\nA positive correlation was found between 25(OH)D levels in the serum of mother and child in this prospective birth cohort study.,1
This is the first report to show that low cord—and not maternal—serum 25(OH)D levels contribute to relatively poor lung performance at 6 months of age.,1
An increased risk for a respiratory tract infection before the age of 6 months was also found in infants with low cord 25(OH)D level.,1
"However, no differences were found in the incidence of wheeze and eczema or the rate of nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization between the groups with high and low 25(OH)D levels of mother—cord serum pairs.",1
"Infants who were exclusively breastfed or had high levels of skin pigmentation, inadequate sunlight exposure, or inadequate vitamin supplement are at risk of a vitamin D deficiency [26].",1
"Although a circulating level of 25(OH)D less than 20 ng/mL is defined as vitamin D deficiency [27,28], the mean levels may vary among different populations [29].",1
"In previous studies, mean 25(OH)D levels were generally higher than 20 ng/ml in maternal serum [6,8,9].",1
"However, cord serum levels ranged widely from 10.95 to 34.4 ng/mL [7,11–13,30].",1
"In this study, the mean 25(OH)D level in the cord serum (13.8 ng/mL) was comparable with other reports, but a lower mean level in the maternal serum (15.0 ng/mL) was observed.",1
These suboptimal levels were also seen in recent reports by Liao et al [31].,1
"Nevertheless, fair correlations between mother and cord blood were found in previous and this study as well [9].",1
"Animal studies have found that vitamin D deficiency can cause deficits in lung function, which can be explained by a change in lung development [32].",1
"Similarly, in a large birth cohort study, infants with low cord serum 25(OH)D had a higher risk of transient wheeze before the age of 5 years [11].",1
The COPSAC2000study have failed to show an association between cord 25(OH)D level and lung function at 7 years of age [33].,1
Also no association was also found between a children’s vitamin D levels and their lung function at 6–7 years of age in the KOALA birth cohort study [34].,1
"However, in contrary to these reports, a survey in Canadian children showed that both low and high vitamin D levels were related to increased risk of wheeze and reduced performance of lung function [35].",1
"However, comparing to our study, the median level of cord 25(OH)D of COPSAC2000was relatively high (19 ng/ml).",1
"Furthermore, instead of measuring cord serum 25(OH)D, both KOALA and Canadian studies determined the level of 25(OH)D during preschool or school age.",1
"Regarding to the relationship between 25(OH)D and lung function in adults, the HUNT study revealed that low serum 25(OH)D level was not associated with airway obstruction in most asthma adults with the exception of males with asthma but without allergic rhinitis [36].",1
"Therefore, drawing conclusions about the effects of perinatal and postnatal vitamin D status from these results can be difficult.",1
"In this study, although cord serum 25(OH)D level was not associated with higher risk of wheeze at 6 months, it is related with increased respiratory resistance.",1
"Furthermore, it is worth noticing that the increased airway resistance may result in a higher risk of wheezing in early childhood.",1
Infant lung function testing has been widely used in research and clinical practices.,1
Measurements of resistance and forced expiration are the most commonly used maneuvers to assess airway function.,1
"By comparison, forced expiration maneuvers more closely reflect the function of the intrathoracic airway.",1
"In this study, infants with low 25(OH)D had higher Rrs but similar VmaxFRC, which implies that low perinatal vitamin D levels might be associated with a higher resistance of the extrathoracic airway.",1
The fetal vitamin D status is dependent on the placental-fetal circulation.,1
"Though, the interpretation of serum 25(OH)D level may be complicated by the presence of C3-epimer of 25(OH)D [C3-epi-25(OH)D], a vitamin metabolite that may be erroneously included as 25(OH)D by LC-MS and immunoassay methods [43].",1
"Bailey et al had discovered that, after transplacental circulation, the concentration of C3-epi-25(OH)D was significant higher in infants than mother [44].",1
"Therefore, the high concentration of C3-epi-25(OH)D in infants may explain that low cord—but not maternal—serum 25(OH)D levels contribute to poor lung function and increased risk of respiratory infection in this study.",1
Recent studies have shown that vitamin D can directly stimulate several immune cells and can promote the production of antimicrobial peptides [45–47].,1
"In asthmatic children, episodes of acute exacerbation relating to respiratory infection were also inversely associated with serum 25(OH)D levels [49].",1
"In a randomized control trial, a vitamin D supplement can even decrease the risk of seasonal flu in children [50].",1
"Because of substantial antibody levels from transplacental transmission, infants are less likely to get respiratory infection before 6 months of age.",1
has shown that infants with low cord serum 25(OH)D levels have a higher risk of respiratory tract infection before the age of 3 months [7].,1
"However, the exact association between single cord-serum vitamin D level and postnatal immunity is unclear.",1
More investigation is required to further understand the role of vitamin D for the prevention of respiratory tract infection in infancy.,1
There are some potential limitations to our findings.,1
"First, in cause of the difficulties in performing infant lung function testing, relatively small number of mother-infant pairs was enrolled in this study.",1
"In post hoc analysis of two-tail t test, the statistical power could reach 0.6 (alpha risk, 0.05; effect size, 0.5).",1
"In addition, in the regression model for analysis of predictors, the power still can achieve as high as 0.8 (alpha risk, 0.05; effect size f2, 0.15).",1
"Second, our previous report concluded that relatively low vitamin D levels were common in the PATCH population sample of children and young adults with an inverse correlation between 25(OH)D level and age being shown here [51].",1
"The majority of the participants lived in Keelung, a rainy city whose inhabitants have a higher risk of vitamin D deficiency than elsewhere due to lack of sun exposure [52].",1
"In our study, the mean 25(OH)D level of the maternal serum was low, at 15 ng/ml, which might hinder our investigation.",1
"Third, a large percentage of infants in the low cord 25(OH)D group were male, although our previous study found no gender difference in the infant lung function test [18].",1
"Furthermore, the measurement of respiratory mechanics relies on both the absence of airflow and the invocation of the Hering—Breuer reflex while occluding the air outflow [53].",1
"Although this technique is relatively noninvasive and easy to perform, there is limited evidence showing that the Rrs is sensitive enough to distinguish between different groups of infants with various clinical conditions [54].",1
"Therefore, defining the causal relationship between Rrs and clinical outcomes in infants with low cord serum 25(OH)D levels is difficult.",1
"Last, the sample size was rather small, and the vitamin D levels of the participants were generally suboptimal in our study.",1
"Although poor lung function performance and an increased risk of respiratory tract infection were related to relatively low cord serum vitamin D levels, further extrapolating the effects of vitamin D on the respiratory function of the general infant population might still be difficult.",1
"In conclusion, this study is the first to reveal that infants with low cord serum 25(OH)D levels have poorer lung function at 6 months of age compared with those with high levels.",1
They also have a higher risk of a respiratory tract infection before this age.,1
"Although cord vitamin D levels are strongly correlated with maternal vitamin D levels, the extent of the impact on later respiratory function is distinctive.",1
We believe that this study provides a clearer understanding of the effect of perinatal vitamin D levels on respiratory function and respiratory outcome in infancy.,1
Association of influenza vaccination during pregnancy with birth outcomes in Nicaragua\n\nAbstract\nBackground: Studies have shown that influenza vaccination during pregnancy reduces the risk of influenza disease in pregnant women and their offspring.,1
Some have proposed that maternal vaccination may also have beneficial effects on birth outcomes.,1
"In 2014, we conducted an observational study to test this hypothesis using data from two large hospitals in Managua, Nicaragua.",1
Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate associations between influenza vaccination and birth outcomes.,1
We assessed self-reports of influenza vaccination status by further reviewing medical records of those who self-reported but did not have readily available evidence of vaccination status.,1
"With PSM, after adjusting for risk factors, we observed protective associations between influenza vaccination in the second and third trimester and preterm birth (aOR: 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.75–0.99 and aOR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.45–0.96, respectively) and between influenza vaccination in the second trimester and low birth weight (aOR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.64–0.97).",1
Conclusions: We found evidence to support an association between influenza vaccination and birth outcomes by trimester of receipt with data from an urban population in Nicaragua.,1
The study had significant selection and recall biases.,1
Prospective studies are needed to minimize these biases.,1
"Introduction\nInfection with influenza during pregnancy and its association with adverse birth outcomes has been documented since the early 1900s[1],[2].",1
"For instance, infection with influenza virus during pregnancy may prompt an inflammatory [cascade] response that is associated with preterm birth[3],[4].",1
"Influenza vaccination has been shown to reduce the risk of influenza virus disease and its complications among pregnant women and their infants[5],[6],[7],[8],[9],[10],[11],[12],[13],[14],[15].",1
"Furthermore, some studies have found a beneficial effect of influenza vaccination on birth outcomes, specifically a decreased likelihood of delivering a baby preterm or small for gestational age[16],[17],[18],[19],[20],[21],[22].",1
"Other studies, however, have found no evidence to support this hypothesis[23],[24],[25],[26],[27],[28],[29],[30].",1
"Published studies have differed substantially from one another in design and in ability to account for variations in circulating influenza viruses, vaccine components, target population, and place of study, making cross-study comparisons difficult[31].",1
Historic influenza surveillance data from Nicaragua shows that influenza circulates between June and November[32].,1
"Since 2007, the Nicaraguan Government has provided influenza vaccination to women with high-risk pregnancies in the month of May, following the vaccination schedule for countries with southern hemisphere circulation of influenza viruses[33],[34].",1
"With the aim of evaluating the hypothesis that influenza vaccination has a beneficial effect on birth outcomes, we collected birth outcome data, current influenza vaccination status, and risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes by interviewing post-partum women at two large hospitals in Managua.",1
"Methods\n\nSurvey\n\nSample size calculation\nSample size planning was informed by calculating sample needs in order to detect a 40% reduction of low birth weight among newborns of vaccinated (regardless of vaccination trimester) compared to unvaccinated mothers[20],[21], assuming a two-sided 95% confidence level, 80% power, and a ratio of unvaccinated to vaccinated of 2:5[33].",1
A design effect of 1.5 was considered to account for any potential biases.,1
The sample size required was estimated to be 2769 (1938 vaccinated and 831 unvaccinated pregnant women).,1
"Influenza vaccination was self-reported; however, interviewers validated this information using vaccination cards and/or antenatal medical records if available.",1
"Sample size of the random sample, per group, was calculated using the formula to estimate a proportion assuming that 90% of those who self-reported being vaccinated or unvaccinated status were truly vaccinated or unvaccinated, respectively[37].",1
"Due to the low PPV and high NPV, we excluded from further analyses women who self-reported vaccination status but did not present evidence of vaccination, and we included all participants who self-reported non-vaccination status.",1
A proxy variable was calculated for cumulative influenza exposure using influenza surveillance data from Nicaragua[38].,1
"Birth outcome data were defined and calculated as follows: (1) gestational age at delivery was calculated using LMP, if available, or gestational age at any ultrasound obtained from antenatal medical records (seeSupplementary material A1for gestational age calculation algorithm); (2) small for gestational age (SGA) was calculated from weight and gestational age at delivery according to the International Fetal and Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21st Century, or intergrowth-21st standards[36]; (3) preterm birth (PTB) was defined as born with <37\xa0weeks of gestational age; and (4) low birth weight (LBW) was defined as born weighing <2500\xa0g.\n\nStatistical analysis\nWe compared all variables by vaccination status using chi-square test to compare differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated women regardless of trimester of receipt of influenza vaccination.",1
"When the requirement was not met, we randomly sampled from the vaccinated cases to obtain an unvaccinated to vaccinated ratio greater than one.",1
"As a secondary investigation, we assessed the association of influenza vaccination and birth outcomes by trimester in which women received influenza vaccination; the unvaccinated group was used as a control for all models.",1
"Ninety-seven percent (3172) reported having at least one antenatal visit during pregnancy, 78% (2549) reported four or more antenatal visits, and 91% (2984) reported having at least one dose of tetanus vaccine; all of these antenatal care indicators were significantly more common among vaccinated compared to unvaccinated women.",1
"More than half of the surveyed women (57%) reported having at least one chronic condition (obesity, diabetes, asthma, renal disease, liver disease, blood disease, neurologic disease); conditions were more common among vaccinated (60%) than unvaccinated women (53%) (p-value\xa0<\xa00.01).",1
"However, only among participants vaccinated in the first trimester, the percentage with preterm birth was 12%, significantly higher than the unvaccinated group (6%; p-value\xa0<\xa00.05;Supplementary material A2).",1
"In both models, we observed a trend whereby the later in pregnancy a women received vaccination the lower her adjusted odds of PTB.",1
"However, the protective effect of influenza vaccination on PTB among those receiving vaccination in their second and third trimester was significant with PSM (aOR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.75–0.99 and aOR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.45–0.96, respectively;Table 4).",1
"In addition, we found a protective effect of influenza vaccination on LBW among those vaccinated in the second trimester (aOR: 0.80; 95%CI: 0.64–0.97) using PSM.",1
Further analyses including those who self-reported vaccination showed similar trends (seeSupplementary materials A3-A5).,1
Discussion\nThe present study did not find an association between maternal influenza vaccination administered at any point in pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes among their babies.,1
"However, in secondary analyses stratifying influenza vaccination by trimester we observed a protective effect of vaccination on PTB in the second and third trimester and on LBW in the second trimester.",1
"Although there is a possibility that vaccination can explain these protective effects, observational studies have inherent biases that preclude them from establishing causality[41],[42].",1
"Using PSM, we observed a protective effect of influenza vaccination on PTB and LBW among those vaccinated in the second and third trimester.",1
"Although not statistically significant, the MLR approach also trended in the same direction.",1
"Likely, the analysis with PSM corrected for biases related to the probability of influenza vaccination by controlling for differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated women that we were not able to control for in MLR[43].",1
"Our findings are consistent with a number of studies that found an association between receiving influenza vaccination and reduced likelihood of delivering a baby PTB or with LBW[16],[17],[18],[19],[20],[21],[22].",1
"In addition, a recent meta-analysis found a strong association between receipt of influenza vaccination and reduced likelihood of PTB and LBW, and the magnitude of the association that Nunes et al.",1
reported was comparable to our findings[44].,1
"On the other hand, numerous other studies report a lack of association between influenza vaccination and birth outcomes[23],[24],[25],[26],[27],[28],[29],[30].",1
Two of these studies used similar methods to our study.,1
"analyzed the large Vaccine Safety Datalink dataset (n\xa0=\xa057,554 pregnant women in the United States) to assess these associations and after using propensity score to minimize bias introduced by the probability of being vaccinated found no association between influenza vaccination during pregnancy and risk of SGA or PTB[26].",1
"also did not find an association when analyzing retrospective data by trimester of vaccination and applying propensity score to account for the probability of vaccination; however, this study was performed during the 2009 pandemic so may not be directly comparable[29].",1
"Overall, differences in study design, populations, influenza virus and circulation variability make it a challenge to compare results[31].",1
"Observational studies like ours are subject to potential residual confounding, and Vazquez-Benitez et al.",1
[43]demonstrated that not accounting for biases in observational data can mislead the results.,1
"In our study, in addition to social desirability or recall bias on key variables like chronic conditions, there may have been residual confounding as we did not collect information on other risk factors known to be associated with adverse neonatal outcomes, such as previous history of adverse birth outcomes, domestic violence, harsh working conditions, or exposure to pollutants or chemicals[45],[46],[47],[48],[49],[50].",1
"In addition, we lacked specific information regarding the timing of antenatal supplements or health complications during pregnancy, and the literature shows that the timing of these events with respect to trimester of gestation could be associated with birth outcomes[51],[52].",1
We acknowledge the following limitations.,1
"However, little is known about how well the recommendations were implemented.",1
"Indeed, vaccine uptake remained somewhat higher among pregnant women with pre-existing chronic medical conditions in our study year suggesting that the recommendation may have been slow to take effect.",1
Higher vaccination among pregnant women with high-risk pregnancies could have caused a selection bias as those vaccinated women would have been at higher risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes compared to unvaccinated women.,1
"Second, the sample was not randomly selected.",1
"Women who agreed to participate in the study could have been different from women who did not participate in the study, and we did not collect characteristics on women who refused to participate in the study to ascertain this bias.",1
"Third, we did not power the sample size to analyze effects by trimester of vaccination and so may have missed important effects.",1
"Fourth, we based our calculation of gestational age at delivery on LMP which is known to be subject to recall bias and could have introduced errors in our calculations[53].",1
"However, when LMP was determined to be unreliable, we calculated gestational age at delivery using data from an ultrasound.",1
"Approximately 6% of the gestational age estimates came from ultrasounds in the last trimester, which have higher rates of estimate error than estimates calculated in early pregnancy.",1
"Finally, we were not able to obtain information on previous pregnancy outcomes; previous history of PTB or abortion in the second trimester has been associated with an increased frequency of PTB[54].",1
"Despite these limitations, the strengths of our study include having access to birth outcomes from medical records as well as having available influenza surveillance data.",1
"Studies suggest that the effect of influenza vaccination on birth outcomes may be better observed during high influenza circulation period, and there was a substantial influenza circulation in Nicaragua in 2014[20],[21],[55].",1
"Furthermore, the propensity score analyses minimized biases introduced by differences in baseline characteristics between unvaccinated and vaccinated pregnant women by accounting for the probability of vaccination based on these characteristics[43].",1
We were also able to perform sensitivity analysis for self-reported vaccination.,1
"Moreover, we used international standards to define the variable small for gestational age[36]and validated it with a World Health Organization calculator to estimate SGA[56]; results were consistent for both (data not shown).",1
"In summary, we found some evidence of a protective effect of influenza vaccination by trimester on birth outcomes; however, we encourage further investigation by prioritizing prospective cohort designs over retrospective studies to minimize selection and recall biases.",1
"In addition, it may be helpful for countries to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices of influenza vaccination recommendations among health personnel, especially in countries where influenza vaccination recommendations and practices have recently been implemented or expanded.",1
Gestational exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals in relation to infant birth weight: a Bayesian analysis of the HOME Study\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nPregnant women are exposed to a mixture of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs).,1
"Gestational EDC exposures may be associated with changes in fetal growth that elevates the risk for poor health later in life, but few studies have examined the health effects of simultaneous exposure to multiple chemicals.",1
"This study aimed to examine the association of gestational exposure to five chemical classes of potential EDCs: phthalates and bisphenol A, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) with infant birth weight.",1
"Conclusion\nGestational exposure to phthalates, PFAS, PCBs, PBDEs, OCPs or OPPs had null or small associations with birth weight.",1
"Gestational OPP, Pb, and PFAS exposures were most strongly associated with lower birth weight.",1
"The vulnerability of the developing fetus [15] coupled with the pervasive nature of EDCs has raised concerns about reproductive health effects arising from gestational EDC exposure, such as low birth weight [15].",1
"Low birth weight is a predictor for coronary heart disease [16], diabetes mellitus [17] and infant mortality [17].",1
"Additionally, some previously published studies [14,15] found associations between gestational EDC exposure and birth weight.",1
Understanding the role EDCs may play in affecting birth weight will inform efforts to prevent low birth weight and the development of chronic diseases.,1
Many investigators have explored the relationship between EDC exposures and birth weight [18].,1
"examined the relationships between 16 chemicals (6 phthalates, 8 PFAS, 2 PCBs and 1 OCP) and birth weight using Elastic Net Regression analyses; 2 phthalates, 1 PFAS, and 1 OCP were associated with lower birth weight [18].",1
"Using a job exposure matrix, which can differ from exposure measurement, Birks et al.",1
(2016) examined occupational EDC exposures in a meta-analysis of European birth cohorts and found that pregnant women exposed to more than 1 EDC class were more likely to have a low birth weight infant [15].,1
"There is sufficient evidence that increased PFAS (especially PFOA) exposure is associated with low birth weight [18–20], but mixed results are reported for other EDCs and birth weight [18,21].",1
"(2016), found an association between PCB 153 and low birth weight [21] whereas Lenters et al.",1
[18] did not find an association.,1
"Similar inconsistent associations exist for phthalates and BPA [22–24], OCPs [18,25] and PBDEs [26,27].",1
These inconsistencies may be due to a shortage of statistical tools to explore the effects of multiple chemical exposure mixtures on birth weight.,1
One way to model multi-exposure mixtures is to collapse the exposures into a summary term that is included in regression models for the outcome [28] or use proxy variables [29].,1
"These approaches, however, assign equal weight and importance to all chemicals, irrespective of their predictive value.",1
"Multivariable linear regression [5,13,24] with selected predictors [30] is another method, but it can produce unreliable estimates due to the highly correlated nature of some EDCs [31].",1
LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) [30] and Elastic Net are more sophisticated multivariable linear modeling methods that have been used for analyzing multiple correlated exposure variables.,1
Bayesian hierarchical linear models (BHLMs) are one possible solution to analyzing the effect of multiple correlated exposures [32].,1
"The objective of this study was to use BHLM to simultaneously examine the association between exposure to 5 different EDC classes (phthalates and BPA, PFAS, PCBs, PBDEs and OCPs), 2 organophosphate pesticides (OPPs) and 2 heavy metals, lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg), with birth weight among women and their children in the Health Outcomes and Measures of Environment (HOME) Study [34].",1
"Pb, while not conventionally considered an EDC, is a widespread reproductive [38] toxin that impacts neurodevelopment [6] and birth weight at very low exposure levels [39] and so is included in this study.",1

Using 50% CIs gives higher power to detect small effects in the data and they can serve as a screening tool for identifying weak effects that may warrant further study [33].,1
"However, a limitation of 50% CIs when used for multiple frequentist hypothesis tests is that they have a higher Type I error rate than using alpha level = 0.05.",1
"Additionally, to better understand the impact of the BHLM shrinkage on the regression coefficients, we re-analyzed the data using both LASSO and Elastic Net.",1
"Note that confidence intervals for beta coefficients from LASSO and Elastic Net are not available using standard software, and calculating standard errors for parameter estimates is challenging because the shrinkage estimation produces biased estimates for large coefficients.",1
"Several maternal demographic characteristics predicted birth weight, including age, race, marital status, annual household income, public or no insurance and other SES variables.",1
Tobacco smoke exposure also predicted lower birth weight with a 210 g reduction among smoking mothers (>3 ng/ml serum cotinine) compared with non-smoking mothers (<3 ng/ml serum cotinine).,1
"With few exceptions (e.g., PFOA), median concentrations among HOME Study participants tended to be similar to concentrations observed in US women (Table2).",1
"Individual chemicals within a class tended to be positively correlated with each other, particularly for persistent compounds like PCBs and PBDEs (Additional file1: Figure S2 [43]).",1
"Phthalates and BPA were less strongly correlated with other chemicals and, with the exception of the di-2-ethylhexylphthalate metabolites, weakly correlated with each other.",1
"The σβposterior mean was 10 g, which indicated heterogeneity in the phthalate and BPA effects around this estimate, and that roughly two thirds of the beta coefficients were within 10 g (one standard deviation) of μβ.",1
"In contrast, for PFAS exposure, the μβand σβposterior means were larger in magnitude and equal to -11 g, 95% CI (-52, 34) and 24 g, respectively.",1
"Finally, OCP exposure was associated with a μβof 7 g, 95% CI (-25, 99) with an estimated σβof 18 g.\nWe examined associations between individual EDCs and birth weight to understand which individual EDCs within a class drive the value of μβ, given by the posterior distribution of the BHLM regression coefficients βx1... βxp(see Figs.1and2).",1
"In the phthalates and BPA class, there was a 9 g birth weight increase in response to a 10-fold increase exposure to MEOHP, and a 10-fold increase in MEHP exposure was associated with a 7 g decrease in birth weight.",1
"None of the individual phthalate metabolites or BPA were statistically significant at the 0.05 or 0.5 level, which may explain why the class as a whole was not significantly different from zero.",1
"In contrast, all 5 PFAS were associated with reductions in birth weight, although none of the 95% CIs excluded zero.",1
"PFHXS exhibited the largest association in the BHLM with a 10-fold exposure increase associated with a 17 g birth weight decrease, whereas PFNA was the weakest predictor of birth weight.",1
PCBs ranged from an 8 g birth weight increase associated with a 10-fold increase of PCB 105 to a 7 g decrease associated with a 10-fold increase in PCB 199.,1
The large number of 23 PCBs examined in this study meant that the BHLM performed more aggressive shrinkage on the model regression coefficients for this class.,1
"Of the 9 PBDEs, a 10-fold increase in PBDE 17 was associated with the greatest birth weight increase (12 g) while PBDE 153 was associated with the greatest decrease (23 g).",1
"The largest increase in the OCP class was seen with a 10-fold increase in HCH exposure (5 g), while the largest birth weight decrease was seen in response to a 10-fold increase in Nonachlor exposure (10 g).",1
"DMP exposure was associated with a 57 g reduction in birth weight (95% CI (-123, 10), 50% CI (-79, -34)).",1
"Blood lead concentration was associated with a 45 g decrease in birth weight (95% CI (-110, 22), 50% CI (-68, -22)), while mercury exposure was associated with a 5 g, 95%CI (-56, 66) increase in birth weight.",1
"The LASSO regression coefficients tended to be larger in magnitude than BHLM with wider and less precise 95% intervals, which we expected because LASSO does not use shrinkage that borrows information between chemicals within a particular class.",1
Our Elastic Net analysis identified 1 EDC in common with Lenters et al.,1
"In Lenters, this EDC was associated with a -0.15 g difference in birth weight, which was attenuated after adjusting for gestational age.",1
"In our analysis, MEOHP was associated with a 13 g birth weight increase (Additional file1: Figure S3).",1
"Additionally, Pb was associated with a 58 g decrease in birth weight in the LASSO analysis (Additional file1: Figure S3) and a 53 g decrease in the Elastic Net analysis (Additional file1: Figure S4).",1
"DEP, one OPP, was associated with a 16 g birth weight increase using LASSO (Additional file1: Figure S3) and DMP, the other OPP, was associated with a 48 g decrease (Additional file1: Figure S3).",1
"In the Elastic Net analysis, DEP was associated with a 21 g increase and DMP with a 54g decrease in birth weight (Additional file1: Figure S4).",1
"Because LASSO and Elastic Net do not estimate the μβparameter, this makes Additional file1: Figures S2 and S3 harder to interpret because they do not estimate the average association between the exposure variables and the outcome within a chemical class.",1
"GA is a potential mediating variable on the causal pathway between EDC exposure and birth weight, while sex is a potential modifier.",1
Controlling for mediators may attenuate the total effect of EDCs on birth weight.,1
"While the results are mostly unchanged, the phthalates and BPA exposures were associated with a decrease in birth weight for male infants compared to the combined analysis (3 g decrease compared with 1 g increase).",1
The decrease in male birth weight associated with Pb exposure was roughly double the associated birth weight decrease in the combined analysis (94 g decrease compared with 45 g decrease).,1
There are some potentially interesting differences in the impact of DEP and DMP on birth weight when the study sample is stratified by infant sex.,1
"While DEP was associated with a 14 g increase in birth weight in the combined analysis, it was associated with a 51 g increase in males and a 9 g decrease in females in the sex stratified analysis.",1
"DMP in the combined analysis was associated with a 57 g decrease in birth weight; looking at the stratified analysis revealed that this decrease is greater in magnitude for male infants (88 g decrease), and lesser in female infants (27 g decrease).",1
The associations of greater magnitude present in male infants correspond with previously published studies [24].,1
Discussion\nIn this study we examined the relationship between gestational exposure to 53 different EDCs and birth weight in a prospective birth cohort of mother-infant pairs.,1
"We found that exposure to phthalates and BPA, PFAS, PCBs, PBDEs or OCPs had null or small associations with birth weight.",1
"Other investigators have reported similar small or statistically non-significant associations between birth weight and phthalates [37], PCBs [15], PBDEs [13], and OCPs [25].",1
"Several other studies, however, have found associations between increased exposure to phthalates, PCBs, PBDEs or OCPs whereas we did not.",1
[24] revealed that low birth weight infants in China tended to have much higher meconium phthalate levels than infants who were normal weight.,1
[21] reported that increased exposure to PCBs was associated with decreased birth weight.,1
[27] found a statistically significant inverse association between PBDE exposure and birth weight.,1
[18] both found changes in birth weight associated with increased OCP exposure.,1
"We found some evidence that PFAS, DMP and Pb were associated with small reductions in birth weight.",1
"On average, a 10-fold increase in exposure to the PFAS class was associated with an -11 g change in birth weight, 50% CI (-21, -2).",1
"However, due to the higher Type I error rate associated with using alpha level = 0.5, this association should be interpreted with caution.",1
"Similar findings concerning PFAS exposure have been reported elsewhere [5,19].",1
"While the exact mechanism by which PFAS impact birth weight is unknown, several theories have been proposed.",1
One explanation is that PFAS interact with estrogen receptors and disrupt hormonal balances [20].,1
"Additionally, PFAS alter human [20] and animal [3] serum lipid levels, potentially affecting fetal growth and development.",1
"Finally, PFAS affect adipose tissue development and the regulatory systems involved in body weight homeostasis, which may impact fetal growth outcomes [20], including those that occur after birth such as infant mortality or cardiovascular disease which are beyond the scope of this study [16,17].",1
"A 10-fold increase in Pb exposure was associated with a 45 g birth weight reduction (50% CI (-68, -22), while increased exposure to DMP was associated with a -57 g (50% CI(-79, -34)) change in birth weight.",1
"Both of these findings, as with the PFAS findings, should be interpreted cautiously because alpha = 0.5.",1
"They do, however, agree with previously published studies [14,39,45,46].",1
Having many exposure variables complicates the interpretation of associations between the 5 EDC classes and birth weight when using traditional multi-variable linear methods.,1
There were several limitations to the study.,1
"First, the BHLM model did not account for interactions between classes, and we assumed that all chemicals within a class share a similar mode of action and arise from a common prior distribution.",1
"Second, the model also excluded non-linear relationships, including potential threshold effects that could yield important information about the relationships between EDC exposure and birth weight.",1
"BHLM, because it is a shrinkage method, is also prone to higher Type II errors.",1
Non-persistent chemicals exhibit larger degrees of measurement error.,1
"For example, phthalates metabolites and BPA have short half-lives and this may have attenuated regression estimates and reduced statistical power [48].",1
"To reduce exposure misclassification, we pooled the exposures at 16 and 26 weeks [40].",1
"Lastly, we conducted these analyses under the assumption that structurally similar chemicals would have similar modes of action and therefore should be grouped together.",1
"Other grouping schemes, however, may be more informative.",1
Conclusion\nThis paper introduces BHLM as a method for tackling multiple correlated exposures in relation to health outcomes and compared this method with LASSO and Elastic Net.,1
LASSO and Elastic Net regression coefficients were larger in size but with less precise 95% intervals compared to BHLM.,1
Statistical theory demonstrates that the estimators have smaller mean squared error than ordinary least squares estimators [51].,1
BHLM also has the advantage that it yields estimates of the hyperparameters that aid in interpreting the effects of multiple correlated exposures.,1
"We showed that gestational exposure to phthalates and BPA, PCBs, PBDEs or OCPs had small or null associations with differences in birth weight.",1
"In contrast, and consistent with previous studies, PFAS, Pb, and OPP exposures were more strongly associated with reduced birth weight [19,39,45,46].",1
"Maternal vitamin D status, gestational diabetes and infant birth size\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nMaternal vitamin D status has been associated with both gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and fetal growth restriction, however, the evidence is inconsistent.",1
"In Finland, maternal vitamin D status has improved considerably due to national health policies.",1
"Our objective was to compare maternal 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentrations [25(OH)D] between mothers with and without GDM, and to investigate if an association existed between maternal vitamin D concentration and infant birth size.",1
Regression analysis confirmed no association between oral glucose tolerance test results and maternal 25(OH)D ( P \u2009>\u20090.53).,1
"However, mothers with optimal UCB 25(OH)D had newborns with smaller head circumference than those with suboptimal 25(OH)D ( P \u2009=\u20090.003), which was further confirmed as a linear association ( P \u2009=\u20090.024).",1
Conclusions\nMaternal vitamin D concentration was similar in mothers with and without GDM in a mostly vitamin D sufficient population.,1
Associations between maternal vitamin D status and birth size were inconsistent.,1
"A sufficient maternal vitamin D status, specified as 25(OH)D above 50\xa0nmol/L, may be a threshold above which the physiological requirements of pregnancy are achieved.",1
"Background\nVitamin D deficiency, defined as a circulating 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration below 50\xa0nmol/L, has been common among Finnish pregnant women [1].",1
"However, due to recent changes in national health policies, intake of vitamin D has increased resulting in decreasing rates of vitamin D deficiency [2–5].",1
"Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [6], but the evidence is inconsistent [7,8].",1
"Of all pregnancies, 1–14% are affected by GDM [9], and globally GDM prevalence has been increasing in line with increasing obesity [10].",1
GDM is the most common pregnancy complication in Europe [11].,1
"In Finland, the prevalence of GDM has increased from 6% in 2008 to 11% in 2014 [12].",1
"GDM increases the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, and the risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in later life both of the mother and the child [13].",1
Fetal growth may have later health implications also within the normal-birth-weight range [14].,1
Poor maternal vitamin D status has been related to fetal growth restriction [15] but it is unknown whether maternal vitamin D status associates with birth size in infants with normal birth weight.,1
"Many of the findings regarding the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and GDM are based on case-control studies, which may include a potential selection bias.",1
"Case-control studies often focus on high-risk groups, for example women who are overweight and sedentary, which are independent risk factors for vitamin D deficiency as well (for example [16]).",1
"The objectives of the present study were to compare 25(OH)D concentration at two consecutive time points between mothers with and without GDM, and to investigate associations between maternal factors and infant’s birth size, and the potential role of 25(OH)D concentration therein.",1
We employed UCB 25(OH)D to reflect both the maternal vitamin D status at the end of pregnancy and the newborn’s vitamin D status at birth [1].,1
"We defined vitamin D deficiency as 25(OH)D\u2009<\u200950\xa0nmol/L, and vitamin D sufficiency as 25(OH)D\u2009≥\u200950\xa0nmol/L, since a concentration of ≥50\xa0nmol/L is considered sufficient for bone health [17].",1
"Suboptimal vitamin D status was defined as 25(OH)D\u2009<\u200980\xa0nmol/L, and optimal vitamin D status as 25(OH)D\u2009≥\u200980\xa0nmol/L, as has been suggested based on calcium absorption studies [18].",1
"Total GWG was categorised into inadequate, adequate and excessive based on national recommendations by prepregnancy BMI: recommended GWG for underweight mothers was 12.5–18.0\xa0kg, for normal weight 11.5–16.0\xa0kg, for overweight 7.0–11.5\xa0kg, and for obese 5.0–9.0\xa0kg [19].",1
"Education was re-categorised into ‘lower’ and ‘higher’ education (lower\u2009=\u2009lower or upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education, higher\u2009=\u2009first or second stage of tertiary education), due to a low number of subjects in other education categories.",1
These data and the duration of pregnancy were retrospectively collected from birth records.,1
Assessment of GDM\nThe diagnosis of GDM was based on a two-hour 75\xa0g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).,1
"According to the national guidelines, GDM was diagnosed if the OGTT results exceeded cut-offs for one or more values: fasting plasma glucose ≥5.3\xa0mmol/l, 1-h\u2009≥\u200910.0\xa0mmol/l and 2-h\u2009≥\u20098.6\xa0mmol/l [19].",1
"In general, screening for GDM depends on a presence of risk factors according to national recommendations [19] and based on these, OGTT was performed on 490 (54.5%) of the participating mothers.",1
Season with four categories affected maternal 25(OH)D concentrations.,1
The data included partially missing information.,1
Imputation of missing values for education ( n \u2009=\u200912) and parity ( n \u2009=\u20092) were conducted using the median value in subgroups by GDM status.,1
Missing data on prepregnancy smoking as number of cigarettes daily were imputed as a median value (= zero) by GDM status according to smoking status ( n \u2009=\u200922).,1
Imputation of missing values for GWG at 12 gestational weeks was conducted using a mean value of two consecutive measurements ( n \u2009=\u200912).,1
Missing values of other variables were not imputed.,1
"Majority (95%) of the mothers took vitamin D supplements during pregnancy, most of them were highly educated (75% had at least a bachelor level education), and 73% had normal weight before pregnancy.",1
"No differences between the groups were observed in several other characteristics, including GWG, duration of gestation, and supplemental vitamin D intake.",1
We investigated whether pregnancy 25(OH)D concentration differed between mothers with ( n \u2009=\u200981) and without GDM ( n \u2009=\u2009639) (Fig.,1
"Adjusted analysis confirmed no difference in mean\u2009±\u2009SEM pregnancy 25(OH)D concentration between GDM and non-GDM mothers (81.7\u2009±\u20092.3 vs 81.7\u2009±\u20090.8\xa0nmol/L, P \u2009=\u20090.99).",1
"Similarly in UCB, the adjusted analysis showed no difference in 25(OH)D concentrations in infants born to women with and without GDM (79.1\u2009±\u20092.3 vs 80.1\u2009±\u20090.8\xa0nmol/L, P \u2009=\u20090.69) (Fig.1).",1
"These results remained when only those who had undergone OGTT were included: pregnancy and UCB 25(OH)D concentrations were similar in GDM ( n \u2009=\u200980) and non-GDM mothers ( n \u2009=\u2009323) ( P \u2009=\u20090.94 and P \u2009=\u20090.43, respectively).",1
Maternal 25(OH)D concentrations were similar between non-GDM and GDM mothers.,1
"Abbreviations: 25(OH)D, 25-hydroxy vitamin D; UCB, umbilical cord blood; GDM, gestational diabetes mellitus\nWe further tested for possible associations between pregnancy 25(OH)D concentration and OGTT results with a univariate regression model.",1
"The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D\u2009<\u200950\xa0nmol/L] during pregnancy was similar between mothers with or without GDM [4.9% (4/81) vs 3.3% (21/642), P \u2009=\u20090.51].",1
"However, more GDM mothers were vitamin D deficient at the delivery compared with non-GDM mothers [7.4% (6/81) vs 2.8% (18/642) ( P \u2009=\u20090.042)].",1
"However, of these six deficient GDM-mothers five (83%) were smokers, and correspondingly in non-GDM mothers four out of eighteen were smokers (24%) ( P \u2009=\u20090.018).",1
Maternal 25(OH)D and newborn birth size\nThe effect of maternal factors on birth size in fully adjusted models is presented in Table\xa02and Fig.,1
"As compared to mothers with suboptimal pregnancy 25(OH)D, mothers with optimal pregnancy 25(OH)D had heavier newborns ( P \u2009=\u20090.010), but this positive association was not verified in linear regression (B 0.00; 95% CI -0.00, 0.01; P\u2009= \xa00.16).",1
Newborn head circumference was larger in those with suboptimal UBC 25(OH)D compared with mothers with optimal UCB 25(OH)D ( P \u2009=\u20090.003).,1
"Further, linear regression confirmed the inverse association between UCB 25(OH)D and head circumference (B -1.74; 95% CI -3.25, −0.23; P\u2009= \xa00.024).",1
"These results did not change after adjusting for mode of delivery (vaginal, vacuum assisted or caesarean section).",1
"Prepregnancy BMI, GWG, and parity had independent effects on birth size (Table2and Fig.2).",1
"Abbreviations: GWG, gestational weight gain; GDM, gestational diabetes mellitus; 25(OH)D, 25-hydroxy vitamin D; suboptimal, UCB, umbilical cord blood; 25(OH)D\u2009<\u200980\xa0nmol/L; optimal 25(OH)D\u2009≥\u200980\xa0nmol/L\n\nDiscussion\nThe primary focus of this work was to determine whether 25(OH)D concentration differs between mothers with and without GDM, and whether vitamin D status affects birth size in normal-birth-weight infants.",1
"Almost all mother-child pairs (97%) were vitamin D sufficient [25(OH)D\u2009≥\u200950\xa0nmol/L], and about half of the mother-child pairs had optimal vitamin D status [25(OH)D\u2009≥\u200980\xa0nmol/L].",1
Maternal 25(OH)D concentrations were similar in GDM and non-GDM mothers.,1
"Interestingly, pregnancy vitamin D status associated positively with birth weight, but an inverse association was observed between newborn vitamin D status and head circumference at birth.",1
(2016) concluded in their meta-analysis that maternal vitamin D insufficiency (< 50\xa0nmol/L or <75\xa0nmol/L) was associated with greater risk of GDM [6].,1
"However, they suggested that this applied only in developed countries and when no adjustments for confounders were made [6].",1
"In our study, maternal vitamin D concentrations were similar in non-GDM and GDM mothers, and there was no linear association between vitamin D concentrations and OGTT results.",1
"However, we observed that vitamin D deficiency at delivery was more prevalent in mothers with GDM compared with non-GDM mothers, but this was not marked during pregnancy.",1
"This finding was possibly confounded by smoking, which was more prevalent in the deficient GDM mothers compared with deficient non-GDM mothers.",1
Nevertheless due to small number of deficient mothers we could not investigate this reliably.,1
"In accordance with other studies, our results imply that in a vitamin D sufficient population, the association between 25(OH)D and GDM may not exist [8,21,22].",1
"Similarly, Josefson et al.",1
"(2016) stated that maternal fasting glucose or GDM status was not associated with pregnancy 25(OH)D, which in their study was on average 93\xa0nmol/L [23].",1
"GDM is a multifactorial disease involving various risk factors, for example lifestyle factors, obesity, rapid weight gain and predisposing genetic factors.",1
"Furthermore, some of these factors are related to or co-exist with poor vitamin D status [24,25], which further increases the challenge when dissecting independent effect.",1
"It is possible that in previous studies where no adjustment for confounding factors was performed, the association between 25(OH)D and GDM reflects shared factors such as an unhealthy lifestyle or adiposity [26].",1
"Yet, contrary to many studies, associations between high 25(OH)D and GDM have been reported [27,28].",1
"Although a biological mechanism between low vitamin D status and diabetes is plausible [29], only a few interventions have been conducted, and these have not proved an effect of vitamin D supplementation on risk of GDM [30].",1
"Maternal vitamin D status associated with birth size: pregnancy 25(OH)D showed a positive association towards birth weight, but UCB 25(OH)D an inverse association with head circumference, while only the inverse association with head circumference was verified with linear model.",1
(2014) concluded that modest evidence exist for a positive relation between maternal vitamin D status and birth weight [31].,1
"Some earlier studies have shown that severe maternal vitamin D deficiency associates with smaller head circumference at birth [32,33], yet some have not [34,35].",1
"In agreement with our findings, others have discovered that mothers with higher vitamin D concentration have infants with smaller head circumference at birth [36,37].",1
"However, the clinical relevance, if any, of the inverse relationship between maternal vitamin D status and head circumference at birth remains unexplained.",1
"It is unknown whether this reflects differences in brain size or in skull bones’ structure, and needs to be explored in future studies.",1
A possible explanation for this might be a U-shaped association between maternal vitamin D concentration and fetal outcomes in a population with sufficient vitamin D status.,1
We have previously suggested the U-shaped association between 25(OH)D concentration and inflammatory biomarkers in cord blood [5].,1
We have collected a homogenous cohort of Caucasian mothers from the capital region of Finland representing mothers without regular medication and their newborns who were born at term with normal birth weight.,1
"In many previous studies, participants had various ethnic backgrounds which could affect both vitamin D status and their risk of GDM [7,38].",1
"A strength of the present study lies in the recruitment of subjects, which took place in a single hospital, enabled standardised data collection and covered all seasons.",1
"However, a multi-centre study might have resulted in a wider variety of socio-economic backgrounds.",1
"A challenge in previous studies on vitamin D status and GDM has been the lack of relevant adjustments, for example adjustments for BMI and smoking status [6].",1
"In the present study, we have systematically investigated confounders between groups, and adjusted for those when applicable.",1
"The threshold for defining vitamin D deficiency and the diagnostic criteria for GDM vary between studies, which might affect the results and complicate the comparison of studies.",1
"A further limitation is that the OGTT was not performed on all mothers, and a slight possibility exists that the actual prevalence of GDM might be underestimated.",1
"Yet, our main results were repeated in a subgroup analysis of only those women to whom an OGTT was performed.",1
"In addition, the prevalence of GDM was in accordance with the national statistics [12].",1
"However, in a cross-sectional setting causal relationships cannot be determined.",1
"Conclusion\nIn summary, maternal vitamin D concentration was similar in mothers with and without GDM in a vitamin D sufficient population.",1
"Furthermore, we found an inverse association between UCB 25(OH)D and infant head circumference.",1
The clinical relevance of this finding remains unsolved and needs to be considered in future studies.,1
"Sufficient maternal vitamin D status, specified as 25(OH)D above 50\xa0nmol/L, seems a threshold value, above which the physiological requirements of pregnancy are achieved.",1
Our findings suggest that an adequate maternal vitamin status have been achieved in Finland.,1
"However, randomised controlled trials are required in specific risk groups of vitamin D deficiency to clarify if vitamin D supplementation affects the risk of GDM.",1
