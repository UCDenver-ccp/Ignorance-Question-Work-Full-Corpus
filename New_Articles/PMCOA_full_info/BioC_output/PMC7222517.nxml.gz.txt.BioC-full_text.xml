The incidence of the disease has a bimodal distribution, with peaks occurring in children and older adults. Our group previously published the results of a transcriptome analysis of pediatric ACPs that identified several genes that were consistently overexpressed relative to other pediatric brain tumors and normal tissue. We now present the results of a transcriptome analysis comparing pediatric to adult ACP to identify biological differences between these groups that may provide novel therapeutic insights or support the assertion that potential therapies identified through the study of pediatric ACP may also have a role in adult ACP. Using our compiled transcriptome dataset of 27 pediatric and 9 adult ACPs, obtained through the Advancing Treatment for Pediatric Craniopharyngioma Consortium, we interrogated potential age-related transcriptional differences using several rigorous mathematical analyses. These included: canonical differential expression analysis; divisive, agglomerative, and probabilistic based hierarchical clustering; information theory based characterizations; and the deep learning approach, HD Spot. Our work indicates that there is no therapeutically relevant difference in ACP gene expression based on age. As such, potential therapeutic targets identified in pediatric ACP are also likely to have relvance for adult patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1673</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1686</offset><text>Adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma (ACP) is a histologically benign brain tumor that arises in the sellar/suprasellar region. Despite being a WHO grade I lesion, ACP often follows a clinically aggressive course and has been associated with the worst quality of life outcomes of any pediatric brain tumor. Unlike its histological counterpart, Papillary Craniopharyngioma (PCP), ACP is characterized by bimodal incidence, with spikes during childhood and adulthood. Also unlike PCP, for which promising therapies targeting the BRAFv600e mutation are in clinical trials, ACP is known to harbor only a mutation in the CTNNB1 gene, leading to a failure of normal Î²-Catenin degradation, with resultant cytoplasmic and nuclear accumulation in a subset of cells, where it can act as a transcription factor that may promote ACP pathogenesis. Unfortunately, this understanding has not yet led to the introduction of effective targeted therapies against ACP. As such, current therapies consist primarily of surgery, radiation and intracystic treatments. While downstream effects of the CTNNB1 mutation appear to be the most likely driver mutation in ACP, it is likely that tumorigenesis is multifactorial. Recent studies of the human ACP transcriptome, using both microarray and RNA sequencing, have identified potential novel therapeutic targets. However, this work has focused exclusively on pediatric tumors, leaving open the question of whether these potential therapies could be relevant in adult patients, who represent approximately 69% of all patients with ACP.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3248</offset><text>This work sought to investigate, using bulk RNA sequencing of adult and pediatric ACP, whether there is evidence that patients with ACP from different age cohorts could be expected to respond to the same targeted therapeutic strategies.

AGNES was implemented with the complete-linkage method. Complete-linkage clustering groups variables by their most dissimilar members and also avoids combining clusters with highly similar elements (as opposed to single-linkage). As shown below in Fig.Â 1b, we expect no linear dissimilarity between transcriptomes relative to age group, making complete-linkage an appropriate clustering strategy. As subtle differences in the gene expression patterns could be expected, complete-linkage was employed due to its superiority over a single-linkage approach in handling data groups that closely neighbor one another. DIANA and AGNES calculate metrics for cluster organization known as the Divisive Coefficient (DC) and Agglomerative Coefficient (AC), respectively. These coefficients range between 0 and 1, and indicate the precision with which the dendrogram describes the data, with 1 being the most ideal structure and 0 being the worst. As FANNY is not a hierarchical algorithm, and is visualized in principal component space, the percent of variance explained serves as a surrogate value for AC and DC (i.e., a larger percent variance explained value indicates how well a datasets information is represented in the decomposed space). </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9686</offset><text>Although cluster analysis is a primarily descriptive mathematical technique, we calculated the silhouette width as a means to make a quantitative comparison of the differential expression data.

While these types of modules are interesting they often require predefined lists.

While this is most commonly used to compare machine learning outputs to ground truth distributions, we employed it by treating one distribution (e.g., pediatric) as the predicted distribution and the other distribution (e.g., adult) as the target distribution (e.g. âground truthâ). This scenario effectively asks the following question: given the expression distribution of the adult cohort, how well can the distribution of the pediatric cohort be predicted. To calculate DKL, raw feature counts generated by RSubread were first class-balanced using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) via the python imblearn package.

Shapley values can conceptually be understood as importance scores. In this context, a higher Shapley value means a transcript is more important in determining the age group from which the sample was taken. The top 50 transcripts ranked by Shapley value and the list of 20 previously identified therapeutic targets were then submitted for Metascape express analysis to explore potential ontologic connections between gene sets using GO terms.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>13416</offset><text>Results</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>13424</offset><text>Canonical differential expression analysis reveals no therapeutically relevant distinction between adult and pediatric ACP specimens</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13557</offset><text>Overall, 87.3% of the transcripts interrogated were insignificant (IHW p-value &gt;â0.1) and slightly more transcripts enriched within the pediatric population versus the adult population (6.8% versus 5.9%, respectively, Fig. 1a). Considerable heterogeneity between all samples (irrespective of age group) was identified with the Euclidean distance matrix (Fig. 1b). Both the agglomerative and divisive clustering algorithms demonstrated reliable data organization (Fig. 1c-d; Divisive Coefficient [DC]â=â0.66, Agglomerative Coefficient [AC]â=â0.59) as well as the absence of distinct clusters between the adult and pediatric ACP samples. Congruently, probabilistic analysis in 2D principal component space, using FANNY, depicted nearly 70 % of the data variance (69.93%, Fig. 1e) and failed to partition the data into groups based on age cohort. Further analyses of these clustering approaches, using silhouette plots to quantify clustering integrity, demonstrated that kÂ =â2 yields the optimal clustering (Fig. 1f-h). However, all silhouette widths are close to 0 (maximum â 0.30), indicating that clusters are not unique from one another and cluster memberships could easily be randomized another way. When examined as a whole, agglomerative, divisive, and probabilistic clustering algorithms yield consistent and well-organized results, indicating that the transcriptomes of ACP specimens do not cluster based on the age of the patient from which they were obtained.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">40478_2020_939_Fig2_HTML.jpg</infon><infon key="id">Fig2</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>15040</offset><text>Transcriptional Profiling of Previously Identified Therapeutic Targets. a Previously identified therapeutic targets with transcriptions fold-change metrics for adult versus pediatric samples.

Accordingly, we validated these targets in the current dataset compared to normal pituitary (Figure S1) and created a subset of the transcriptome data focusing on these twenty targets to assess differential expression status (Fig.Â 2a and b). Of the previously identified potential targets, three genes were significant (IHW p-value &lt;â0.1): SHH, MAPK14, and AREG. Next, this data subset was subjected to the same divisive, agglomerative, and probabilistic clustering protocols (Fig. 2c-e) as the total dataset above.

Additionally, kÂ =â2 remained the superior cluster count but higher k values improved relative to the clustering performance of the full transcriptome (Fig. 2f-h). Although four genes were significantly differentially expressed, the data subset remained linearly undifferentiable based on age. In other words, these results indicate that there is no direct linear relationship between transcriptional profiles and age group at diagnosis. </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>17922</offset><text>Information theory and machine learning techniques identify a cohort of transcripts relevant to differentiating adult and pediatric patients</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">40478_2020_939_Fig3_HTML.jpg</infon><infon key="id">Fig3</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>18063</offset><text>Information Theory-Based Analysis Suggests Majority of Genes Have Minimal Linear and Non-linear Relationships with Age Groups. a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence representation of SHH (top) and IL6R (bottom) distributions for adult and pediatric samples. b KL-divergence versus Log Fold Change plot, with previously identified therapeutic targets overlaid and all points colored by IHW-adjusted p-value, demonstrating relationship between calculated LFC and informational differences.

The remaining 0.03% was composed of a mixed collection of transcripts that have not been implicated in tumor pathogenesis or therapy, and LFCs were modest.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24536</offset><text>Next, we sought to qualitatively examine non-linear transcriptional relationships to age group by utilizing KL-divergence. This again demonstrated that the global transcriptome profile for pediatric ACP differs very little from that of adult ACP. Quantitative assessment of linear and non-linear relationships using MIC vs. Pearsonâs R plots revealed that over 99% of transcripts do not possess strong relationships of any type to age group. Importantly, the required synthetic expansion of the dataset (see Methods) in order to calculate DKL and MIC would be expected to artificially magnify any data relationships. Therefore, the lack of any clear relationship between transcript expression and age group in this context further supports the assertion that the adult and pediatric transcriptomes lack therapeutically relevant differeces.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25378</offset><text>The threshold selected to distinguish adult from pediatric ACP (age 18âyears) may be considered arbitrary. However, the bimodal age distribution of ACP incidence includes a nadir between age 20 and age 39. This implies that there may be a distinction, on some level, between the tumors that present before and after this window. The age threshold of 18âyears has further clinical significance because it relates to the clinical environment (pediatric vs. adult) in which a patient may receive care. Furthermore, by leveraging the deep learning technique HD Spot, we identified genes, in a manner free of human-interpreter bias, that have age group dependent expression profiles. HD Spot accurately discriminated between pediatric and adult transcriptomes. The top 50 genes contributing to this classification were primarily comprised of genomic features that are currently poorly understood (e.g., pseudogenes, novel transcripts, etc.). Through utilizing classical genomic analysis protocols, information theoretic models, and deep learning this work rigorously interrogated linear and non-linear relationships to demonstrate that, at the transcript level, there is no evidence to differentiate therapy between adult and pediatric ACP patients strictly based on age at diagnosis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>26662</offset><text>Limitations</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26674</offset><text>Despite the rigorous characterization of the transcriptional relationship between pediatric and adult ACP tumor tissue, our findings are limited by the fact that only RNA expression profiles were considered. This provides a specific window into the genomic landscape. It does not provide thorough insight into potential differences in the epigenetic environment or extracellular milieu between pediatric and adult ACP. Furthermore, the transcriptome data analyzed was generated through bulk RNA sequencing. Given heterogeneous nature of ACP tissue, bulk sequencing is likely to lose some information, which may be explored in more detail with techniques such as single cell RNAseq, RNA mutation analysis or protein-level quantification. Lastly, there is also still potential that an even larger dataset contrasting these age groups (which to our knowledge does not exist) may still reveal more therapeutically important differences. Such studies may identify biological distinctions that could guide therapeutic intervention, even if this is at the level of second or third line therapy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>27762</offset><text>Conclusions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27774</offset><text>Analysis using multiple bioinformatic techniques, including the Deep Learning method, HD Spot, indicates that there is no therapeutically relevant distinction between ACP tissuein adult and pediatric patient. This implies that the identification of biologically-guided therapeutic targets, and the potential clinical translation of such targets in either group of patients may also be relevant in the other. As such, recent and future findings regarding ACP may be applied for the benefit of a larger group of patients. Future work including more in depth study of RNA features, protein expression and extracellular characteristics of these tumors will be necessary.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>28441</offset><text>Supplementary information</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>28467</offset><text>Publisherâs Note</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>28486</offset><text>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>28605</offset><text>Supplementary information</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28631</offset><text>Supplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1186/s40478-020-00939-0.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">AUTH_CONT</infon><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>28711</offset><text>Authorsâ contributions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">AUTH_CONT</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28736</offset><text>Primary Authors: EP, RW.
