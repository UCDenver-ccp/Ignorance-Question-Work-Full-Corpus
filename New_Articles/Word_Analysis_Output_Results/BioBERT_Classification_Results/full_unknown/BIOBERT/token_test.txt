The

The

Progress

Lac

the

a

in

between
50

The
clinical
relevance
of
AC
##P
is
not
their
associated
mortality
,
which
is
usually
low
when
properly
managed
,
but
their
high
m
##or
##bid
##ity
due
to
serious

The

supported

[SEP]
[CLS]
AC

is
among
a

number
of

in
which
tumor

can

of

[SEP]
[CLS]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
As
such
,
AC
##P
has
been
associated
with
the
lowest
quality
of
life
scores
of
any
p
##ediatric
brain
tumor
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
##rap

for

with

-
directed

,
such

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
None
of
these
approaches
,
however
,
are
directed
against
unique
biological
characteristics
of
AC
##P
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Furthermore
,
after
many
years
of
use
,
each
has
been
shown
to
be
associated
with
short
##coming
##s
regarding
clinical
efficacy
and
/
or
side
effects
especially
when
observed
within
the
[SEP]
[CLS]
framework
of
AC
##P
as
a
chronic
disease
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Basic
science
research
in
AC
##P
has
demonstrated
a
single
re
##current
so
##matic
mutation
of
the
CT
##N
##N
##B
##1
gene
,
which
leads
to
W
##NT
pathway
activation
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
mutation
is
,
unfortunately
,
not
currently
therapeutic
##ally
target
##able
and
is
present
in
a
minority
of
AC
##P
cells
,
suggesting
additional
path
##ogenic
drivers
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Work
using
recently
developed
genetically
engineered
mouse
models
(
GE
##MM
##s
)
of
AC
##P
indicates
that
the
tumor
arises
from
precursor
##s
of
the
anterior
pit
##uit
##ary
g
##land
or
Rat
##h
##ke
'
s
Po
##uch
[SEP]

hence
,
AC
##P
may
not
reside

##ri
##vil
##ege
##d
location
behind
the
blood

brain
barrier
[
B

]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Further
work
suggests
that
a
unique
para
##c
##rine
mechanism
drives
path
##ological
tumor
behavior
by
cells
that
lack
the
CT
##N
##N
##B
##1
mutation
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
assertion
is
supported
by
work
describing
both
the
p
##ediatric
AC

trans
##cript
##ome
and
inflammatory
mi
##lie

,
which

As

much

alternative

which

[SEP]

These

resulted
in
the
identification
of
multiple
molecular

A

The

this

is
reflective
of
the

The
mechanism

in

A
significant
and
growing
body
of
evidence
points
to
a
critical
role
in
the
activation
of
inflammation
and
the
immune

in
the
path

of
AC
##P
.
[SEP]

Multiple

have

in
both

techniques
to
demonstrate

involved
in
the
inflammatory

in
these

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
A
number
of
these
markers
represent
attractive
potential
targets
for
directed
therapy
in
the
treatment
of
AC
##P
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Specifically
,
due
to
existing
experience
combined
with
proven
efficacy
in
other
cancer

,
IL

and
the

may
represent

the

[SEP]

Similarly
,
combinations
of
such
agents
have
proven
very
effective
in
pro

in

cancer
such
as

and

that

[SEP]

Such

therapy
may
also
present
a
potential
therapeutic
strategy
in
the
management
of
re

AC
##P
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
addition
,
these
agents
might
also
be
combined
with
agents
that
do
not
specifically
interact
with
inflammatory

immune
processes
(

[SEP]

In

,
A

demonstrated
that
MA

likely
plays
a
pivotal

in
the

of
both
m

In

they
showed
that
treating
human

resulted
in
decreased

and
increased
a

[SEP]

Finally
,
recent
work
has
also
demonstrated
the
pivotal
role
played
by
se
##nes
##cence
and
the
SAS
##P
in
the
path
##ogen
##esis
of
these
tumors
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
It
is
possible
that
the
strong
SAS
##P
signature
drives
much
of
the
inflammation
seen
in
AC
##P
,
and
that
targeting
SAS
##P
associated
pathways
may
provide
an
effective
treatment
strategy
in
[SEP]
[CLS]
the
future
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Due
to
the
ben
##ign
his
##to
##logical
nature
of
the
disease
,
it
is
likely
that
initial
clinical
trials
of
such
agents
will
be
reserved
for
patients
with
re
##current
or
progressive
disease
[SEP]
[CLS]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
addition
,
due
to
the
r
##arity
of
the
disease
and
the
scar
##city
of
tumor

it
is
vital
that
p

continue
to
work

in
an
effort
to
accelerate
the

[SEP]

Such
efforts
will
hopefully
result
in
improved
outcomes
for

suffering
from

often
devastating

[SEP]

Finally
,
other

This

Introduction
Deep

of
artificial

that
construct
##s
general

for

via
a
multi

abstract
##ion
process
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
A

classification
of
visual
information
is
known
as
a
Con
##vo

N

Network
(
CNN
)
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
CNN
##s
are
constructed
using
multiple
se
##quential
layers
containing
variants
of
the
multi
-
layer
per
##ce
##pt
##ron
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
These
networks
have
demonstrated
general
##ization
capacity
for
identifying
both
linear
and
non
-
linear
late
##nt
patterns
that
lead
to
different
##iable
information
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
CNN
##s
and
other
variants
have
had
great
success
in
tasks
such
as
image
object
recognition
;
speech

,
translation
,
and
generation
;
and
medical
diagnostic

,

,
[SEP]
[CLS]
and
drug

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
These
applications
have
achieved
remarkable
success
,
to
some
extent
by
lever
##aging
very
large
amounts
of
labeled
training
data
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
An
example
is
the
Image
##Net
Large
Scale
Visual
Re
##cognition
Challenge
(
IL
##VS
##RC
)
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This

challenges
competitors
to
advance
the
state
of
the
art
in
computer

and

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Using
the
Image
##Net
data
##set
,
comprising
over
1
.
4
million
images
across
more
than
1000
possible
categories
,
CNN
##s
are
achieving
error
rates
under
5
%
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Within
the
healthcare
space
,
reliable
CNN
in
##ference
models
have
been
described
under
conditions
when
vast
amounts
of
training
data
are
available
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Examples
include
der
##mat
##ological
diseases
and
di
##abe
##tic
re
##tino
##pathy
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
when
such
models
are
trained
on
more
limited
data
##sets
,
the
results
are
often
unreliable
,
as
the
models
over
##fit
the
training
data
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
More
specifically
,
in
a
small
-
data
context
,
the
late
##nt
features
that
a
network
models
are
likely
to
result
from
sampling
noise
that
exists
only
in
the
training
[SEP]
[CLS]
data
,
and
not
in
novel
test
data
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Without
techniques
to
overcome
this
general
##ization
problem
,
CNN
##s
may
have
limited
applications
for
less
common
diseases
,
including
brain
tumors
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
One
technique
available
to
overcome
the
over
##fit
##ting
com
##plication
of
small
training
data
##sets
is
Transfer
Learning
(
T
##L
)
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
is
a
machine
learning
methodology
for
storing
knowledge
gained
from
solving
a
problem
within
one
domain
and
applying
that
knowledge
to
another
domain
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
success
of
T
##L
has
led
to
the
development
of
publicly
available
pre

trained
models
derived
from
top
IL
##SV
##RC
solutions
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
By
using
these
pre

to
generate

for
our

,
we

[SEP]

Another
technique
commonly
applied
to
image

problems
is
data
au

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This

synthetic

expands

)
[SEP]
[CLS]
to
real
data
in
an
attempt
to
preserve
domain
-
specific
features
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
We
employed
two
separate
data
au
##gment
##ation
approaches
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
first
was
a

[SEP]
[CLS]
While
this

an

that

be

in

[SEP]
[CLS]
Given
this
fairly
small
improvement
,
there
exists
a
computational
efficiency
argument
that
favors
the
use
of
the
s
##to
##cha
##stic
process
,
especially
in
early
stage
investigations
,
or
in
contexts
[SEP]
[CLS]
where
computational
resources
are
limited
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
our
study
,
the
s
##to
##cha
##stic
approach
yielded
superior
results
without
the
requirement
to
train
and
evaluate
complex
machine
-
learning
systems
and
with
lesser
computational
demand
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
An
additional
aspect
of
our
data
that
could
favor
the
use
of
s
##to

##stic
data
au
##gment
##ation
is
the
relative
con
##sp
##ic
##uity
of
the
critical
features
of
the
image
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Both
due
to
the
nature
of
a
tumor
being
a
mass
les
##ion
,
and
the
quality
of
current
medical
imaging
technologies
,
the
primary
source
of
different
##iable
information
in
the
[SEP]
[CLS]
images
that
compose
our

lies
within

[SEP]

The

the

[SEP]
[CLS]
Since
the

small

therefore
sensitive

there
is
concern

To

we

evaluated
our

using
five

fold

valid

(

##F

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Our
GA
previously
identified
that
augmented

were
ideal
for
training
and
original

were
ideal
for

,
thus
we
chose
to
evaluate
5

in

[SEP]

different

to
verify
that

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
To
further
verify
the
power
of
our
class

,
we
chose
two
separate
approaches
as
to
when

augmented
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Interest
##ingly
,
the

suggests
model

greater

(

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
We
see
that
for
CT

MR

,
au

only

yields
the
highest

This
is
particularly

the

that

we

Not

,
in

,
combining

together
resulted
in
higher
performance
across

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
is
likely
due
to
the
increase
in
relevant
information
put
forth
by
consideration
of
both

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Furthermore
,
it
is
also
interesting
that
we
see
the
base

performance
of

being
very
close
to
the

performance
in
contrast
to
the
larger
performance
improvement
seen
in
[SEP]
[CLS]
the
context
of

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
is
likely
due
to
the
intrinsic

between

that
the

etc

)
[SEP]
[CLS]
in
the

had
the
relative
greatest
impact
on
overall

performance
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Through
this
kind
of
perspective
it
is
possible
to
utilize
the
GA
to
extract
feature
importance
information
from
the
GA
search
space
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Additionally
,
the
as

of
our
optimization
algorithm
increased
efficiency
both
in
terms
of
the
number
of

to
consider
as
well
as
the
computational
time
and
resources
required
[SEP]
[CLS]
to
complete

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
offers
evidence
that
these

may
be
broadly
applied
to
the
development
of
other

in

[SEP]
[CLS]
As
this
work
represents
an
initial
exploration
of
these
method
##ologies
,
the
presented
model
may
be
improved
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
For
example
,
it
is
possible
that
the

algorithm
could
itself
be
op

##mized
by
a
GA
or
other
meta

he
##uristic
algorithm
,
such
as

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Another
possible
improvement
could
be
to
aggregate

from
all

as

thus
synthetic
