,
we
offer
the
following
observations
regarding
the
scope
of
our

and
limitations
of
the
methodology
applied
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
primary
objective
of
a

is
to
combine
the
results
of
previous
studies
examining
a
specific
research
question
to

at
a

about
a
[SEP]

body
of

[SEP]

This
statistical
pool

of
several

,
taking
into

the

are

[SEP]
[CLS]
It
cannot
,
however
,
correct
for
potential
bias
and
con
##found

of
the
studies
included
;
we
addressed
this
issue
in
our
review
(
Martin
et

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
2008
)
by
rating
the
quality
of
individual
studies
and
carrying
out
a
sensitivity
analysis
by
excluding
studies
for
which
the
quality
score
was
below
a
chosen
value
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
method
also
requires
that
included
studies
report
a
measure
of
association
such
as
a
risk
ratio
or
odds
ratio
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
For
this
reason
—
although
we
did
mention
impaired
sperm
##ato
##genesis
as
one
of
the
end
points
encompassed
by
the
test
##icular
d
##ys
##genesis
syndrome
—
it
was
necessary
to
exclude
this
end
[SEP]
[CLS]
point
from
our
analysis
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
previous
work
and
a
s
##co
##ping
study
,
we
found
that
most
of
the
research
carried
out
in
relation
to
impaired
sperm
##ato
##genesis
had
investigated
time
trends
rather
than
association
with
[SEP]
[CLS]
specific
risk
factors
(
Martin
et

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
2007
)
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Further
,
our
analysis
was
limited
to
pre
##nat
##al
exposure
to
est
##rogen
##ic
agents
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
A
number
of
studies
have
found
associations
between
sperm
m

or
sperm
DNA
damage
with
levels
of
est
##rogen

in

It
would
not

however
to
relate
such

This
also

the

is

[SEP]
[CLS]
The
key
factor
which
results
in
the
development
of
g
##esta
##tional
diabetes
appears
to
be
a
failure
to
compensate
with
increased
insulin

##ion
.

##As
the
increase
in
insulin
resistance
is
[SEP]
[CLS]
greatest
in
the
third
trim
##ester
,
G
##DM
usually
develops
going
into
this
period
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Therefore
,
screening
for
G
##DM
usually
occurs
around
24
–
28
weeks
into
the
pregnancy
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
diagnosis
is
made
with
an
oral
glucose
tolerance
test
,
though
the
criteria
vary
around

However
,
one

merits
discussion

[SEP]

Because
of
changes
in
the

over

,
Be

was
able

examine

who
would
have
been

[SEP]

as
having
G

by
contemporary
criteria
,
but
were
not
considered
to
have
G

at
the
time
,
and
were
therefore
un
##tre

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
per

rate
was
2

6

in
these

in

,
compared
to

7

,
in

[SEP]

after

been

for

[SEP]

Their

In

their

not

[SEP]

It
therefore
seems
likely
that
the
decreased

was
at

in

a
consequence

[SEP]

In

because
the

eat

[SEP]

Several

In

[SEP]

Not
only
do
such
advertisements
promote
eating
,
but
eating
while
watching

also
often
leads
to
over

because
children
do
not
notice
how

A

[SEP]

To

The

becomes
even
more

in

these

This

[SEP]
[CLS]
To
combat
pre

,
pregnant

should

encouraged

consume
a
diet
low

breast

may
decrease

particularly
in
children
born

mothers
.
[SEP]

Because
women
are
more
motivated

change

during

and
immediately
post

these

can
be
targeted
to

of
both

[SEP]

Inter

##s
to

The

the

was
to
investigate
the

differing

Additionally
,
we
investigated
whether
a
lifetime

by

has
differing

to
high

that
is
restricted
to

and
la
##ct

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
After
birth
,
offspring
were
further
challenged
by
a
diet
that
was
either
standard
rat
ch

or
high

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
We
evaluated
growth
,
timing
of
reproductive
mat
##uration
and
adult
o
##var

[SEP]
[CLS]
We
report
that
early

ca

,
either
before

,
consistently
accelerate

[SEP]

Although
we
report
that
the
combination
of
pre
##nat
##al
ca

restriction
and
post

high

nutrition
also
advanced
the
age
at

this
was
not

[SEP]

In

there

to
support
that

The

,
our
determination

duration

s

##ing
was
based
on
reports
made
early

,
so
reporting
was
not
conditional
on

outcomes
or
on
signs
[SEP]
[CLS]
and
symptoms
of
G

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Our
results
suggest
that
habit
##ual
short

long
sleep
duration
and

pre
##cede
the
clinical

.
[SEP]

Second
,
the
high
follow

up
rate
(

)
minimize
##d
possible
selection
bias

Our

provide
further

the

that

may
be
involved
in
the
bio

basis
for

[

[SEP]

This
suggestion
has
earlier
been
supported
by
ecological
studies
showing
that
variations
in

outcome
between

may
be
due
to

in

[

Further
evidence
for
the
hypothesis
that
P

##FA
is
involved
in
the
et
##iology
of
psychiatric
disease
has
been
put
forward
through

showing
a

[

,
as
well
as
studies

that

Finally
,
supplement

has
been
reported
to
be

Our

Pre

has
been
proposed
to
be
a
risk
factor
for
the
development

[
12
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Results
from
the
Northern
Finland
1966
Birth
Co
##hor
##t
showed
that
vitamin
D
supplement
##ation
during
the
first
year
of

was
associated
with
a
reduced
risk
of
s
##chi
##zophrenia
in
males
,
[SEP]
[CLS]
but
not
in
women
[
32

[SEP]

However
,
a
small
pilot
study
of
maternal
vitamin
D
levels
in
archive
##d
pre

##al
se
##ra
,
showed
no
decrease
in
pre

##al
vitamin
D
in
subjects
who
later
developed
s
##chi
##zophrenia
[
[SEP]
[CLS]
33
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
It
has
been
hypothesis
##ed
that
vitamin
D
ins
##uff
##iciency
could
account
for
some
of
the
increased
risk
of
s
##chi
##zophrenia
observed
among
dark

immigrants
moving
to
countries
with
less
sun
[SEP]

[

[SEP]
[CLS]
Vita
##min
D
is
to
a
large
extent
meta
##bol
##ized
in
the
body
through
sun
exposure
,
and
people
with
dark
skin
need
more
sun
exposure
to
maintain
adequate
blood
levels
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Our
results
of
a
protective
effect
of
vitamin
D
intake
must
be
considered
as
rough
,
since
we
only
measure
the
diet
##ary
intake
of
vitamin
D
.
A
more
complete
[SEP]
[CLS]
picture
of
the
vitamin
D
status
could
have
been
supplied
through
vitamin
D
levels
in
blood
;
however
,
no
biological
samples
are
available
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
absorption
of
diet
##ary
vitamin
D
is
generally
high
at
all
stages
of
life
[
34
]
,
but
serum
levels
also
depend
on
the
end
##ogen
##ous
production
of
vitamin
D
due
[SEP]
[CLS]
to
sun
exposure
which
is
subject
to
seasonal
variations
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Thus
,
the
correlation
between
vitamin
D
intake
and
serum
levels
may
vary
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
B
##urg

[SEP]

Our

be
due

Expo

Despite

the

Except

the

[SEP]

However
,
the
at

for
these

is
small
and
can
only
explain
a

Evidence
of
an

The

The

No

[SEP]

Several

if
such
an

[SEP]

Thus
far
,
the
major
evidence
in

of
a

involves
farming

all

with

Act

reported
that

,
the
10
patients

Even

some

the

If

one
would
expect

[SEP]

To
my

,
the

not
been

[SEP]

However
,
at

two

have
addressed
it
(

,
both
published
before
Ka

autism

[SEP]

Even
more
intriguing
,
both

report
that
the

Another
of
the

of

the

this
is
not

[SEP]
[CLS]
As
I
discussed
in
my
original

,
this
has
been
known
since
the
early
1980s
but
was
dismissed
as
being

[SEP]

This

co

well
with
a

(

,
which
found
a

the

[SEP]

If
the
vitamin

theory
is
true
,
autism
should
be
more
common
in
rich

well

,
who
are

If

we

a

[SEP]

Another
possibility
is
that
air

from

India

why

Obviously
,
another

is
that

[SEP]

Indeed
,
without
the

I
suspect
that
severe

to

If

the
path
towards

–
and
perhaps

if

A

is
unlikely
to

Although

Generally
,
there
is
a
lack
of
evidence
for

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Additional
recent
studies
about

reveal
that
components
other

such
as

may
influence

[

[SEP]
[CLS]
Therefore
,
no
special
diet
for
the
mother
is
required
during
pregnancy
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
On
the
contrary
,
the
diet
should
be
well
balanced
and
consist
of
as
many
different
nutrients
as
possible
,
as
the
current
literature
suggests
that
anti

obtained
via
the

and
la

are
needed
to
develop

[SEP]

In

with
this

there
was
no
association

the

avoiding
the

of

in

during

[

[SEP]

However
,
if
the
mother
is
already
all

or
if
there
is
a
family
history
of
atop

or
all
##er

,
food
comprising

In

the

In

government

65

the

The

The
possible

for

are
many
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
One
likely
reason
for
the

is
convenience

[SEP]

Weekly

The
2009
survey
identified
that
it
took
women
an
average
of
17
minutes
to
access
the
distribution
point
for
weekly
supplement
##s
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Another
reason
for
high
compliance
with
the
weekly
program
was
the
maintenance
of
a
reliable
supply
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
A
previous
study
has
shown
that
a
poor
distribution
system
and
irregular
availability
were
the
most
significant
environmental
risk
factors
for
taking
iron

continuously
[

[SEP]

Also
,
weekly
supplement
##s
may
be
better
tolerate
##d
,
with
less
frequent
side
-
effects
thereby
increasing
acceptance
and
compliance
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
extensive
training
and
community
education
program
was
another
positive
factor
which
increased
acceptance
of
the
supplement
##s
as
a
valuable
contribution
to
women

health
.
[SEP]

The
main
limitation
of

was
the
lack
of
a

where
no

was
given

One

Studies

[SEP]
[CLS]
Regardless
,
serum
calcium
in

and
in

is
likely
controlled
by
a

of
factors

of
which
vitamin

is
only
[SEP]
[CLS]
one
factor
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Limited
previous

is

[SEP]
[CLS]
Park
et

[

studied
Korean
infants
at

assessed

even
though
many
of
the
infants
had
very
low
25

OH

D

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
They
speculated
that
this
is
due
primarily
to
passive
absorption
of
calcium
at
this
age
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
It
has
been
suggested
but
is
not
proven
that
early
life
calcium
absorption
is
primarily
non
-
vitamin
D
dependent
[
2
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
it
is
likely
that
by
three
months
of
age
,
vitamin
D
has
a
key
role
in
calcium
absorption
,
especially
in
breast
-
fed
infants
with
a
[SEP]
[CLS]
relatively
low

compared

[SEP]
[CLS]
Whether
the
greater
bio
##ava
##ila
##bility
of
calcium
from
human
milk
compared
to
formula
affects
the
needed
level
of
25
(

by
infants
is
unknown
.
[SEP]

G
##reer

of

[SEP]

These

are
similar
to
ours
,
with
slightly
higher
25

D
values
found
in
the
G

.
[SEP]

Direct
comparisons
however
of
25

D
values
between

conducted

be

Therefore
,
in
considering
early

supplement

,
the
question
becomes
whether
there
is
physiological
benefit
to
rapid
re

whether
the

[SEP]

Our

from

can
only
be
used
to
partially
answer
this
question
specifically
related
to
bone
health
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
it
appears
that
,
at
least
in
a
southern
US
setting
,
400
I
##U
/
day
is
adequate
for
infants
regardless
of
vitamin
D
status
at
birth
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
We
cannot
rule
out
the
possibility
that
a
small
number
of
infants
will
be
h
##y
##po
##cal
##ce
##mic
in
the
first

with

,
but
,
this
appears
to
[SEP]
[CLS]
be
uncommon
and
may
be
more

to
PT

than

the

that

Nonetheless
,
such

[SEP]

The

[SEP]

It
has
been
suggested
that

all

have
their
25

[SEP]

Of
note
is
that
25

D

in
a
southern
United
States
climate
are
low
despite
sunshine
exposure
year
round
at
the

in
Houston
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Furthermore
,
there
is
a
seasonal
dependence
of
25
(
OH
)
D
levels
although
we
did
not
have
enough
subjects
to
identify
the
degree
to
which
this
seasonal
dependence
[SEP]
[CLS]
was
affected
by
ethnicity
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
We
had
previously
shown
a
seasonal

of
25

D

between

[SEP]
[CLS]
Thus
,
it
is
clear
that
a
southern

is
not
protective
against
seasonal

of
vitamin

or
low

The

For

is
one
of

Hence
,
thy

ranks
among

Although

In

it

play
a
crucial

For

and
therefore
may
play

[SEP]
[CLS]
Di

between

can
most
likely
be
explained
by
the

that

If

it

Introduction
Iron
deficiency
an
##ae
##mia
is
defined
as
an
##ae
##mia
accompanied
by
depleted
iron
stores
and
signs
of
a
compromised
supply
of
iron
to
the
tissues
[
1
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
There
is
variation
in
ha
##em
##og
##lo
##bin
levels
during
pregnancy
;
at
the
beginning
of
a
pregnancy
,
there
is
a
normal
reduction
in
ha
##em
##og
##lo
##bin
level
followed
by
a
slight
rise
towards
[SEP]
[CLS]
the
end
of
pregnancy
[
2
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
initial
reduction
has
been
explained
to
result
from
increased
red
cell
mass
and
demands
of
the
f
##etus
which
exceeds
iron
intake
with
con
##se
##quent
reduction
in
iron
stores
of
the
[SEP]
[CLS]
woman
'
s
body
[
2
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Thus
,
the
World
Health
Organization
has
defined
an
##ae
##mia
in
pregnancy
as
a
ha
##em
##og
##lo
##bin
value
below
11
g
/
d
##L
[
1
,
3
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
There
are
two
known
factors
which
contribute
to
development
of
iron
deficiency
an
##ae
##mia
(
ID
##A
)
in
pregnancy
;
the
first
is
the
woman
'
s
iron
stores
at
the
[SEP]
[CLS]
time
of
conception
and
the
second
is
the
amount
of
iron
absorbed
during
g
##esta
##tion
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
fact
that
an
##ae
##mia
frequently
does
occur
in
pregnancy
among
women
in
developing
countries
is
an
indication
that
pre
##ex
##ist
##ing
iron
stores
are
often
inadequate
and
physiological
adaptations
to
pregnancy
are
[SEP]
[CLS]
insufficient
to
meet
the
increased
requirements
[
4
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Hence
,
iron
supplement
##ation
in
pregnancy
has
become
a
standard
and
routine
practice
as
a
prevent
##ive
treatment
for
iron
deficiency

##ae
##mia

The
high
physiological
requirement
for
iron
in

is
difficult
to
meet
with
most
diet

;
this
is
so
especially
in
developing
countries
where
food
requirement
is
[SEP]
[CLS]
a
problem
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
During
pregnancy
,
iron
requirements
are
not
uniform
[
14

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
the
first
trim

,
daily

decrease
due
to
the
absence

thereby
saving
about

56

,
or
160

[SEP]
[CLS]
for
the

[

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
the
second
trim
##ester
,
blood

increases
by
45
%
with
an
increase
in
plasma
volume
of
50
%
;
red
cell
mass
is
raised
by
35
%
which
amounts
[SEP]
[CLS]
to
about
450
mg
of
iron
in
a
55

[

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Fe

demands
for

are

during

these
are
estimated
at
about
270
mg
in
a

f

[

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Therefore
,
an
average
daily
dose
of
4
–
6
mg
of
iron
is
required
in
the
second
and
third
trim
##ester
##s
of
pregnancy
[
14

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Overall
,
a
woman
requires
about
2
–
2
.
8
mg
of
iron
per
day
during
pregnancy
[
17

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
But
she
will
need
to
consume
much
more
to
obtain
this
daily
requirement
(
i

,
between
20
and
48
mg
of
diet
##ary
iron
)
[

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
literature
has
presented
different
views
on
iron
requirements
during
pregnancy
ranging
from
450
to
1

150
mg
with
a
median
of
79

mg
[
14

[SEP]

.
[SEP]

Since
these
requirements
are
difficult
to
meet
through
an
ordinary
diet
,
especially
in
developing
countries
where
most

routine

Direct

The
rational

to

An

The
World
Health
Organization
has
recommended
that
weekly
iron
and
f
##olic
acid
supplement
##ation
should
be
considered
as
a
strategy
for
prevention
of
iron
deficiency
in
population
groups
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
is
particularly
so
where
the
prevalence
of
an
##emia
is
above
20
%
among
women
of
reproductive
age
[
58
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Since
iron
tablets
induce
a
high
concentration
of
free
radical
##s
in
the
in
##test
##inal
mi
##lie
##u
,
which
may
damage
the

,
the
minimal
essential
iron
dose
is
to
be
[SEP]
[CLS]
recommended
[
59

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Therefore
,
there
is
a
need
to
establish
effective
and
safe
doses
of
supplement
##al
iron
with
f
##olic
acid
either
as
daily
or
weekly
supplement
##ation
;
this
should
take

nutrition

and
ha

of

in

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Though
compliance
with
weekly
dos
##age
may
be
better
than
daily
regime
##n
because
of
reduced
side
effects
,
it
is
desirable
to
conduct
further
field
random
##ized
controlled
trials
in
order
to
[SEP]
[CLS]
establish
the
efficacy
of
weekly
supplement
##ation
compared
to
daily
regime
##n
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Alternatively
,
an
equally
effective
,
safe
,
and
affordable
iron
compound
with
little
or
no
side
effect
can
be
developed
for
use
especially
in

ant

##ation
programmes
[SEP]
[CLS]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
To
this
end
,
we
recommend
a
cue
to
be
taken
from
new
approaches
to
iron
fortification
technology
development
whereby
iron

are
prevented
while
[SEP]

its

are
preserved
[
60

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
While
this
approach
is
being
pursued
,
we
recommend
that
appropriate
measures
be
taken
to
strengthen
the
existing
health

in
dealing

Thus

clinical

as
the

it

Although

However

another

a

lower

[SEP]

The

is
possibly
due

the
fact

more

The

In
the

we

likely
reflects
the

[SEP]

This
assumption
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
main
risk
factors
associated
with
vitamin

(

are
common

In

to
the

there
exists
also
a

Therefore
,
there
is

Given
the
high
prevalence
of
vitamin
D
deficiency
in
pregnant
women
in
Belgium
and
probably
in
many
European
countries
,
a
vitamin
D
nutrition
policy
is
needed
at
the
country
[SEP]
[CLS]
and
European
level
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
current
vitamin
D
recommendations
for
pregnant
women
are
clearly
insufficient
to
prevent
and
even
more
to
treat
vitamin
D
def
##icient
pregnant
women
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Until
the
adequate
treatment
of
vitamin
D
def
##icient
pregnant
women
is
established
,
a
safe
approach
may
be
to
correct
vitamin
D
deficiency
by
targeting
pregnant
women
at
high
risk
[SEP]
[CLS]
of
severe
vitamin
D
deficiency
.
[SEP]

In

the
current
vitamin

content
of

400
I

,
do
not
even
comply
with
the
current
Belgian
recommendations
of
800
I
##U
per

,
[SEP]
[CLS]
therefore
a
p
##rud
##ent
step
should
at
least
be
to
increase
the
vitamin
D
content
in
multi
##vi
##tam
##ins
for
pregnant
women
to
800
I
##U
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
conclusion
,
despite
that
more
than
60
%
of
the
pregnant
women
reported
taking
multi
##vi
##tam
##ins
containing
vitamin
D
,
vitamin
D

is
highly
prevalent
among
pregnant

in
[SEP]
[CLS]
Belgium
and
up

12
%
of

are
severely

[SEP]
[CLS]
A
targeted

strategy
to
detect

is
clearly
needed
in

The
mechanism

is
that

PT

causes
the

calcium

the

[SEP]

The

that

For

the

What

the

is

is

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
There
are
a
number
of
limitations
inherent
in
the
design
of
the
present
study
that
should
be
acknowledged
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Given
the
small
sample
size
,
un
##ad
##ju
##sted
models
were
used
in
most
of
the
analyses
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Therefore
,
we
were
unable
to
fully
assess
the
influence
of
con
##found
##ing
factors
in
S
##GA
mon
##otherapy
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Such
results
should
be
further
investigated
in
future
research
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Another
limitation
is
the
inability
to
address
con
##found
##ing
by
indication
and
separate
the
relative
effects
of
maternal
mental
illness
from
ps
##ych
##ot
##ropic
p

on

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Moreover
,
a
more
detailed
investigation
into
maternal
mental
health
,
which
includes
measures
of
the
frequency
and
severity
of
specific
psychiatric
symptoms
during
pregnancy
,
would
allow
for
a
[SEP]
[CLS]
more
thorough
investigation
into
these
critical
con
##found
##ing
variables
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Furthermore
,
evaluating
the
social
characteristics
of
the
assessed
co
##hor
##t
would
enable
us
to
identify
potential
con
##found
##ing
variables
that
may
affect
pregnancy
outcomes
,
such
as
socio
##economic
status
and
lifestyle
[SEP]
[CLS]
differences
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
women
who
contacted
Mother
##isk
tended
to
be
middle
to
upper
-
middle
class
,
which
represents
the
majority
of
the
population
,
and
may
be
higher
functioning
than
those
[SEP]
[CLS]
who
did
not
,
as
they
independently
sought
access
to
counsel
##ling
in
order
to
help
educate
themselves
on
the
potential
te
##rato
##genic
risks
associated
with
their
medications
.
16
##A
smaller
proportion
[SEP]
[CLS]
of
caller
##s
came
from
the
lower
socio
##economic
and
/
or
immigrant
population
;
however
,
this
may
not
affect
the
general
##isa
##bility
of
the
results
,
as
their
outcomes
may
be
[SEP]
[CLS]
con
##founded
by
other
factors
unrelated
to
the
drug
effect
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Although
the
women
were
recruited
prospective
##ly
,
there
are
potential
limitations
in
the
re
##tro
##spect
##ivity
of
a
database
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
conclusion
,
it
appears
that
ps
##ych
##ot
##ropic
p
##oly
##ther
##ap
##y
in
pregnant
women
with
mental
health
disorders
is
presently
a
common
practice
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
such
management
may
lead
to
an
increased
risk
of
adverse
pregnancy
outcomes
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Considering
that

that

not

The

The
historical
data
from

shows
that
a
moderate
increase

results
in
a
mortality

even
in
the

indicated
the

extend
to
the

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
A
study
of
26
##6
cases
and
matched

among
Navajo
births
over
18

suggested
that
children
of
women

were

83
times
[SEP]

more
likely

these

worked
at
an

assembly
plant
as
in

37
Animal
studies
[SEP]
[CLS]
suggest
potential
reproductive
implications
of
exposure
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
A

found
the
offspring
had
a
higher
body
burden
of
uranium
than

[SEP]

These
offspring
also
had
higher
rates
of
physiological
changes
,
including
at

##pical
sperm
formation
.
38
##A

a

produced

it

we

the

[SEP]

It
could
be
argued
that

routine
pre

in

does
not
usually
begin
until
after

including
advice
about
f

as
[SEP]
[CLS]
part
of

is
redundant
as
the

has
fully
developed

[SEP]
[CLS]
Nonetheless
,
f
##olic
acid
supplement
##ation
might
address
other
forms
of
an

the
advice
might
also
increase
the

The
observation
that
early

the

Furthermore
,
it

un

that

also
those

we

This

that
the

suggesting
that
there

[SEP]

Some

describe
a

The

is
an

the

This

of

,
especially
f

[

.
[SEP]

We
mit
##igate
##d
against
this
possible
source
of
error
by
asking
additional
questions
about
the
type
of
supplement

its
commercial

[SEP]
[CLS]
This
was
the
first
use
of
a

which
we
administered
2

to
include

who
may
not
have

[SEP]

Having
done
so
,
however
,
some
of
our

may
not
have
accurately

their
use
of
supplement
##s
early
in

or
before
conception

[SEP]

Even
though
our
results
highlight
the
importance
of
nutrition
##al
knowledge
in
the
decision
to
use
iron
or
f
##olic
acid
,
we
cannot
draw
conclusions
about
overall
compliance
with
supplement
regime
##s
[SEP]
[CLS]
,
because
we
did
not
record
the
dose
or

of

,
f

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Furthermore
,
we
did
not
record
when
during
the

the
supplement

were
taken
,
which
is
of
particular
importance
for
f
##olic

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
sample
size
of
our
study
was
determined
based
on
an
unknown
prevalence
of
supplement
##s
intake
(
which
was
set
by
default
to
be
50
%
)
,
but
may
have
been
[SEP]
[CLS]
too
small
to
accommodate
some
subgroup
analyses
;
we
must
therefore
be
cautious
about
the
conclusions
that
can
be
drawn
from
subgroup
analysis
and
test
the
h

that
arise
from
[SEP]
[CLS]
these
findings
in

[SEP]
[CLS]
As
this
is
an
observation

study
,
we
cannot
conclude
that
the
information
about
the
roles
or
sources
of
nutrients
or
general
recommendations
about
diet
during
pregnancy
directly
influence
the
[SEP]

We

that

for

the
use

Although
both

[SEP]

However
and
despite

there
is
a
wealth

literature
using
those
two

as
experimental

to
study
place

[SEP]
[CLS]
It
would
also
be
of
interest
to
expand
these

that

a
key
organ
responsible

also
assess
whether

we

There
was
no

[SEP]

Therefore
,
at
place

the

does
not
really
affect

[SEP]

We
acknowledge
that
our

included
small

certain
categories

[SEP]

Moreover
,
the
nature

was
not

further
analytical

are
needed
to
provide
con

evidence
for
a

Nevertheless
,
the
statistical

the

onset

,
much
of
this
research
has
been
overlooked
[
18
,
29
,
30

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
a
pilot
study
published
in
2012
,
we
were
the
first
to
specifically
report
differences
in
actual

between

[SEP]
[CLS]

[

[SEP]

The
present
study
involved
a
substantially
larger
sample
,
and
reinforce
##s
the
observed
association
between
25
(
OH
)
D
levels
and
S
-
EC
##C
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Much
of
the
early
research
in
this
field
was
conducted
by
May
Mel
##lan
##by
,
who
identified
an
association
between
vitamin
D
supplement
##ation
and
reduced
car

risk
[
18
,
[SEP]
[CLS]

]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Recently
,
a
meta
-
analysis
reported
that
vitamin
D
supplement
##ation
in
childhood
can
help
prevent
car
##ies
[
30
]
,
and
it
has
also
been
suggested
that
concentrations
of
25
[SEP]
[CLS]
(
OH
)
D
between
75
–
100
nm
##ol
/
L
may
reduce
the
risk
for
car
##ies
[
22
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Our
study
supports
these
findings
,
as
car
##ies
-
free
children
were
twice
as
likely
to
have
optimal
25
(
OH
)
D
concentrations
(
≥
75
nm
##ol
/
L
)
[SEP]
[CLS]
and
those
with
S
-
EC
##C
were
at
nearly
three
times
the
odds
of
having
def
##icient
levels
(
<
35
nm
##ol
/
L
)
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
mean
25
(
OH
)
D
level
in
our
sample
was
adequate
,
mirror
##ing
our
pilot
study
findings
[
14
]
and
those
of
the
Canadian
Health
Me
##asures
Survey
[SEP]
[CLS]
[
32
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
may
be
attributed
to
regular
milk
intake
,
which
was
common
in
both
groups
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Regular
milk
drink
##ers
had
better
vitamin

concentrations
,
a
finding
supported
by
a
large

clinical
study
observing
an
association
between
frequent
milk
consumption
and
increased
25

[SEP]
[CLS]

[

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Reg

techniques
were
employed
to
determine
whether
the
association
between

vitamin

remained
after

[SEP]

Even

,
and
in

the
significant

remained

[SEP]
[CLS]
Similarly
,
the
association
between
25
(

D
concentrations
and
S

##C
was
significant
after

[SEP]
[CLS]
the

[SEP]

As
there

a

education

Additionally
,

[SEP]

Natural

,
some

are
difficult

as

we

[SEP]

Additionally
,
the

involved
retrospective

In

Based
on
the
findings
of

we
conclude
that
:
•
Children

to
be

significantly
greater
odds
of
having
low

[SEP]

•
Children

are

,
as
they
displayed
significantly
lower

of

as
higher
levels

compared
to
[SEP]

This

suggests
a
clear
relationship
between
vitamin

and
the

of

[SEP]

As

,
it
may
be
advantage

for

The

novel
,
suggesting

[SEP]

A
limitation
is
the

particularly
when

averaged
9

A
further
limitation
is
the
possibility

The
model
allows
all

from
incomplete

to
be
used
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
A
linear
mixed

model
analysis
is
adopted
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Each
individual
has
a
family
id
and
within
a
family
individuals
are
also
numbered
according
to
the
group
to
which
they
belong
:

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
unit
in
the
model
is
the
family

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
mixed
model
includes
group

age
and

Χ
age
of
the

as
fixed

and
a

with
an

matrix
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Note
:
in
the
case
of
the

,
age
represents
the
exact
age
when
measurements
were
made
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
E
##st

##s
of
this

are
obtained
providing

child

,
child
with
father
and
so
on
,
[SEP]
[CLS]
together
with
p
values
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
These
correlation
##s
measure
the
degree
of
association
between
the
p
##hen
##otypic
values
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
p
value
of
each
correlation
(
or
equivalent
##ly
the
SE
of
the
correlation
)
is
adjusted
for
the
est
##imation
of
the
other
correlation
coefficients
and
the
fixed
effects
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
fixed
effects
are
chosen
to
account
for
different
mean
levels
of
B
##MI
for
the
sexes
and
for
different
generations
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
maternal
and
paternal
grandparents
had
separate
fixed
effects
,
that
is
,
a
different
effect
for
the
MGM
than
the
P
##GM
and
a
different
effect
for
the
MG
##F
than
[SEP]
[CLS]
the
P
##G
##F
as
the
populations
were
not
balanced
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
estimates
are
examined
for
patterns
by
sex
and
by
generation
across
families
so
that
possible
causes
may
be
in
##ferred
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
is
carried
out
at
each
age
point
of
the
index
child
—
at
birth
and
at
ages
5
and
9
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
an
analysis
of
change
between
the
different
ages
,
differences
in
B
##MI
for
different
age
groups
are
calculated
and
re

on
the
B
##MI
of
each

in

##I
##n
this

,
it
can
be
argued
that

[SEP]

on

common

both

are
cancelled
and
what
remains
are
differential

In

has
extended
this

Similar

were
seen
across

for

[SEP]
[CLS]
In
our
original
publication
,
we
used
examination

at
one

point
only
for
the
children
when
they
were
aged
5
;
we
now
report
examination

at
three
[SEP]

separate

including
a
completely
new
sweep
of

when

were

It
cannot
be
assumed
that
in
a
growing
child
these
relationships
with
family
members
would
remain
consistently
the
same
,
in
that
environmental
factors
would
come
more
into
play
as
[SEP]
[CLS]
the

grows
up
.
29
##As
children
grow
older
in
this

,
the
B

strengthen

presumably
because

shared

to
reinforce
this

[SEP]

both

also

[SEP]

This
is
therefore
a
novel
analysis
and
a
considerable
expansion
on
the

one

Not

is
this

also
it

[SEP]

The

is
one

genetically

[SEP]

because
as

as

interact
to
determine
a

Gene

have
found
genes
for
height
on
the
7th

,
as
well
as
on

[SEP]

the
degree
to
which
the

34
##U

##like
other

,
35
##we
did
not
find
her

for
post

to
be
higher
for
[SEP]
[CLS]
maternal
height
than
for
paternal
height
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
our
analysis
,
it
was
found
that
the
child
’
s
height
was
correlated
with
that
of
all
family
members
at
age
5
,
suggesting
perhaps
many
genetic
effects
[SEP]
[CLS]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Thus
,
the
common
estimate
of
her
##ita
##bility
assuming
add
##itive
genetic
effects
may
not
work
for
height
.
36
##H
##ow
##ever
,
at

,
height
was
primarily
correlated
in
[SEP]

similar
correlation

were
observed
for
the
parents
with

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Interest
##ingly
,
the
height
of
the
child
continued
at
ages
5
and
9
to
be
strongly
correlated
with
that
of
the
P
##G
##F
,
not
easily
explain
##able
by
conventional
genetic
inheritance
[SEP]
[CLS]
,
though
there
may
be
a
Y
-
related
influence
at
play
through
the
father
,
who
himself
is
highly
correlated
with
his
father
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
There
was
a
systematic
and
statistical
##ly
significant
difference
in
the
height
of
the
two
groups
of
fathers
—
those
reported
were
significantly
taller
than
those
measured
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
may
be
because
reported
data
were
exaggerated
by
the
partner
or
because
,
for
some
reason
,
reported
is
a
health
##ier
group
than
measured
height
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
For
the
small
numbers
of
fathers
we
measured
,
there
was
a
significantly
lower
height
than
in
those
we
reported
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
the
latter
explanation
is
less
likely
since
the
two
groups
do
not
differ
in
weight
or
heights
and
weights
of
their
partners
—
that
is
,
the
mother
[SEP]
[CLS]
,
or
heights
and
lengths
of
child
at
age
0
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
It
is
well
known
that
male
heights
tend
to
be
greater
in
reported
than
measured
data
.
37
##O
##ur
analysis
suggests
that
it
is
unlikely
that
correlation
##s
were
affected
by
this
[SEP]
[CLS]
feature
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Probably
the
most
familiar
technique
in
est
##imating
her
##ita
##bility
is
parent
–
offspring
re
##gression
in
which
,
for
example
,
a
trait
'
s
her
##ita
##bility
can
be
estimated
as
the
slope
[SEP]
[CLS]
of
the
re
##gression
of
offspring
p
##hen
##otype
on
mid
-
parent
p
##hen
##otype
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
It
has
been
noted
##36
##tha
##t
if
the
sexes
are
not
equal
in
p
##hen
##otypic
variance
,
then
re
##gression
of
daughters
on
fathers
,
for
example
,
must
be
adjusted
for
the
difference
[SEP]
[CLS]
in
variation
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
adjusted
re
##gression
is
the
correlation
between
the
p
##hen
##otype
##s
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Twice
this
correlation
is
then
defined
to
be
the
her
##ita
##bility
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Thus
,
correlation
##s
between
the
p
##hen
##otype
##s
reported
here
can
be
taken
to
approximate
half
the
her
##ita
##bility
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
addition
,
adjustments
for
multiple
testing
were
made
in
this
model
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Studies
on
children
are
likely
to
be
over

representative
of
individuals
from
more
recent
birth
years
,
but
the
separation
of

co

on

correlation
[SEP]
[CLS]
was
possible
in
this
study
by
including
age

fixed
and
generation

fixed

in
the
model
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Age

g
##eno

are
also
modelled
by
the

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Thus
,
correlation
estimates
obtained
are
comparable
across
co
##hor
##ts
and
age
groups
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Our
data
do
have
limitations
,
as
they
are
based
on
a
relatively
small

scale
co
##hor
##t
with
differential
response
rates
at
each
sweep
and
the
numbers
of
measured
children
[SEP]
[CLS]
at
age
9
was
considerably
lower
than
in
the
previous
sweep
##s
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
We
agree
that
caution
is
appropriate
accordingly
in
data
interpretation
as
the
numbers
at
age
9
are
smaller
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
previous
publications
,
we
have
reported
on
the
representative
##ness
of
the
participating
mothers
and
children
and
find
,
as
with
many
co
##hor
##ts
,
that
less
affluent
and
younger
mothers
[SEP]
[CLS]
were
less
likely
to
continue
to
participate
,
but
the
base

maternal
B

does
not
differ
between
respond

and
non

.
22
##A
##ls
##o
,
we
only
report
statistical
##ly
significant
[SEP]
[CLS]
findings
which
by
definition
are
sufficiently
powered
when
the
child
is
aged
9
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
There
may
be
some
self
-
selection
bias
in
relation
to
participating
grandparents
,
as
clearly
grandparents
who
were
deceased
could
not
participate
.
26
##I
##n
previous
analyses
,
we
have
[SEP]
[CLS]
shown
that
the
original
index
mothers
were
representative
of
the
general
population
,
22
##and
our
findings
were
consistent
across
the
three

so
we
do
not
think
self

can
be
the

for

In

this

shows
clear

across
three

[SEP]
[CLS]
This
study
is
significant
for
at
least
3
reasons
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
First
,
it
provides
a
random
##ized
trial
of
text
##4
##ba
##by
with
a
large
sample
over
the
full
course
of
the
pre
##nat
##al
text
##ing
module
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
Mad
##igan
study
was
ambitious
in
that
it
followed
a
base
##line
sample
of
nearly
1000
women
for
a
total
study
period
of
nearly
2
years
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Second
,
it
provides
one
of
the
most
comprehensive
studies
to
date
evaluating
the
effect
of
m
##H
##eal
##th
on
the
health
of
pregnant
military
female
soldiers
and
family
members
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
As
noted
,
military
women
’
s
health
is
an
under
##st
##udi
##ed
topic
and
the
multiple
stress
##ors
that
they
face
compared
to
civilian
women
suggest
that
it
deserves
greater
attention
from
[SEP]
[CLS]
m
##H
##eal
##th
and
other
health
studies
[
34
,
41
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Third
,
the
study
demonstrates
a
behavioral
effect
of
text
##4
##ba
##by
among
high

exposure
users
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Previous
studies
demonstrated
short

term
effects
on
K
##AB
among
participants
,
including
the
initial
outcomes
of
the
Mad

study
[
23

26
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
until
these
results
,
no
behavioral
effects
had
been
observed
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
We
found
that
among
the
subgroup
of
high

participants
,
text

had
a
positive
effect
on

behavior
of

##tum
women
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Specifically
,
we
disco
##n
##firmed
our
first
hypothesis
that
there
was
no
direct
treatment
effect
of
text

.
[SEP]

The

[SEP]

However
,
we

our
second
hypothesis
that

was

of

[SEP]
[CLS]
This
was
an
important
focus
of
text
##4
##ba
##by
messages
,
including
both
recommendations
not
to
drink
and
also
warnings
about
the
health
risks
of
f
##etal
alcohol
syndrome
for
un
##born
babies
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Our
results
show
that
dos
##age
was
a
predict
##or
of
lower
alcohol
consumption
response
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Although
self
-
reported
alcohol
consumption
would
be
expected
to
be
lower
after
pregnancy
given
social
cues
and
available
information
about
health
risks
for
all
participants
,
the
dose

[SEP]
[CLS]
response
effect
among
text

##ba

participants
was
pronounced
,
as
high
-
dose
participants
were
more
than
twice
as
likely
to
a

##tain

compared
to
low

participants
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
brief
,

intervention
format
of
text
##4
##ba
##by
is
consistent
with
other
brief
pre
##nat
##al
alcohol
interventions
found
to
be
effective
in
recent
studies
[
42
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Moreover
,
descriptive
analysis
showed
that
the
quantity
of
drinking
was
lower
among
text
##4
##ba
##by
participants
post
##par
##tum
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
total
,
there
were
6
messages
related
to
risks
of
alcohol
consumption
,
spread
over
the
intervention
period
,
among
the
pregnancy
messages
delivered
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Although
this
is
not
a
large
number
of
total
messages
,
it
is
worth
noting
that
they
reinforce
information
women
are
already
receiving
from
other
sources
regarding
avoiding
alcohol
use
[SEP]
[CLS]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
These
data
suggest
that

There
are
2
important
limitations
of

[SEP]
[CLS]
First
,
we
had
a
low
follow

up

and
,
thus
,
used
imp
##uta
##tion
techniques
to
support
the
analysis
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
As
a
result
,
the
study
may
be
under
##powered
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Despite
this
fact
,
the
overall
direction
of
results
was
consistent
with
previous
text
##4
##ba
##by
studies
and
additionally
we
found
a
behavioral
effect
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Much
of
the
at
##tri
##tion
was
at
##tri
##but
##able
to
red
##ep
##loy
##ments
and
,
thus
,
lack
of
access
to
participants
at
the
Mad
##igan
clinic
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Second
,
although
we
observed
dos
##age
effects
,
we
are
only
able
to
conclude
that
higher
levels
of
text
messages
had
an
effect
on
alcohol
use
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
leaves
the
important
question
of
exact
dos
##age
and
timing
of
delivery
requirements
for
future
studies
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Studies

Introduction
The
role
of
vitamin
D
in
fertility
treatment
has
been
recently
described
in
some
comprehensive
reports
[

]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Numerous
publications
pro
##claim
this
particle

pan
##ace
##a
for
various
mental
and
so
##matic
chronic
diseases
,
while
other
advise
caution
in
pre
##s
##cribing
it
to
some
groups
of
patients
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
What
is
the
role
of
ch
##ole
##cal
##ci
##fer
##ol
in
human
reproduction
?
[SEP]
[CLS]
Should
its
supplement
##ation
become
a
golden
standard
in
fertility
treatment
,
or
do
we
still
need
more
evidence
on
its
effect
?
[SEP]
[CLS]
Today
we
know
that
,
in
a
healthy
woman
,
vitamin
D
serum
concentration
is
higher
than
in
patients
suffering
from
p
##oly
##cy
##stic
o
##var
##ies
syndrome
(
PC
##OS
)
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Vita

in
patients
with
PC

remain
unknown
,
but

and

Vita

stimulate
##s
anti

Müller
##ian
hormone
(
AM

)
production
as
well
,
which
is
highly
correlated
with
o
##var
##ian
reserve
preservation
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Likewise
,
in
patients
with
vitamin
D
deficiency
,
a
higher
occurrence
of
u
##ter
##ine
my
##oma
##s
is
observed
—
another
established
reason
for
in
##fer
##tility
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Moreover
,
it
was
found
that
a
high
concentration
of
ca
##l
##cid
##iol
is
related
to
greater
end
##ome
##tri

incidence
,
which
was
explained
by
dim

##shing
elimination
of
end

that
pass
to
[SEP]

and

(

vitamin

serum
concentrations
decrease
not

count
but
also
[SEP]
[CLS]
their
progressive

as
well
as

[SEP]
[CLS]
Therefore
,
a
clinic
##ian
must
be
careful
when
pre
##s
##cribing
vitamin
D
preparations
,
especially
in
male
patients
.

,
Vita

was
strongly

Studies
on

[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
the
perspective
is
changing

one

one
in

[SEP]
[CLS]
With
regards
to
waiting
time
at
the
clinic
,
the
women
recognized
that
most
of
the
time
wasting
was
due
to
late
coming
of
their
fellow
pregnant

.
[SEP]

However

with

this

,
especially
for

of

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
They
were
impatient
because
they
claimed
they
had
other
pre

##cup
##ations
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Furthermore
,
respond
##ents
had
some
reservations
with
respect
to
the
sitting
comfort
in
some
health

,
complaining
that
the

were
too
hard
and
lacked
back

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
women
with
high
level
of
education
and
women
attending
for
their
first
pre
##gna
##ncies
were
not
satisfied
with
the
competence
of
the
staff
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Most
of
them
recommended
an
improvement
in
the

skills

[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
women
attending
for
their
subsequent
pre

##ncies
and
those
at
their
third
or
more
visits
were
more
tolerant
of
the
services
provided
at
the
health
centres
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
is
probably
because
their
contact
with
the
health
system
had
tailored
their
expectations
and
they
expressed
satisfaction
with
the
existing
services
.
[SEP]

There

significant

[SEP]
[CLS]
Women
attending
AN

for
their
subsequent
pre
##gna
##ncies
probably
had
a
notion
of
what
health
topics
were
discussed
during
clinic
sessions
and
so
their
objectives
at
AN
##C
were
not
only
aimed
[SEP]
[CLS]
at
acquiring
knowledge
about
diet
,
danger
signs
and
other
topics
but
also
in
the
state

[SEP]

on

expected

[

.
[SEP]

C

with
a

,
were
less

with
the

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
They
were
more
interested
in
having
an
in
##de
##bt
knowledge
on
how
complications
arising
during
pregnancy
could
be
managed
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
predominant
topics
discussed
during
health
talks
were
h
##ygiene
and
nutrition
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
There
were
post

lectures
on
the

breast
##fe

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Focus
##ing
on
post

issues
was
not
usually
appealing
to
pregnant
women
who
were
more
eager
to
learn
about
labor
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
an
Australian
study
showed
that
both
women
and
providers
thought
the
time
for
ant
##ena
##tal
classes
was
too
small
to
incorporate
all
they
had
to
learn
with
some
women
[SEP]
[CLS]
complaining
of
having
received
too
much
information
[
29
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
overall
satisfaction
of
the
women
attending
AN
##C
in
the
study
health
district
was
high
(
91
.
4
%
)
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
These
results
are
similar
to
other
studies
of
patient
satisfaction
;
(
96

5

)
in

4
%
in

[SEP]
[CLS]
State
,
Nigeria
[

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
it
has
been
said
that
the
views
of
pregnant
women
concerning
their
care
is
generally
positive
as
they
tend
to
be
un
##c
##ritic
##al
of
healthcare
,
accepting
whatever
care
[SEP]
[CLS]
they
receive
as
appropriate
[
29
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Thus
using
patient
views
to
evaluate
health
care
has
been
criticized
[
30
]
,
regarding
their
responses
as
a
mixture
of
the
healthcare
performance
measurement
and
the
respond
##ent
'
s
[SEP]
[CLS]
reflection
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Nevertheless
,
patient
views
provide
an
insight
to
the
care
provided
and
the
system
as
a
whole
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
influence
of
the
educational
level
of
respond
##ents
is
predominant
here
as
it
is
noticed
that
those
at
a
high
educational
level
are
more
likely
to
be
critical
about
care
[SEP]
[CLS]
received
and
def
##er
a
positive
satisfaction
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
issue
was
also
revealed
in
F
##aw

and
colleagues
’
study
[

where
they
h
##y
##pot

##ized
that
as
the
level
of

in
the

steadily
increases
,
pregnant
[SEP]
[CLS]
women
may
become
more
and
more
critical
of
health
care
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Hence
there
is
a
need
to
mob
##ilize
efforts
for
a
better
quality
assessment
in
our
health

provision
with
the

Statistical

show
that
one
out

88
individuals
in

[SEP]
[CLS]
The
condition
may
be
defined
as
a
chronic

##mental
disorder
that
first
becomes
prevalent
in
an
individual
during
his

her
early
childhood
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Consequently
,
autism
results
in
a
patient
experiencing
a
life
that
is
marked
by
the
ongoing
challenge
of
its
negative
effects
on
communication
and
interaction
with
others
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
disorder
is
de
##bil
##itating
for
the
patient
and
immensely
challenging
for
his

her
family
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
An
initial
diagnosis
of
autism
occurs
as
an
individual
is
notice
##ably
unable
to
achieve
certain
early
childhood
milestone
##s
in
terms
of
communication
and
social
##ization

Furthermore
,
while
the
incidence
and
the
prevalence
of
autism
also
tend
to
raise
on
an
ever

increasing
basis
,
public
health
concerns
over
the

have
also
been
[SEP]

which

[SEP]

Initial
research
efforts
,
which
were
embarked
upon

assert

complications

the

,
and
the
incidence
of
autism
are
[SEP]
[CLS]
linked
.
[SEP]

Over
the
past
several
decades
,
continuing
research
has
been
conducted
,
and
much
literature
has
been
published
that
has
supported
the

Birth

Many

have
evaluated
the
association
between
birth
weight
and
the
development
of
autism
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
A
significant
four

observed
in

females
for
autism
accompanied

[SEP]
[CLS]
In
low

males
there
was
no
significant

observed
for

alone
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Though
this
implies
a
certain
et

premise
of
difference
in
gender
,
it
is
also
important
to
note
that
while
the
population
co

is
strong
,
there
was
not
[SEP]
[CLS]
a
large
number
overall
of
the
lower

in
females
[

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
An
earlier
study
by
W
##il
##kers

supports
this
finding
as
it
determined
that
birth
weight
was
a

for
the

of
autism

,
with
significant

[SEP]

[SEP]

Specifically
,
it
is
the
prescription

taken
during

,
the
length
of

,
viral

,
abnormal

at

,
and
finally
low

that
were
[SEP]

associated
with

[SEP]

In
this

only

Further
,
several

examined
head

abnormal

in
autism
patients
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Their
studies
suggest
that
the
abnormal
growth
in
children
with
autism
spectrum
disorders
may
be
related
to
the
ca
##usal
factors
that
also
increase
the
risk
for
AS
##D
,
as
it
[SEP]
[CLS]
was
found
that
children
with
AS
##D
had
proportional
##ly
smaller
head
c
##ir
##cum

compared
to

during
their
first

which
was
absent
in
premature

low

[SEP]
[CLS]
children
with
AS
##D
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Even
more
importantly
,
the
body
grew
faster
than
the
head
for
those
with
AS
##D
by
the
end
of
the
first
year
of

,
suggesting
a
closer
following
of
[SEP]
[CLS]
length
to
c
##ir
##cum
##ference
during
development
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
there
may
have
been
some
recall
bias
and
head
c
##ir
##cum
##ference
could
only
be
measured
on
the
first

all
within
a
modest

indicating
[SEP]

a
need
for

in

Because

it

a

these

increases

[SEP]

that
the

[SEP]

While

body
of

also
provides
some
comprehensive
evidence
for
,
and
specific
mechanisms
of
,
e
##pi
##gene
##tic
toxicity
,
it
was
considered
outside
the
scope
of
this

[SEP]
[CLS]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Likewise
,
pharmaceutical
drug
-
induced
e
##pi
##gene
##tic
toxicity
in
human
co
##hor
##ts
and
rode
##nt
models
has
also
been
reported
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
such
drugs
are
not
environmental
factors
and
so
were
not
considered
any
further
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Moreover
,
there
were
additional
studies
that
have
investigated
environmental
##ly
induced
e
##pi
##gene
##tic
changes
without
simultaneously
assessing
any
p
##hen
##otypic

##s
(
less
[SEP]

[SEP]
[CLS]
While
such
studies
are
more
difficult
to
interpret
with
respect
to
e
##pi
##gene
##tic
toxicity
(
and
so
were
not
included
in

,
they
may
still
provide
useful
me

[SEP]

[SEP]
[CLS]
It
is
important
to
note
that
not
all
environmental
##ly

adverse
p
##hen

have
been
associated
with
e
##pi
##gene

[SEP]
[CLS]
Indeed
,
18
human
co

20
rode
##nt
studies
within

reported
a
lack

(

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
These
studies
do
not
necessarily
rule
out
an
e
##pi
##gene
##tic
mechanism
of
toxicity
per
se
,
but
they
do
exclude
a
link
between
the
specific
e

,
exposure
and

or
[SEP]
[CLS]
adverse

In

Subsequent

Much
of
the

[SEP]

[SEP]
[CLS]
Not
only
is
it
unlikely
that
a
human
would
receive
this
,
or
any
,
environmental
exposure
via
the
same
route
of
administration
,
but
also
the
way
in
which
[SEP]
[CLS]
an

is
administered
determines
its
overall

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Indeed
,
oral
administration
of
v
##in
##c

##zo
##lin
to
pregnant

(
the

in

(
Schneider

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Thus
,
while
it
is
important
to
fully
character
##ize
the
hazard
,
further
studies
at
doses
and
routes
of
administration
similar
to
those
found
in
humans
are
necessary
for
determining
[SEP]

relevance
to

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
It
is
worth
noting
,
however
,
that
establishing
the
actual
level
of
human
exposure
to
a
particular
factor
and
mimic
##king
it
in
experimental

is
not
always
easy
.
[SEP]

Met

is
another

[SEP]
[CLS]
Thus
,
metabolism
of
the

can
vary
greatly
between
models
,
resulting
in
the
production
of
different

[SEP]

It
is
,
therefore
,
important
to

using

[SEP]
[CLS]
The
timing
of
an
environmental
exposure
can
also
be
a
major
contributing
factor
to
the
significance
of
the
overall
outcome
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
As
discussed
earlier
,
some
life
stages
may
be
more
susceptible
than
others
to
a
particular
exposure
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
There
was
the
assumption
that
in
u

exposure
represents
the
most
vulnerable
period
in
an
individual

life
with
respect
to
their

[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
it
is
now
becoming

that
pre

post

##s
can
also
be
de

across

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Finally
,
humans
are
continuously
exposed
to
a

of
different
environmental

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Multiple

##s
at
multiple

could

[SEP]
[CLS]
While
a

may
have
no

,
multiple

exposure
##s
over
multiple

may
induce

[SEP]

once

Such

Despite

[SEP]

This
might

since
the
fundamental

that

can
induce
p

across
multiple

challenges
the

of

,
moving

a

,

[SEP]

While
many
hundreds

have
investigated
environmental

,
relatively
few
(

they
do

and
provide

that

Returning
to

weight

Thus
,
the

be

In

the

One
possibility

that

either
a

A

the

on

but
also

[SEP]
[CLS]
A
major
issue
in
sex
differences
is
the
need
for
control
the
est

on
which
the

##s

performed
in
order
to
c
##lar
##ify
the
impact
of

variations
[SEP]
[CLS]
in
the
female

[SEP]
[CLS]
Since
the
number
of
animals
needed
to
control
the
three
phases
of
the
est
##rous
cycle
,
including
morning
to
afternoon

variations
,
was
too
high
to
be

,
[SEP]
[CLS]
we
had
to
use
randomly
cycling
female

sacrificed
only

the

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
limitation
has
to
be
considered
in
the
interpretation
of
the

further

will
be
addressed
to
evaluate
the
reasons

However
,
it
is
important
to
note

both

so
a

will
also
involve
the

Con

As

,
our

demonstrated
that
the

to
a
moderate

from
the
pre

pre

##posed
for
the

of

,
affected
sub

the

and
altered
the
gene

of
relevant

of
the

and

,
including

of

manner
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Moreover
,
the
outcomes
of
the
present
study
enhance
the
importance
of
the
per
##ico
##nce
##ption
##al
period
as
well
as
the
role
of
maternal
diet
in
the
early
life
programming
,
due
[SEP]
[CLS]
to
the
fact
that
the
maternal
under
##nut
##rit
##ion
was
implemented
before
mating
and
offspring
were
raised
in
an
ad
l
##ibi
##tum
standard

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Important
##ly
,
this
evidence
supports
the
idea
that
the
contribution
of
the
end
##oc
##anna
##bino
##id
system
in
the
early
life
programming
could
be
critical
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Our
findings
represent
an
important
key
point
to
understand
the
complexity
of
the

One

is
the
use

[SEP]

The

vary

[SEP]

There

[SEP]
[CLS]
Thus
,
significant
correlation
between
lower

and
low

found

The
reason

an

,
in

the

the

Recent

Because

Third
,
a

[

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Furthermore
,
the
measurement
of

relies
on
both
the

the

Although
this

is
relatively
non

and
easy
to
perform
,
there
is
limited
evidence
showing
that
the
R

sensitive
enough
to
distinguish
between
different

of

[SEP]

.
[SEP]

Therefore
,
defining
the

relationship
between
R

and
clinical

in
infants
with

is
difficult

the

the

the

were
generally
sub

in
our
study
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Although
poor
lung
function
performance
and
an
increased
risk
of
respiratory
tract
infection
were
related
to
relatively
low

serum
vitamin

,
further
extra
##pol

the
effects
of

[SEP]
[CLS]
D
on
the
respiratory

of
the
general
infant
population
might
still
be
difficult
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
conclusion
,
this
study
is
the
first
to
reveal
that
infants
with
low
cord
serum
25
(
OH

D
levels
have
poor

lung

at
6
months
of

age
compared

those

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
They
also
have
a
higher
risk
of
a
respiratory

infection
before
this
age
.
[SEP]

Although
cord
vitamin
D
levels
are
strongly
correlated
with
maternal

levels
,
the
extent
of
the
impact
on
later
respiratory

is
distinctive
.
[SEP]

We

that
this

provides
a

of
the

With
the

were
at
44

lower

risk
of

than

In

Indeed

[SEP]

The

tested

consisted
of

”
There
was
no

and
thus
,
it
is
not
clear
whether
the

A
barrier

.

In
2013
,
the
in

##cin

recommendation
was
extended
to
all
pregnant
women
in
the
Municipality
of
Man
##agu
##a
,
and
in
2014
,
the
Government
of
Nicaragua
extended
in
##fluenza
v
##ac
##cin
##ation
[SEP]
[CLS]
to
all
pregnant
women
in
the
country
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
little
is
known
about
how
well
the
recommendations
were
implemented
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Indeed
,
vaccine
up
##take
remained
somewhat
higher
among
pregnant
women
with
pre
-
existing
chronic
medical
conditions
in
our
study
year
suggesting
that
the
recommendation
may
have
been
slow
to
[SEP]
[CLS]
take
effect
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Higher
v
##ac
##cin
##ation
among
pregnant
women
with
high
-
risk
pre
##gna
##ncies
could
have
caused
a
selection
bias
as
those
v
##ac
##cin
##ated
women
would
have
been
at
higher
risk
for
adverse
pregnancy
outcomes
[SEP]
[CLS]
compared
to
un
##va
##cci
##nated
women
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Second
,
the
sample
was
not
randomly
selected
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Women
who
agreed
to
participate
in
the
study
could
have
been
different
from
women
who
did
not
participate
in
the
study
,
and
we
did
not
collect
characteristics
on
women
[SEP]
[CLS]
who
refused
to
participate
in
the
study
to
as
##cer
##tain
this
bias
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Third
,
we
did
not
power
the
sample
size
to
analyze
effects
by
trim
##ester
of
v
##ac
##cin
##ation
and
so
may
have
missed
important
effects
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Fourth
,
we
based
our
calculation
of
g
##esta
##tional
age
at
delivery
on
L
##MP
which
is
known
to
be
subject
to
recall
bias
and
could
have
introduced
errors
in
our
calculations
[SEP]
[CLS]
[
53
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
when
L
##MP
was
determined
to
be
unreliable
,
we
calculated
g
##esta
##tional
age
at
delivery
using
data
from
an
ultra
##sound
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Approximately
6
%
of
the
g
##esta
##tional
age
estimates
came
from
ultra
##sound
##s
in
the
last
trim
##ester
,
which
have
higher
rates
of
estimate
error
than
estimates
calculated
in
early
pregnancy
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Finally
,
we
were
not
able
to
obtain
information
on
previous
pregnancy
outcomes
;
previous
history
of
PT
##B
or
abortion
in
the
second
trim
##ester
has
been
associated
with
an
increased
[SEP]
[CLS]
frequency
of
PT
##B
[
54
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Despite
these
limitations
,
the
strengths
of
our
study
include
having
access
to
birth
outcomes
from
medical
records
as
well
as
having
available
in
##fluenza
surveillance
data
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Studies
suggest
that
the
effect
of
in
##fluenza
v
##ac
##cin
##ation
on
birth
outcomes
may
be
better
observed
during
high
in
##fluenza
circulation
period
,
and
there
was
a
substantial
in
##fluenza
circulation
in
Nicaragua
[SEP]
[CLS]
in
2014
[
20
]
,
[
21
]
,
[
55
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Furthermore
,
the
prop
##ens
##ity
score
analyses
minimize
##d
bias
##es
introduced
by
differences
in
base
##line
characteristics
between
un
##va
##cci
##nated
and
v
##ac
##cin
##ated
pregnant
women
by
accounting
for
the
probability
of
v
##ac
##cin
##ation
based
on
these
[SEP]
[CLS]
characteristics
[
43
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
We
were
also
able
to
perform
sensitivity
analysis
for
self
-
reported
v
##ac
##cin
##ation
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Moreover
,
we
used
international
standards
to
define
the
variable
small
for
g

##tional
age
[

and
valid
##ated

;
results
were
consistent
for
both
(
data
not
shown

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
summary
,
we
found
some
evidence
of
a
protective
effect
of
in
##fluenza
v
##ac
##cin
##ation
by
trim

on

it

a

more

[SEP]

A
limitation
of
this

was
that
nearly
two

of
the

(
63

)
had
only
one
25

,
which
[SEP]
[CLS]
prohibited
assessment
by

and
a
more
thorough
analysis
of
vitamin
D
benefit
among
those
with
low
initial

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
is
due
to
follow

up
testing
being
on
the
recommended
test
order
set
but
still
needing
provider
selection
compared
to
the
initial

which
is
automated
as
part
[SEP]
[CLS]
of
the
initial
pre
##nat
##al
screening
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Additionally
,
the
initial
test
was
not
automated
until
May
2016
so
many
women
who
delivered
during
the
early
study
time
period
did
not
have
a
25

OH

[SEP]
[CLS]
D
measurement
and
therefore
could
not
be
included
in
this
analysis
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Since
this
new
standard
of

was
implemented
in
September
2015
,
there
have
been
ongoing
improvements
in
automation
,

support
the

The

Due

the

and
the

it

seem
p

to
hypothesis

that
seasonal

In

We
hypothesis

that

The
lack

that

We

whether

childhood
atop

atop

as

We

that

is
unlikely
,

we

,

[SEP]

Important
##ly
,
the

were
not

[SEP]

While
the

,
the

[SEP]
[CLS]
As
with
any
longitudinal
study
,
we
cannot
rule
out
the
possibility
that
exclusion
of
mother
–
child
pairs
without
complete
information
might
have
bias
##ed
our
findings
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
it
could
be
argued
that
,
for
our
results
to
be
totally
spur
##ious
in
those
included
in
our
analysis
(
and
for
the
associations
to
be
truly
null
[SEP]
[CLS]
in
the
population
as
a
whole
)
,
associations
in
the
excluded
mother
–
child
pairs
would
have
to
be
in
the
opposite
direction
and
much
stronger
,
compared
with
the
[SEP]
[CLS]
positive
associations
we
reported
in
the
included
mother
–
child
pairs
,
which
seems
extremely
unlikely
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Furthermore
,
loss
to
follow
-
up
bias
has
been
shown
to
only
slightly
modify
associations
in
longitudinal
studies
,
including
in
AL
##SP
##AC
[
49
]
,
and
the
results
of
[SEP]
[CLS]
our
inverse
probability
weight
##ing
analysis
[
35
]
confirmed
that
loss
to
follow
-
up
is
unlikely
to
have
bias
##ed
our
results
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
view
of
the
multiple
analyses
carried
out
and
the
post
ho
##c
nature
of
the
findings
for
atop
##ic
as
##th
##ma
,
we
cannot
exclude
the
possibility
that
the
main
findings
occurred
[SEP]
[CLS]
by
chance
;
hence
,
they
should
be
interpreted
with
caution
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Given
the
a
prior
##i
nature
of
the
hypothesis
being
tested
,
and
the
fact
that
some
outcomes
of
interest
are
highly
correlated
,
it
did
not
seem
appropriate
to
correct
[SEP]
[CLS]
for
multiple
testing
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
we
plan
to
re
-
examine
this
hypothesis
in
another
birth
co
##hor
##t
to
see
if
we
can
replica
##te
the
main

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Con
##c
##lusion
##s
and
public
health
implications
We
conclude
that
a
higher
maternal
intake
of
free
sugar
during
pregnancy
may
increase
the
risk
of
atop
##y
and
atop
##ic
as
##th
##ma
in
the
offspring
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
If
these
findings
are
replica

we
would
design
an
appropriate
intervention

in

to
establish

[SEP]

Given
the

consumption
currently

where

,
confirmation
of

would

There
are
a

[SEP]
[CLS]
First
,
due

made

we

[SEP]
[CLS]
As
such
,
confirmation
of
these

in

is
needed
as
it
is
possible
that
women

[SEP]

Second
,
we
did
not

in

(

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
may
reflect
the
lower

,
although
our

are
similar
to
other
small

(
10

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Furthermore
,
in

,
we
performed
analysis
only
of

previously

to
be

with

[SEP]

However
,
it
is

that
alternate

be

in

and
could
be

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
conclusion
,
common
genetic
variation
is
associated
with
base

the

examined

These

[SEP]

One
way
to

to
collapse

a
summary

calculating

Both

The

has
advantages
compared
with
other
anal

techniques
including
LA

and
El

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
First
,
each

between

to

chemicals
with

between
any

chemical
and

Having

the
interpretation
of
associations
between
the
5
E
##DC
classes
and
birth
weight
when
using
traditional
multi

linear
methods
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
B
##HL
##M
examines
the
average
effect
of
E
##DC
exposure
on
birth
weight
at
the
class
level
using
the
parameter
μ
##β
,
which
is
less
susceptible
to
random
variation
[
[SEP]
[CLS]

]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
A
second
advantage
of
reporting
μ
##β
##is
that
it
prevents
the
investigator
from
only
reporting
chemicals
that
are
significantly
related
to
birth
weight
by
virtue
of
it
being
an
average
association
[SEP]
[CLS]
between
a

and
the

[SEP]
[CLS]
For
example
,
rather
than
sorting
through
23
PC
##B
##s
to
identify
those
that
are
significant
,
we
simply
reported
the

[SEP]

A
final
advantage

is
that
posterior

s

There
were
several
limitations
to
the
study
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
First
,
the
B

did
not
account
for
interactions
between

and
we
assumed
that
all
chemicals
within
a

share
a
similar
mode
of
action
and
arise
[SEP]
[CLS]
from
a
common
prior
distribution
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Second
,
the
model
also
excluded
non

linear
relationships
,
including
potential
threshold
effects
that
could
yield
important
information
about
the
relationships
between
E
##DC
exposure
and
birth
weight
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Third
,
B
##HL
##M
results
are
sensitive
to
the
assigned
prior
distributions
of
h
##yper
##par
##ame

μ
##β

[

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
B
##HL
##M
,
because
it

a
shrink

also
prone
to

[SEP]
[CLS]
We

Fourth
,

[SEP]

of

A
strength
of
the

in
the

[SEP]
[CLS]
A
challenge
in
previous
studies
on
vitamin

has
been
the
lack
of

for

adjustments

[SEP]

In

we
have
systematically

between

and
adjusted

those

[SEP]

The
threshold
for
defining
vitamin

the

vary
between

which
might
affect
the

and
com
##plicate
the

of

[SEP]
[CLS]
A
further
limitation
is
that
the
O
##G
##TT
was
not
performed
on
all
mothers
,
and
a
slight
possibility
exists
that
the

Both
these

relatively

the

A
limitation
of
this

is
that
information
on

I

[SEP]

Survival

[SEP]
[CLS]
Since
there
were
few
cases

the

used
in

was
based
on

Among

only

Therefore
,
the

used

Another
limitation
is
that

Earlier

shown
that

However
,
due
to
a
wide
range
of
nut

,
maternal

should
be
explored
to
achieve

Diet
##ary

are

Limited

So

the

[SEP]

This
might
be
a
reason
why
we

,
which
has
been
shown
to
be

[SEP]
[CLS]
Iranian
usual

also
contains
high

of
salt

which
means
that
salt

almost
two

the

[SEP]

In

,
understanding

Another
point
that
needs
to
be

the

[SEP]
[CLS]
Lac
##k
of

an
issue
in

[SEP]
[CLS]
In
this
regard
,
in

should
be
identified
on
the
basis
of
measures
of
f

,
rather
than

[

[SEP]

In

,
residual
con

due

not
be
excluded
,
although
we
controlled
some
important
potential
con

[SEP]

Therefore
,
these
potential
limitations
should
be
considered
in
the
interpretation

[SEP]

However
,
the
main
strengths
of
the
current

include

[SEP]

Another
positive
point
is
that
few

[SEP]

In

,

Background
With

of

and
ins

##iciency
reported
both
in
Australia
and
New

,
as
well
as
worldwide
[

]
,
there
is
continuing
interest
[SEP]
[CLS]
in
determining
how
vitamin
D
deficiency
may
influence
health
in
pregnancy
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Evidence
suggests
that
vitamin
D
deficiency
is
associated
with
a
number
of
pregnancy
complications
including

However

reflect
uncertainty
about
the
true
effect
of
vitamin
D
deficiency
on
pregnancy
outcome
[

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
may
be
explained
,
in

,
by
inadequate

There

that

is

Previous

,
are
known
to
affect

D

and
therefore
influence
study
outcomes
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Furthermore
,
the
g

at
which
vitamin

measured
is
also
important

[

.
[SEP]

However
,
measuring

in

is
common
and
potentially
clinical

as

found
that

Iron

deficiency
is
the
most

nutrition

globally
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Due
to
the
high
iron
requirements
for

,
it
is
highly
prevalent
and
severe
in
pregnant
women
[

.
[SEP]

42

[SEP]

However
,
the

[SEP]
[CLS]
The
first

The

suggest
a

For

,
the

the

One
mechanism
the
infant
gut
micro
##bio

may
be
affected
by

is
via

To

however
,
South

public

for

women
are
limited
to
f

,
while
it
is
highly

that
[SEP]

the

is
lacking
vital

[SEP]

To
the
best
of
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
South

study
focusing
on
the
assessment
of
both
maternal
diet

intake
and
nutrition
##al
status
in
women
pre

[SEP]
[CLS]
and
post

##ally
and
to
investigate
associations
with
outcomes
of
maternal
and
infant
health
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
study
is
novel
due
to
the
comprehensive
set
of
nutrition
related
data
and
indicators
of
maternal
and
infant
health
being
obtained
in
a
South
African
setting
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Therefore
,
this
ex
##p
##lora
##tive
project
will
contribute
to
identifying
factors
that
may
be
targeted
in
future
pre

maternal
interventions
for

and

risk
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
study
also
has
its
challenges
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
inclusion
and
exclusion
criteria
for
participants
were
designed
as
such
to
obtain
a
sample
of
generally
healthy
women
,
who
are
able
to
speak
the
local
language
and
who
[SEP]
[CLS]
could
be
followed
-
up
from
early
pregnancy
until
the
infants
are
12
months
old
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
South
African
statistics
show
that
only
52
%
of
women
attend
ant
##ena
##tal
care
before
20
weeks
’
g
##esta
##tion
[
30
]
,
thus
access
to
women
early
in
pregnancy
is
restricted
[SEP]
[CLS]
and
limits
en
##rol
##ment
into
the
study
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Furthermore
,
many
healthcare
facilities
in
Johannesburg
serve
a
predominantly
migrant
population
[
81
]
posing
a
challenge
for
longitudinal
data
collection
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Additionally
,
these
women
may
choose
to
eat
traditional
foods
[
82
]
that
do
not
form
part
of
the
South
African
Food
Database
for
nutrition
##al
analysis
;
and
may
[SEP]
[CLS]
not
be
able
to
speak
a
local
language
[
83
]
ha
##mper
##ing
detailed
reporting
during
diet
##ary
assessments
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Thus
,
mi
##grating
women
or
those
unable
to
speak
local
languages
could
not
be
included
in
the
study
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
A
limitation
of
the
study
is
that
women
who
fit
the
inclusion
criteria
are
invited
to
join
the
study
by
visiting
the
data
collection
site
at
an
agreed
date
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Having
this
option
of
attending
may
contribute
to
self
-
selection
bias
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Our
recruitment
data
to
date
indicate
that
of
those
invited
to
take
part
in
the
study
;
only
approximately
50
%
arrive
at
the
data
collection
site
on
the
booked
[SEP]
[CLS]
date
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Even
so
,
this
study
will
provide
a
comprehensive
and
unique
database
from
an
urban
South
African
setting
which
will
allow
for
cross
-
section
##al
,
prospective
and
retrospective
analyses
[SEP]
[CLS]
to
describe
the
nutrition
##al
status
and
diet
##ary
intake
of
pregnant
women
,
and
to
determine
associations
with
health
outcome
measures
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
These
results
will
supply
context
to
intervention
studies
with
the
aim
to
improve
maternal
as
well
as
offspring
health
in
South
Africa
.
