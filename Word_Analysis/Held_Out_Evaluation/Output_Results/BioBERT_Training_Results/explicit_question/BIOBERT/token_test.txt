,
we
offer
the
following
observations
regarding
the
scope
of

and
limitations
of
the

applied
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
primary
objective
of
a
quantitative
meta

is
to
combine
the
results
of
previous
studies
examining
a
specific
research
question
to
arrive
at
a
summary
conclusion
about
a
[SEP]
[CLS]
body
of
research
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
statistical
pool
##ing
of
several
studies
,
taking
into
account
the
size
of

,
con

more
power

[SEP]

are

[SEP]
[CLS]
It
cannot
,
however
,
correct
for
potential
bias
and
con
##found

of
the
studies
included
;
we
addressed
this
issue
in
our
review
(
Martin

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
2008
)
by
rating
the
quality
of
individual
studies
and
carrying
out
a
sensitivity
analysis
by
excluding
studies
for
which
the
quality
score
was
below
a
chosen
value
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
method
also
requires
that
included
studies
report
a
measure
of
association
such
as
a
risk
ratio
or
odds
ratio
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
For
this
reason
—
although
we
did
mention
impaired
sperm
##ato
##genesis
as
one
of
the
end
points
encompassed
by
the
test
##icular
d
##ys
##genesis
syndrome
—
it
was
necessary
to
exclude
this
end
[SEP]
[CLS]
point
from
our
analysis
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
previous
work
and
a
s
##co
##ping
study
,
we
found
that
most
of
the
research
carried
out
in
relation
to
impaired
sperm
##ato
##genesis
had
investigated
time
trends
rather
than
association
with
[SEP]
[CLS]
specific
risk
factors
(
Martin
et

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
2007
)
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Further
,
our
analysis
was
limited
to
pre
##nat
##al
exposure
to
est
##rogen
##ic
agents
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
A
number
of
studies
have
found
associations
between
sperm

or
sperm

with
levels
of
est

It
would
not

however
to

This
also

the

The
key
factor
which
results
in
the

appears
to
be
a
failure

##As
the

greatest

G

usually
develops
going

,
screening
for
G

usually
occurs
around
24

However
,
one

merits
discussion

[SEP]

Because
of
changes
in
the

over

Be

was
able

examine

who
would
have
been

[SEP]

as
having
G

by
contemporary
criteria

but
were
not
considered
to
have
G

at
the
time
,
and
were
therefore
un
##tre

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
per

rate
was
2

6

in
these

in

to

7

in

[SEP]

after

been

for

[SEP]

In

their

[SEP]

It
therefore
seems
likely
that
the
decreased

at

in

a

In

because

Several

Not
only
do
such

promote

but
eating

also
often
leads
to
over

do
not

This

,
when
the

This

the

:

there
is

to
support
that
a

that

protect

This
indicates
that
there
may
be
a
window

Vita

Our

must
be
considered
as
rough
,
since
we
only
measure
the

A

complete
[SEP]

picture
of
the

could
have
been
supplied
through

however
,
no

are

[SEP]

The
absorption
of
diet
##ary
vitamin

is
generally
high

due
[SEP]

to

Thus
,
the
correlation

may
vary

Our

However
,
the

is

the

farming

On

[SEP]

,
the

in

recently
asked
,
‘
What
if

a

’
(

Since

[SEP]

in
Act
##a

(

and
the

have
added
to

suspicion
that
vitamin

–
either
during

–
may
be
an
environmental

for
the
genetic

[SEP]
[CLS]
I
will
not
repeat
the
evidence
from
my

2007
paper

I
am
well

that

[SEP]

Instead
,
I
concentrate
on

on

I
overlooked
when
researching
the
original

.
[SEP]

Finally
,
I
explain
my
reasons
why
this
theory
deserves
immediate

Si

with

Act

reported
that
among

,
the
10
patients
with

had
the

[SEP]

Even
more

,
some
of

seemed
to

an

about
4000

[SEP]

The

did
not

if
the

occurred
in

[SEP]

A

the

in

[SEP]

For

the

[SEP]
[CLS]
If
adequate

of

prevent

,
one
would
expect
children

[SEP]

To
my

,
the

have
not
been
studied
in

[SEP]

However
,
at

two
old

have
addressed
it
(
10

,
both
published
before
Ka

Even
more
intriguing
,
both

report
that
the

improved
with

Another
of
the
mysteries
of

the

this

[SEP]
[CLS]
As
I
discussed
in
my
original

,
this
has
been
known
since
the
early
1980s

was

which

[SEP]

If
the

is
true
,
autism
should
be
more
common
in
rich

,
who
are

If

we

a

Another

that
air

Indeed
,
without

suspect

the

–
and
perhaps

if

there

Additional

Therefore
,
no
special

is
required
during

On
the

,
the
diet
should
be
well

consist

as
many

the

However
,
if
the

As
mentioned
previously

for

,
there
is
insufficient
evidence

determine
whether
it
is
more
protective
against
all

and
as

than
bottle
[SEP]
[CLS]
feeding
because
in
a

prolonged

breast

could
not
decrease
the
rate

or
as

in

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Furthermore
,
there
are
data
supporting
that
breast

should
not
be
continued
beyond
9

of

because
doing

Some

investigated
the
effect
of
reduced

of

all

.
[SEP]

In

,
this

was
short

was
primarily

[SEP]
[CLS]
As
a
further
prevent

measure
,
the
early
introduction
of

(

into

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
contact
with

exposure

be
necessary
in

This

The

A

for
the

and
the
broader

and
a

[SEP]

Therefore
these
costs
need
to
be
incorporated
into
the
overall
cost
of
an

We

the

This
compares
to
estimates
by

there

The

reported

includes

[SEP]

The
possible
reasons
for
the
higher
up
##take
of
the
weekly

are
many
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
One
likely
reason
for
the
difference
is
convenience
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
An

Weekly

##s
for
women
of
reproductive

in
the
program
reported
here
are
accessed
at
village
level

[SEP]
[CLS]
The
2009
survey
identified
that
it
took
women
an
average
of
17
minutes
to
access
the
distribution
point
for
weekly
supplement
##s
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Another
reason
for
high
compliance
with
the
weekly
program
was
the
maintenance
of
a
reliable
supply
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
A
previous
study
has
shown
that
a
poor
distribution
system
and
irregular
availability
were
the
most
significant
environmental
risk
factors
for
taking
iron
supplement
##ation
continuously
[

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Also
,
weekly
supplement
##s
may
be
better
tolerate
##d
,
with
less
frequent
side
-
effects
thereby
increasing
acceptance
and
compliance
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
extensive
training
and
community
education
program
was
another
positive
factor
which
increased
acceptance
of
the
supplement
##s
as
a
valuable
contribution
to
women
'
s
health
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
main
limitation
of
the

was
the
lack
of
a
control

where
no

was
given
.

They

[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
it
is
likely
that
by
three

vitamin

has
a
key

in
calcium

in

Whether
the

the

[SEP]

that

are
low

[SEP]

Furthermore
,
there
is
a
seasonal

D

although
we
did
not
have
enough
subjects
to
identify
the
degree
to
which
this
seasonal

[SEP]

was
affected
by

We

it

PT

##he
mechanism

attach

known
as

[SEP]
[CLS]
to

.
This
leads
to
the
transcription
of
a

,
which
results
in
the
translation
of
several

calcium
channels
and
the

[SEP]

attached

was
not

[SEP]

Thus
,
it
is
unclear
whether

directly
or
indirectly
by

Nevertheless
,
the

are
in

to
a

,
it
is
possible
that
this

may
be
due
to
the
lack
of

such
as

Further

this

is
warrant
##ed
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
To
our
knowledge
,
the
present

is
the
first
to
show
a
significant

between
maternal

an
elevated

The
25

found
in

[SEP]

although
only

Our

also
suggest
that
p

be
associated
with

[SEP]

Such

may
have
important
clinical

,
as
the

were
at

twice

The

The

[SEP]
[CLS]
There
are
a
number
of
limitations
inherent
in
the
design
of
the
present

that
should
be
acknowledged
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Given
the
small
sample

,
un

were
used
in
most
of
the

[SEP]

Therefore
,
we

unable
to
fully

the

in
S
##GA
mon
##otherapy
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Such
results
should
be
further
investigated
in
future

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Another
limitation
is
the
inability
to
address
con
##found

by

and
separate
the
relative
effects
of
maternal
mental

from

p

on

[SEP]
[CLS]
Moreover
,
a
more
detailed
investigation
into
maternal
mental
health
,
which
includes
measures
of
the
frequency
and
severity
of
specific
psychiatric
symptoms
during

,
would
allow
for
a
[SEP]
[CLS]
more
thorough
investigation
into
these
critical

variables
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Furthermore
,
evaluating
the
social
characteristics
of
the

co

##t
would
enable
us
to
identify
potential
con
##found
##ing
variables
that
may
affect
pregnancy
outcomes
,
such
as
socio
##economic
status
and
lifestyle
[SEP]
[CLS]
differences
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
women
who
contacted
Mother

tended
to
be
middle
to
upper

middle

,
which
represents
the
majority
of
the

,
and
may
be
higher
functioning
than
those
[SEP]

who
did
not
,
as
they
independently
sought
access
to

in

to
help
educate
themselves
on
the
potential
te

risks
associated
with
their

.
16
##A
smaller
proportion
[SEP]
[CLS]
of
caller
##s
came
from
the
lower
socio
##economic
and
/
or
immigrant
population
;
however
,
this
may
not
affect
the
general
##isa

of
the
results
,
as
their
outcomes
may
be
[SEP]
[CLS]
con

by
other

unrelated
to

[SEP]

Although

there
are
potential
limitations
in

In

it
appears
that
ps

since
advancing

is
a

The

In

we

a

##s
between

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
model
allows
all
data
from
incomplete
families
to
be
used
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
A
linear
mixed

model
analysis
is
adopted
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Each
individual
has
a
family
id
and
within
a
family
individuals
are
also
numbered
according
to
the
group
to
which
they
belong
:
child

,
mother

[SEP]

P
##GM

##G
##F
=

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
unit
in
the
model
is
the
family
member
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
mixed
model
includes
group
,
age
and
group
Χ
age
of
the
family
member
as
fixed
effects
and
a
random
family
effect
with
an
un

correlation
matrix
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Note
:
in
the
case
of
the
child
,
age
represents
the
exact
age
when
measurements
were
made
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
E
##st
##imate
##s
of
this
correlation
matrix
are
obtained
providing
estimates
of

between
the
different

,
that
is
,
child
with
mother
,
child
with
father
and
so
on
,
[SEP]
[CLS]
together
with
p
values
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
These
correlation
##s
measure
the
degree
of
association
between
the
p
##hen
##otypic
values
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
p
value
of
each
correlation
(
or
equivalent
##ly
the
SE
of
the
correlation
)
is
adjusted
for
the
est
##imation
of
the
other
correlation
coefficients
and
the
fixed
effects
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
fixed
effects
are
chosen
to
account
for
different
mean
levels
of
B
##MI
for
the
sexes
and
for
different
generations
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
maternal
and
paternal
grandparents
had
separate
fixed
effects
,
that
is
,
a
different
effect
for
the
MGM
than
the
P
##GM
and
a
different
effect
for
the
MG
##F
than
[SEP]
[CLS]
the
P
##G
##F
as
the
populations
were
not
balanced
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
estimates
are
examined
for
patterns
by
sex
and
by
generation
across
families
so
that
possible
causes
may
be
in
##ferred
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
is
carried
out
at
each
age
point
of
the
index
child
—
at
birth
and
at
ages
5
and
9
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
an
analysis
of
change
between
the
different
ages
,
differences
in
B
##MI
for
different
age
groups
are
calculated
and
re

##ressed
on
the
B
##MI
of
each

the
other

[SEP]

members
in

The

##I
##n
this

,
it
can
be
argued
that
effects
[SEP]

on
B

common
to
both
ages
are
cancelled
and
what
remains
are
differential
genetic

In

has
extended
this

[SEP]

Similar

were
seen
across
the
generations
for
B
##MI
and

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
our
original
publication
,
we
used
examination
data
at
one

point
only
for
the
children
when
they
were
aged
5
;
we
now
report
examination

at
three
[SEP]

separate

,
including
a
completely
new
sweep
of

when

were

[SEP]

It
cannot
be
assumed
that
in
a
growing
child
these
relationships
with
family
members
would
remain
consistently
the
same
,
in
that
environmental
factors
would
come
more
into
play
as
[SEP]
[CLS]
the

grows
up
.
29
##As
children
grow
older
in
this

,
the
B

strengthen

presumably
because

shared

to
reinforce
this

[SEP]

both

also

[SEP]
[CLS]
This
is
therefore
a
novel
analysis
and
a
considerable
expansion
on
the
previous
one

this

[SEP]

Not

is
this
now
more
robust

also
it
is
a
substantial

using

the

not

due

[SEP]

B

receive
their

[SEP]

from

[SEP]
[CLS]
The

the

this

[SEP]
[CLS]
the
degree
to
which
the

might
be
contributing
to

.
34
##U
##n
##like
other
authors
,
35
##we
did
not
find
her
##ita
##bility
for
post
##nat
##al
length
to
be
higher
for
[SEP]
[CLS]
maternal
height
than
for
paternal
height
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
our
analysis
,
it
was
found
that
the
child
’
s
height
was
correlated
with
that
of
all
family
members
at
age
5
,
suggesting
perhaps
many
genetic
effects
[SEP]
[CLS]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Thus
,
the
common
estimate
of
her
##ita
##bility
assuming
add
##itive
genetic
effects
may
not
work
for
height
.
36
##H
##ow
##ever
,
at
ages
0
and
9
,
height
was
primarily
correlated
in
[SEP]

nuclear
family
and
similar
correlation
##s
were
observed
for
the
parents
with
the
grandparents
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Interest
##ingly
,
the
height
of
the
child
continued
at
ages
5
and
9
to
be
strongly
correlated
with
that
of
the
P
##G
##F
,
not
easily
explain
##able
by
conventional
genetic
inheritance
[SEP]
[CLS]
,
though
there
may
be
a
Y
-
related
influence
at
play
through
the
father
,
who
himself
is
highly
correlated
with
his
father
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
There
was
a
systematic
and
statistical
##ly
significant
difference
in
the
height
of
the
two
groups
of
fathers
—
those
reported
were
significantly
taller
than
those
measured
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
may
be
because
reported
data
were
exaggerated
by
the
partner
or
because
,
for
some
reason
,
reported
is
a
health
##ier
group
than
measured
height
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
For
the
small
numbers
of
fathers
we
measured
,
there
was
a
significantly
lower
height
than
in
those
we
reported
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
the
latter
explanation
is
less
likely
since
the
two
groups
do
not
differ
in
weight
or
heights
and
weights
of
their
partners
—
that
is
,
the
mother
[SEP]
[CLS]
,
or
heights
and
lengths
of
child
at
age
0
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
It
is
well
known
that
male
heights
tend
to
be
greater
in
reported
than
measured
data
.
37
##O
##ur
analysis
suggests
that
it
is
unlikely
that
correlation
##s
were
affected
by
this
[SEP]
[CLS]
feature
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Probably
the
most
familiar
technique
in
est
##imating
her
##ita
##bility
is
parent
–
offspring
re
##gression
in
which
,
for
example
,
a
trait
'
s
her
##ita
##bility
can
be
estimated
as
the
slope
[SEP]
[CLS]
of
the
re
##gression
of
offspring
p
##hen
##otype
on
mid
-
parent
p
##hen
##otype
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
It
has
been
noted
##36
##tha
##t
if
the
sexes
are
not
equal
in
p
##hen
##otypic
variance
,
then
re
##gression
of
daughters
on
fathers
,
for
example
,
must
be
adjusted
for
the
difference
[SEP]
[CLS]
in
variation
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
adjusted
re
##gression
is
the
correlation
between
the
p
##hen
##otype
##s
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Twice
this
correlation
is
then
defined
to
be
the
her
##ita
##bility
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Thus
,
correlation
##s
between
the
p
##hen
##otype
##s
reported
here
can
be
taken
to
approximate
half
the
her
##ita
##bility
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
addition
,
adjustments
for
multiple
testing
were
made
in
this
model
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Studies
on
children
are
likely
to
be
over
-
representative
of
individuals
from
more
recent
birth
years
,
but
the
separation
of
birth
co
##hor
##t
and
age
effects
on
B
##MI
correlation
[SEP]
[CLS]
was
possible
in
this
study
by
including
age
-
fixed
and
generation
-
fixed
effects
in
the
model
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Age
–
g
##eno
##type
interactions
are
also
modelled
by
the
latter
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Thus
,
correlation
estimates
obtained
are
comparable
across
co
##hor
##ts
and
age
groups
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Our
data
do
have
limitations
,
as
they
are
based
on
a
relatively
small
-
scale
co
##hor
##t
with
differential
response
rates
at
each
sweep
and
the
numbers
of
measured
children
[SEP]
[CLS]
at
age
9
was
considerably
lower
than
in
the
previous
sweep
##s
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
We
agree
that
caution
is
appropriate
accordingly
in
data
interpretation
as
the
numbers
at
age
9
are
smaller
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
previous
publications
,
we
have
reported
on
the
representative
##ness
of
the
participating
mothers
and
children
and
find
,
as
with
many
co
##hor
##ts
,
that
less
affluent
and
younger
mothers
[SEP]
[CLS]
were
less
likely
to
continue
to
participate
,
but
the
base

maternal
B
##MI
does
not
differ
between
respond

and
non

.
22
##A
##ls
##o
,
we
only
report
statistical
##ly
significant
[SEP]
[CLS]
findings
which
by
definition
are
sufficiently
powered
when
the
child
is
aged
9
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
There
may
be
some
self
-
selection
bias
in
relation
to
participating
grandparents
,
as
clearly
grandparents
who
were
deceased
could
not
participate
.
26
##I
##n
previous
analyses
,
we
have
[SEP]
[CLS]
shown
that
the
original
index
mothers
were
representative
of
the
general
population
,
22
##and
our
findings
were
consistent
across
the
three

so
we
do
not
think
self

can
be
the

for

[SEP]

In

this

shows
clear
f

across
three

[SEP]
[CLS]
This
study
is
significant
for
at
least
3
reasons
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
First
,
it
provides
a
random
##ized
trial
of
text
##4
##ba
##by
with
a
large
sample
over
the
full
course
of
the
pre
##nat
##al
text
##ing
module
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
Mad
##igan
study
was
ambitious
in
that
it
followed
a
base
##line
sample
of
nearly
1000
women
for
a
total
study
period
of
nearly
2
years
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Second
,
it
provides
one
of
the
most
comprehensive
studies
to
date
evaluating
the
effect
of
m
##H
##eal
##th
on
the
health
of
pregnant
military
female
soldiers
and
family
members
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
As
noted
,
military
women
’
s
health
is
an
under
##st
##udi
##ed
topic
and
the
multiple
stress
##ors
that
they
face
compared
to
civilian
women
suggest
that
it
deserves
greater
attention
from
[SEP]
[CLS]
m
##H
##eal
##th
and
other
health
studies
[
34
,
41
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Third
,
the
study
demonstrates
a
behavioral
effect
of
text
##4
##ba
##by
among
high
-
exposure
users
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Previous
studies
demonstrated
short
-
term
effects
on
K
##AB
among
participants
,
including
the
initial
outcomes
of
the
Mad
##igan
study
[
23
,
26
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
until
these
results
,
no
behavioral
effects
had
been
observed
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
We
found
that
among
the
subgroup
of
high

exposure
participants
,
text
##4
##ba

had
a
positive
effect
on
reducing
alcohol
use
behavior
of
pregnant
and
post
##par
##tum
women
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Specifically
,
we
disco
##n
##firmed
our
first
hypothesis
that
there
was
no
direct
treatment
effect
of
text
##4
##ba

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The

[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
we
confirmed
our
second
hypothesis
that
there
was
a

of

##4

,
with
higher

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
was
an
important
focus
of
text
##4
##ba
##by
messages
,
including
both
recommendations
not
to
drink
and
also
warnings
about
the
health
risks
of
f
##etal
alcohol
syndrome
for
un
##born
babies
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Our
results
show
that
dos
##age
was
a
predict
##or
of
lower
alcohol
consumption
response
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Although
self
-
reported
alcohol
consumption
would
be
expected
to
be
lower
after
pregnancy
given
social
cues
and
available
information
about
health
risks
for
all
participants
,
the
dose
-
[SEP]
[CLS]
response
effect
among
text
##4
##ba
##by
participants
was
pronounced
,
as
high
-
dose
participants
were
more
than
twice
as
likely
to
a
##bs
##tain
from

compared
to
low

dose
participants
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
brief
,
text
-

intervention
format
of
text
##4
##ba
##by
is
consistent
with
other
brief
pre
##nat
##al
alcohol
interventions
found
to
be
effective
in
recent
studies
[
42
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Moreover
,
descriptive
analysis
showed
that
the
quantity
of
drinking
was
lower
among
text
##4
##ba
##by
participants
post
##par
##tum
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In

,
there
were
6
messages
related
to
risks
of
alcohol
consumption
,
spread
over
the
intervention
period
,
among
the

messages
delivered
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Although
this
is
not
a
large
number
of
total
messages
,
it
is
worth
noting
that
they
reinforce
information
women
are
already

sources
regarding

[SEP]

[SEP]

The

addresses
a
wide
range
of
health
topics
,
as
compared
to
other
studies
that
focused
on
1
or
a
few
closely

[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
initial
short

demonstrated
multiple
K

[

,
and
this

demonstrated
a
behavioral

on

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Broad

can
be
effective
and
given
low

should
be
considered
as
s

[SEP]

There

It
is
important
to
recognize
that
many
individuals
who
use

receive
large

[SEP]
[CLS]
We
did
not
have

those
are

it

There
are
2
important
limitations
of
this

[SEP]
[CLS]
First
,
we
had
a
low

up

and
,
thus
,
used
imp
##uta
##tion
techniques
to
support
the
analysis
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
As
a
result
,
the
study
may
be
under
##powered
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Despite
this
fact
,
the
overall
direction
of
results
was
consistent
with
previous
text
##4
##ba
##by
studies
and
additionally
we
found
a
behavioral
effect
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Much
of
the
at
##tri
##tion
was
at
##tri
##but
##able
to
red
##ep
##loy
##ments
and
,
thus
,
lack
of
access
to
participants
at
the
Mad
##igan
clinic
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Second
,
although
we
observed
dos
##age
effects
,
we
are
only
able
to
conclude
that
higher
levels
of
text
messages
had
an
effect
on
alcohol
use
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
leaves
the
important
question
of
exact
dos
##age
and
timing
of
delivery
requirements
for
future
studies
.
[SEP]

Studies

Introduction
The
role
of
vitamin
D
in
fertility
treatment
has
been
recently
described
in
some
comprehensive
reports
[

]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Numerous
publications
pro
##claim
this
particle

pan
##ace

for
various
mental
and
so
##matic
chronic
diseases
,
while
other
advise
caution
in
pre
##s
##cribing
it
to
some
groups
of
patients
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
What
is
the
role
of
ch
##ole
##cal
##ci
##fer
##ol
in
human
reproduction
?
[SEP]
[CLS]
Should
its
supplement
##ation
become
a
golden
standard
in
fertility
treatment
,
or
do
we
still
need
more
evidence
on
its
effect
?
[SEP]
[CLS]
Today
we
know
that
,
in
a
healthy
woman
,
vitamin
D
serum
concentration
is
higher
than
in
patients
suffering
from
p
##oly
##cy
##stic
o
##var
##ies
syndrome
(
PC
##OS
)
.
[SEP]

Vita

in
patients
with

remain
unknown
,
but

Vita

stimulate
##s
anti

Müller

hormone
(
AM

)
production
as
well
,
which
is
highly
correlated
with
o
##var
##ian
reserve
preservation
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Likewise
,
in
patients
with
vitamin
D
deficiency
,
a
higher
occurrence
of
u
##ter
##ine
my
##oma
##s
is
observed
—
another
established
reason
for
in
##fer
##tility
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Moreover
,
it
was
found
that
a
high
concentration
of
ca
##l
##cid
##iol
is
related
to
greater
end
##ome
##tri

incidence
,
which
was
explained
by
dim

##shing
elimination
of
end

that
pass
to

decrease

but
also

their

Therefore
,
a

must
be
careful
when
pre

##cribing
vitamin

preparations
,
especially
in
male
patients
.

was
strongly

With
regards
to
waiting
time
at
the
clinic
,
the
women
recognized
that
most
of
the
time
wasting
was
due
to
late
coming
of
their
fellow

.

with

especially
for

[SEP]
[CLS]
They
were
impatient
because
they
claimed
they
had
other
pre

##ations
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Furthermore
,
respond

had
some
reservations
with
respect
to
the
sitting
comfort
in
some
health

,
complaining
that
the

were
too
hard
and
lacked
back

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
women
with
high
level
of
education
and
women
attending
for
their
first
pre
##gna
##ncies
were
not
satisfied
with
the
competence
of
the
staff
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Most
of

recommended
an
improvement
in
the

[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
women
attending
for
their
subsequent
pre

##ncies
and
those
at
their
third
or
more
visits
were
more
tolerant
of
the
services
provided
at
the
health
centres
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
is
probably
because
their
contact
with
the
health
system
had
tailored
their
expectations
and
they
expressed
satisfaction
with
the
existing
services
.
[SEP]

There
were
significant

[SEP]
[CLS]
Women
attending
AN

for
their
subsequent
pre
##gna
##ncies
probably
had
a
notion
of
what
health
topics
were
discussed
during
clinic
sessions
and
so
their
objectives
at
AN
##C
were
not
only
aimed
[SEP]
[CLS]
at
acquiring
knowledge
about
diet
,
danger
signs
and
other
topics
but
also
in
the
state

[SEP]

on

expected

[

.
[SEP]

C

with
a

were
less

with
the

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
They
were
more
interested
in
having
an
in
##de
##bt
knowledge
on
how
complications
arising
during
pregnancy
could
be
managed
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
predominant
topics
discussed
during
health
talks
were
h
##ygiene
and
nutrition
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
There
were
post

on
the

breast
##fe

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Focus
##ing
on
post

issues
was
not
usually
appealing
to
pregnant
women
who
were
more
eager
to
learn
about
labor
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
an
Australian
study
showed
that
both
women
and
providers
thought
the
time
for
ant
##ena
##tal
classes
was
too
small
to
incorporate
all
they
had
to
learn
with
some
women
[SEP]
[CLS]
complaining
of
having
received
too
much
information
[
29
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
overall
satisfaction
of
the
women
attending
AN
##C
in
the
study
health
district
was
high
(
91
.
4
%
)
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
These
results
are
similar
to
other
studies
of
patient
satisfaction
;
(
96

5

)
in
I
##bad

Nigeria
[

.
4
%
in
O

[SEP]
[CLS]
State
,
Nigeria
[
25

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
it
has
been
said
that
the
views
of
pregnant
women
concerning
their
care
is
generally
positive
as
they
tend
to
be
un
##c
##ritic
##al
of
healthcare
,
accepting
whatever
care
[SEP]
[CLS]
they
receive
as
appropriate
[
29
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Thus
using
patient
views
to
evaluate
health
care
has
been
criticized
[
30
]
,
regarding
their
responses
as
a
mixture
of
the
healthcare
performance
measurement
and
the
respond
##ent
'
s
[SEP]
[CLS]
reflection
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Nevertheless
,
patient
views
provide
an
insight
to
the
care
provided
and
the
system
as
a
whole
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
influence
of
the
educational
level
of
respond
##ents
is
predominant
here
as
it
is
noticed
that
those
at
a
high
educational
level
are
more
likely
to
be
critical
about
care
[SEP]
[CLS]
received
and
def
##er
a
positive
satisfaction
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
issue
was
also
revealed
in
F

and
colleagues

study
[

where
they
h
##y
##pot

##ized
that
as
the
level

in
the

steadily
increases
,
pregnant
[SEP]
[CLS]
women
may
become
more
and
more
critical
of
health
care
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Hence
there
is
a
need
to
mob
##ilize
efforts
for
a
better
quality
assessment
in
our
health

provision
with
the

those

these

In

[SEP]
[CLS]
This
is
of

Understanding

is
that
it

the

of

[SEP]

Not

is
it
unlikely
that
a
human
would
receive
this
,
or
any
,
environmental

via
the
same
route
of
administration
,
but
also
the
way
in
which
[SEP]
[CLS]
an

is
administered
determines
its
overall

[SEP]
[CLS]
Indeed
,
oral
administration
of

to

(
the

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Thus
,
while
it
is
important
to
fully
character

the
hazard
,
further
studies
at
doses
and
routes
of

similar
to
those
found

are
necessary
for
determining

[SEP]

It
is
worth
noting
,
however
,
that
establishing
the
actual
level
of
human
exposure
to
a

and
mimic

it

is
not

[SEP]

Met

Thus

can
vary

resulting
in
the
production

important

The
timing

can
also
be
a
major
contributing
factor
to
the
significance
of
the

[SEP]
[CLS]
As
discussed
earlier
,
some
life

may
be
more

to
a

[SEP]

There
was
the

However
,
it

also
be

Finally
,
humans
are
continuously

Multiple

[SEP]

While
a

multiple

Furthermore

Of

it

[SEP]

However
,
the
situation
is
often
not

For

,

‘

of
an

while
mini

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
is
where
dose

level
of
exposure
and
relevance
to
humans
is
crucial
,
but
considerations
of
alternative

are
also
important
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Do
we
run
the
risk
of
banning
a

that
does
not
demonstrate
any
e

toxicity
at
the
levels
found
within

only
to
replace
it
[SEP]
[CLS]
with
an
alternative

characteristics
and

we
know
even
less
about
?
[SEP]
[CLS]
Surely
,
it
is
better
for
both
society

to
fully
assess
the

Despite

that
the

[SEP]

This
might
well
be
expected
since
the
fundamental
idea
that

can
induce

across
multiple
generations
challenges
the

,
moving

[SEP]

While
many
hundreds

,
relatively
few
(

they

Taking

these

Regarding

,
a

have
demonstrated

However
,
it
is
unknown
whether
changes
in
nutrition

by
maternal

restriction
during

could
modify
the

explanation

that
the

be

[SEP]
[CLS]
Returning
to
our
data
,
weight
recovery
in

may
occur
as
a
result
of
an
accelerated
catch
-
up
growth
before

caused
by
an
ad

[SEP]

[SEP]

The

to
the

in

sexual
dim
##or

during

The

indicated
that

compared

[SEP]

As
we

discuss
below

these

extend
to
metabolic

as

Thus
,
the
effects
of
the

should
be
interpreted

[SEP]

it

In

In

it

It
is

is
adjusted

the

seems

discrete

One
possibility

emerges
from

is
that

can
increase
their

by
either
a
reduction

A
major
issue
in

is
the
need
for

the

the

[SEP]

Since
the

needed
to
control
the
three
phases
of
the

,
including
morning

afternoon

[SEP]
[CLS]
we
had
to
use
randomly

female

[SEP]

This
limitation
has
to
be
considered
in
the

further

evaluate
the
reasons

However

it

As

our

that

pre

Moreover
,
the
outcomes
of
the

enhance
the
importance
of
the
per

period
as
well
as
the
role
of
maternal
diet
in
the
early

programming
,
due
[SEP]
[CLS]
to
the
fact
that
the
maternal

was
implemented
before

and

were
raised
in
an

this

the
early

Since

that
most

Because

There

some

[SEP]
[CLS]
First
,
in
cause
of
the
difficulties
in
performing
infant

,
relatively

[SEP]

The

,
a
rainy

whose

have
a
higher
risk

than
elsewhere
due
to
lack

[SEP]

[

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
our
study
,
the
mean
25
(
OH

D
level
of
the
maternal

was
low
,
at
15

,
which
might
hind
##er
our
investigation
[SEP]

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Third
,
a
large
percentage
of
infants
in
the
low
cord
25
(
OH

D
group
were
male
,
although
our
previous
study
found
no
gender
difference
in
the
[SEP]
[CLS]
infant
lung
function
test
[
18
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Furthermore
,
the
measurement
of
respiratory
mechanics
relies
on
both
the
absence
of
air
##flow
and
the
in
##vocation
of
the
Her

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Although
this
technique
is
relatively
non
##in
##vasive
and
easy
to
perform
,
there
is
limited
evidence
showing
that
the
R
##rs
is
sensitive
enough
to
distinguish
between
different
groups
of
infants
with
[SEP]
[CLS]
various
clinical

[
54

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Therefore
,
defining
the
ca

relationship
between
R
##rs
and
clinical
outcomes
in
infants
with
low
cord
serum
25
(
OH
)
D
levels
is
difficult
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Last
,
the
sample
size
was
rather
small
,
and
the
vitamin
D
levels
of
the
participants
were
generally
sub
##op
##ti
##mal
in
our
study
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Although
poor
lung
function
performance
and
an
increased
risk
of
respiratory
tract
infection
were
related
to
relatively
low
cord
serum
vitamin
D
levels
,
further
extra
##pol
##ating
the
effects
of
vitamin
[SEP]
[CLS]
D
on
the
respiratory
function
of
the
general
infant
population
might
still
be
difficult
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
conclusion
,
this
study
is
the
first
to
reveal
that
infants
with
low
cord
serum
25
(
OH
)
D
levels
have
poor
##er
lung
function
at
6
months
of
[SEP]
[CLS]
age
compared
with
those
with
high
levels
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
They
also
have
a
higher
risk
of
a
respiratory
tract
infection
before
this
age
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Although
cord
vitamin
D
levels
are
strongly
correlated
with
maternal
vitamin
D
levels
,
the
extent
of
the
impact
on
later
respiratory
function
is
distinctive
.
[SEP]

We
believe
that
this
study
provides
a
clearer
understanding
of
the
effect
of
per

Our

of

found
an

On

numerous

the

##s
or
health
complications
during

and
the

shows
that
the
timing
of
these

with
[SEP]

respect
to

of
g

could
be
associated
with

[

,
[

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
We
acknowledge
the
following
limitations
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
First
,
from
2007
–
2013
,
the
Government
of
Nicaragua
provided
in
##fluenza
v
##ac
##cin
##ation
only
for
pregnant
women
with
chronic
conditions
[
34
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
2013
,
the
in
##fluenza
v
##ac
##cin
##ation
recommendation
was
extended
to
all
pregnant
women
in
the
Municipality
of
Man
##agu
##a
,
and
in
2014
,
the
Government
of
Nicaragua
extended
in
##fluenza
v
##ac
##cin
##ation
[SEP]
[CLS]
to
all
pregnant
women
in
the
country
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
little
is
known
about
how
well
the
recommendations
were
implemented
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Indeed
,
vaccine
up
##take
remained
somewhat
higher
among
pregnant
women
with
pre
-
existing
chronic
medical
conditions
in
our
study
year
suggesting
that
the
recommendation
may
have
been
slow
to
[SEP]
[CLS]
take
effect
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Higher
v
##ac
##cin
##ation
among
pregnant
women
with
high
-
risk
pre
##gna
##ncies
could
have
caused
a
selection
bias
as
those
v
##ac
##cin
##ated
women
would
have
been
at
higher
risk
for
adverse
pregnancy
outcomes
[SEP]
[CLS]
compared
to
un
##va
##cci
##nated
women
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Second
,
the
sample
was
not
randomly
selected
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Women
who
agreed
to
participate
in
the
study
could
have
been
different
from
women
who
did
not
participate
in
the
study
,
and
we
did
not
collect
characteristics
on
women
[SEP]
[CLS]
who
refused
to
participate
in
the
study
to
as
##cer
##tain
this
bias
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Third
,
we
did
not
power
the
sample
size
to
analyze
effects
by
trim
##ester
of
v
##ac
##cin
##ation
and
so
may
have
missed
important
effects
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Fourth
,
we
based
our
calculation
of
g
##esta
##tional
age
at
delivery
on
L
##MP
which
is
known
to
be
subject
to
recall
bias
and
could
have
introduced
errors
in
our
calculations
[SEP]
[CLS]
[
53
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
when
L
##MP
was
determined
to
be
unreliable
,
we
calculated
g
##esta
##tional
age
at
delivery
using
data
from
an
ultra
##sound
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Approximately
6
%
of
the
g
##esta
##tional
age
estimates
came
from
ultra
##sound
##s
in
the

Introduction

Studies
have
focused
particularly
on
the
potentially
beneficial
effects
of
anti
##ox
##ida
##nts
,
following
the
hypothesis
that
a
declining
intake
of
anti
##ox
##ida
##nts
in
Western
##ised
countries
has
led
to
a
reduction
in
[SEP]
[CLS]

hence
to
an
increase
in

of

atop

in
recent

[

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
An
alternative
hypothesis
,
which
has
received
less
attention
,
is
that
the
epidemic
of
as
##th
##ma

atop

in
the
West
could
partly
be
explained
by
an
increasing
diet

of
foods

constituents
which
may
be
harmful

[SEP]

Between

we

might
have

[SEP]

However
,
it
could
be
argued
that
,
for
our

to
be
totally
spur

in
those
included

analysis
(
and
for
the
associations
to
be
truly
null
[SEP]
[CLS]
in

,
associations
in
the

would
have
to
be
in
the
opposite

much
stronger
,
compared
with
the
[SEP]

reported

which
seems

[SEP]

Furthermore
,
loss

shown
to
only
slightly
modify

and
the

confirmed
that

In

the
post

we
cannot
exclude
the
possibility
that
the

occurred
[SEP]

by
chance

hence
,
they
should
be
interpreted
with
caution
.
[SEP]

Given
the

and
the
fact

it
did
not

to

[SEP]

However

we

may
increase
the

calculating

Both
of

advantages
compared

other

LA

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
First
,
each

between

to

chemicals
with

between
any
given
chemical
and

[SEP]

Having

com

the
interpretation
of
associations
between
the
5
E
##DC
classes
and
birth
weight
when
using
traditional
multi

linear
methods
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
B
##HL
##M
examines
the
average
effect
of
E
##DC
exposure
on
birth
weight
at
the
class
level
using
the
parameter
μ
##β
,
which
is
less
susceptible
to
random
variation
[
[SEP]

]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
A
second
advantage
of
reporting
μ
##β
##is
that
it
prevents
the
investigator
from
only
reporting
chemicals
that
are
significantly
related
to
birth
weight
by
virtue
of
it
being
an
average
association
[SEP]
[CLS]

a

the

[SEP]
[CLS]
For
example
,
rather
than
sorting
through
23
PC
##B
##s
to
identify
those
that
are
significant
,
we
simply
reported
the

[SEP]
[CLS]
A
final
advantage
of
Bay

is
that
posterior

of
the
re

are
s

,

rate
when
the

estimates
are
used
for

[SEP]
[CLS]
There
were
several
limitations
to
the
study
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
First
,
the
B
##HL
##M
model
did
not
account
for
interactions
between
classes
,
and
we
assumed
that
all
chemicals
within
a

share
a
similar
mode
of
action
and
arise
[SEP]
[CLS]
from
a
common
prior
distribution
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Second
,
the
model
also
excluded
non

linear
relationships
,
including
potential
threshold

Living

increases
the

,
in

In

However

they

results
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
we
observed
that
vitamin

deficiency
at
delivery
was
more
prevalent
in
mothers
with
G
##DM
compared
with
non

mothers
,
but
this
was
not
marked
during

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This

was
possibly
con

by
smoking
,
which
was
more

in

G

compared
with

[SEP]
[CLS]
Nevertheless
due
to
small
number
of

we
could
not
investigate
this
re
##lia
##bly
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
accordance
with
other
studies
,
our
results
imply
that
in
a

,
the

Similarly
,
Josef

stated
that

not

which

Furthermore

some

with

[SEP]
[CLS]
It
is
possible
that
in

was
performed
,
the
association
between
25

,
only

concluded
that

for
a

between

[

.
[SEP]

Some

[SEP]

In

the

of

A

a

between
maternal

and
f

outcomes
in
a

[SEP]

In
many

participants
had
various
ethnic
backgrounds
which
could
affect
both
vitamin

and
their

G

[

[SEP]

A
strength
of
the
present
study
lies
in
the
recruitment
of
subjects
,
which
took
place
in
a
single
hospital
,
enabled
standard
##ised
data
collection
and
covered
all

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
a
multi

study
might
have
resulted
in
a
wider
variety
of
socio

economic
backgrounds
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
A
challenge
in
previous
studies
on
vitamin
D
status
and
G
##DM
has
been
the
lack
of
relevant
adjustments
,
for
example
adjustments
for
B
##MI
and
smoking
status
[
6
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
the
present
study
,
we
have
systematically
investigated
con
##found
##ers
between
groups
,
and
adjusted
for
those
when
applicable
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
threshold
for
defining
vitamin
D
deficiency
and
the
diagnostic
criteria
for
G
##DM
vary
between
studies
,
which
might
affect
the
results
and
com
##plicate
the
comparison
of
studies
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
A
further
limitation
is
that
the
O
##G
##TT
was
not
performed
on
all
mothers
,
and
a
slight
possibility
exists
that
the
actual
prevalence
of
G
##DM
might
be
under
##est
##imated
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Yet
,
our
main
results
were
repeated
in
a
subgroup

of
only
those

whom
an
O

[SEP]

In

the
prevalence
of

was
in

with

[

.
[SEP]

found
that
up

could

Iron

[SEP]

Due

it

the

The

South

are
limited

To
the
best
of

this
is
the
first
South

study
focusing
on
the
assessment
of
both
maternal
diet

and
nutrition

in

pre

##ally
and
to
investigate
associations
with
outcomes
of
maternal
and
infant
health
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
study
is
novel
due
to
the
comprehensive
set
of
nutrition
related
data
and
indicators
of
maternal
and
infant
health
being
obtained
in
a
South
African
setting
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Therefore
,
this
ex
##p

project
will
contribute
to
identifying
factors
that
may
be
targeted
in

pre

conception
maternal
interventions
for

and
possibly
reduction
in

NC
##D
risk
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
study
also
has
its
challenges
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
inclusion
and
exclusion
criteria
for
participants
were
designed
as
such
to
obtain
a
sample
of
generally
healthy
women
,
who
are
able
to
speak
the
local
language
and
who
[SEP]
[CLS]
could
be
followed
-
up
from
early
pregnancy
until
the
infants
are
12
months
old
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
South
African
statistics
show
that
only
52
%
of
women
attend
ant
##ena
##tal
care
before
20
weeks
’
g
##esta
##tion
[
30
]
,
thus
access
to
women
early
in
pregnancy
is
restricted
[SEP]
[CLS]
and
limits
en
##rol
##ment
into
the
study
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Furthermore
,
many
healthcare
facilities
in
Johannesburg
serve
a
predominantly
migrant
population
[
81
]
posing
a
challenge
for
longitudinal
data
collection
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Additionally
,
these
women
may
choose
to
eat
traditional
foods
[
82
]
that
do
not
form
part
of
the
South
African
Food
Database
for
nutrition
##al
analysis
;
and
may
[SEP]
[CLS]
not
be
able
to
speak
a
local
language
[
83
]
ha
##mper
##ing
detailed
reporting
during
diet
##ary
assessments
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Thus
,
mi
##grating
women
or
those
unable
to
speak
local
languages
could
not
be
included
in
the
study
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
A
limitation
of
the
study
is
that
women
who
fit
the
inclusion
criteria
are
invited
to
join
the
study
by
visiting
the
data
collection
site
at
an
agreed
date
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Having
this
option
of
attending
may
contribute
to
self
-
selection
bias
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Our
recruitment
data
to
date
indicate
that
of
those
invited
to
take
part
in
the
study
;
only
approximately
50
%
arrive
at
the
data
collection
site
on
the
booked
[SEP]
[CLS]
date
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Even
so
,
this
study
will
provide
a
comprehensive
and
unique
database
from
an
urban
South
African
setting
which
will
allow
for
cross
-
section
##al
,
prospective
and
retrospective
analyses
[SEP]
[CLS]
to
describe
the
nutrition
##al
status
and
diet
##ary
intake
of
pregnant
women
,
and
to
determine
associations
with
health
outcome
measures
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
These
results
will
supply
context
to
intervention
studies
with
the
aim
to
improve
maternal
as
well
as
offspring
health
in
South
Africa
.
