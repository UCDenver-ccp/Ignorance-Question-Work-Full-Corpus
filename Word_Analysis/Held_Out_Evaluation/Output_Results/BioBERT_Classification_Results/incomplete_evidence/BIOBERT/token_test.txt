Introduction
Based
[SEP]
[CLS]
on
clues
from

,
we
have
proposed
that
low
pre

##al
vitamin
D
may
be
a
risk
factor
for
later
development
of
s
##chi
##zophrenia
[

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Many
studies
have
shown
that
those
born
in
winter
and
spring
have
a
significantly
increased
risk
of
developing
s
##chi
##zophrenia
[

,
and
that
those
born
at
higher
latitude
##s
are
[SEP]
[CLS]
also
at
increased
risk
of
s
##chi
##zophrenia
[

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Given
that
vitamin
D
levels
in
the
population
flu
##ct
##uate
across
the

and
decrease
across

,
low
pre

vitamin
D
‘
fits

these

is
therefore
a

In

[SEP]
[CLS]
Given
that
this
is
the
first
study
to
be
conducted
among
pregnant
women
,
and
that
pre

B

may
reasonably
be
considered
a
con

or
a
co

along
[SEP]
[CLS]
the
ca
##usal
pathway
between
maternal

##ual
sleep
behaviors
and
G

,
we
were
careful
to
assess
the
potential
independent
contributions
of
the
sleep
variables
(
from
pre

B
##MI
[SEP]
[CLS]

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
distinction
is
important
because
adjustment
for
co

along
the

pathway
may
spur
##iously
at
##ten

estimates
of

[SEP]
[CLS]
Therefore
,
we
constructed
additional

that
simultaneously
adjusted
for

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
We
also
reported

that
we

could
assess

Our

by
adding

[SEP]
[CLS]
Our
present
pilot

has
several
important
strengths
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
First
,
our
determination
of
maternal
sleep
duration
and
s
##nor
##ing
was
based
on
reports
made
early
during
pregnancy
,
so
reporting
was
not
conditional
on
pregnancy
outcomes
or
on
signs
[SEP]
[CLS]
and
symptoms
of
G
##DM
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Our
results
suggest
that
habit
##ual
short
/
long
sleep
duration
and
s
##nor
##ing
pre
##cede
the
clinical
diagnosis
of
G
##DM
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Second
,
the
high
follow
-
up
rate
(
>
95
%
)
minimize
##d
possible
selection
bias
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
several
limitations
merit
discussion
and
consideration
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Mat
##ern
##al
habit
##ual
sleep
duration
and
s
##nor
##ing
was
obtained
from
self

report
,
and
thus
are
likely
susceptible
to
mi
##s
##c
##lass
##ification
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Report

known
to
be
only
moderately
correlated
with
wrist
act
##ig
##rap
##h

measured

(
ρ

47
)
,
and
reports
are
generally
longer
by
[SEP]
[CLS]
approximately
34
minutes
for
each
hour
of
objective
##ly
measured
sleep
[
39
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
use
of
self
-
reported
s
##nor
##ing
as
a
tool
to
detect
sleep
disorder
##ed
breathing
is
well
established
.
[SEP]

In

that

,
especially
in

[

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
S
##nor
##ing
that
is
in
##f

or
non

has
not
been

necessary

and
therefore

Introduction
Iron
deficiency
an
##ae
##mia
is
defined
as
an
##ae
##mia
accompanied
by
depleted
iron
stores
and
signs
of
a
compromised
supply
of
iron
to
the
tissues
[
1
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
There
is
variation
in
ha
##em
##og
##lo
##bin
levels
during
pregnancy
;
at
the
beginning
of
a
pregnancy
,
there
is
a
normal
reduction
in
ha
##em
##og
##lo
##bin
level
followed
by
a
slight
rise
towards
[SEP]
[CLS]
the
end
of
pregnancy
[
2
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
initial
reduction
has
been
explained
to
result
from
increased
red
cell
mass
and
demands
of
the
f
##etus
which
exceeds
iron
intake
with
con
##se
##quent
reduction
in
iron
stores
of
the
[SEP]
[CLS]
woman
'
s
body
[
2
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Thus
,
the
World
Health
Organization
has
defined
an
##ae
##mia
in
pregnancy
as
a
ha
##em
##og
##lo
##bin
value
below
11
g
/
d
##L
[
1
,

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
There
are
two
known
factors
which
contribute
to
development
of
iron
deficiency
an
##ae
##mia
(
ID
##A
)
in
pregnancy
;
the
first
is
the
woman
'
s
iron
stores
at
the
[SEP]
[CLS]
time
of
conception
and
the
second
is
the
amount
of
iron
absorbed
during
g
##esta
##tion
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
fact
that
an
##ae
##mia
frequently
does
occur
in
pregnancy
among
women
in
developing
countries
is
an
indication
that
pre
##ex
##ist
##ing
iron
stores
are
often
inadequate
and
physiological
adaptations
to
pregnancy
are
[SEP]
[CLS]
insufficient
to
meet
the
increased
requirements
[
4
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Hence
,
iron
supplement
##ation
in
pregnancy
has
become
a
standard
and
routine
practice
as
a
prevent

for
iron

The
high
physiological
requirement
for
iron
in
pregnancy
is
difficult
to
meet
with
most
diet
##s
;
this
is
so
especially
in
developing
countries
where
food
requirement
is
[SEP]
[CLS]
a
problem
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
During
pregnancy
,
iron
requirements
are
not
uniform
[
14
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
the
first
trim
##ester
,
daily
needs
decrease
due
to
the
absence
of
men
##st
##ru
##ation
;
thereby
saving
about
0
.
56
mg
of
iron
per
day
,
or
160
mg
[SEP]
[CLS]
for
the
pregnancy
[
15
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
the
second
trim
##ester
,
blood
volume
increases
by
45
%
with
an
increase
in
plasma
volume
of
50
%
;
red
cell
mass
is
raised
by
35
%
which
amounts
[SEP]
[CLS]
to
about
450
mg
of
iron
in
a
55
kg
woman
[
4
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Fe
##tal
demands
for
iron
are
ma
##ximal
during
the
third
trim
##ester
and
these
are
estimated
at
about
270
mg
in
a
3
kg
f
##etus
[
16
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Therefore
,
an
average
daily
dose
of
4
–
6
mg
of
iron
is
required
in
the
second
and
third
trim
##ester
##s
of
pregnancy
[
14
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Overall
,
a
woman
requires
about
2
–
2
.
8
mg
of
iron
per
day
during
pregnancy
[
17
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
But
she
will
need
to
consume
much
more
to
obtain
this
daily
requirement
(
i
.
e
.
,
between
20
and
48
mg
of
diet
##ary
iron
)
[
18
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
literature
has
presented
different
views
on
iron
requirements
during
pregnancy
ranging
from
450
to
1
,
150
mg
with
a
median
of
79
##0
mg
[
14
,
19
[SEP]
[CLS]
–
21
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Since
these
requirements
are
difficult
to
meet
through
an
ordinary
diet
,
especially
in
developing
countries
where
most
diet
##s
do
not
contain
adequate
bio
##ava
##ila
##ble
iron
,
routine
iron
supplement
##ation
in
[SEP]
[CLS]
pregnancy
has
been
found
to
be
of
immense
benefit
[
14

19

[SEP]

Iron
deficiency
in

populations
can
be

and

[SEP]

However
,
there
is
a
limitation
to
the
use
of
some
of
these
bio

indicators
of
iron

in
certain
settings

;
thus
,
ne

[SEP]

For

,
serum

,
being
an
acute

protein
,
is
raised
in

;
it
can
therefore
give

a

The
first
choice
in
the

of
iron

an

for
almost
all

is
oral
iron

because
of
its
effectiveness

and
low

[

[SEP]
[CLS]
Oral
iron
,
either
as
iron
su

or
f
##uma
##rate
,
is
the
most
commonly
used
prevent
##ive
treatment
for
iron

and
iron
deficiency
an
##ae

in

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Direct
iron
supplement
##ation
has
been
extensively
used
in
most
developing
countries
as
an
intervention
to
prevent
iron
deficiency
and
consequently
an
##ae
##mia
during
pregnancy
[
7
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Thus
,
prevent
##ive
treatment
with
iron
supplement
##s
has
always
been
given
in
combination
with
f
##olic
acid
and
this
has
been
included
as

of
routine
ant
##ena

care
provided
to
pregnant
[SEP]
[CLS]
women
at
every
visit
in
developing
countries
[
26

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
rational
##e
for
this
combination
is
to
meet
increased
f
##olic
acid
requirements
in
pregnancy
brought
about
by
the
rapidly
dividing
cells
in
the
f
##etus
and
elevated

The
International
N

Group
had
recommended
a
daily
dose
of
60
mg
of
iron
for
pregnant
non

##em

women
,
if
supplement
##ation
for
more
than
six
months
is
possible
[SEP]
[CLS]
before
delivery
[
27

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
An
increased
daily
dose
of
120
mg
of
iron
is
further
suggested
if
the
duration
of
supplement
##ation
in
pregnant
non

##em
##ic
women
is
shorter
or
where
the
prevalence
of
iron

[SEP]
[CLS]
in

is
high
or
in
settings
where
pregnant
women
are
generally
an
##ae
##mic
[
27

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
supplement
should
include
400
μ

or
lower

Iron

involves
the

to
an
appropriate
food
vehicle
that
is
made
available
to

[SEP]

Food
fortification
with

has
thus
become
a
promising
approach
for
preventing

an
##ae

in

in

[SEP]

Iron

of

effective
in

the

##ation
among

are
highly

[SEP]

In

it
is

in

The

has
recommended
that
weekly
iron
and
f

supplement
##ation
should
be
considered
as
a
strategy
for
prevention
of
iron
deficiency
in
population
groups
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
is
particularly
so
where
the
prevalence
of
an
##emia
is
above
20
%
among
women
of
reproductive
age
[
58

.
[SEP]

Since
iron
tablets
induce
a
high
concentration
of
free
radical
##s
in
the

##inal
mi
##lie
##u
,
which
may
damage
the

the
minimal
essential
iron
dose
is
to
be
[SEP]
[CLS]
recommended
[
59

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Therefore
,
there
is
a
need
to
establish
effective
and
safe
doses
of
supplement
##al
iron
with
f
##olic
acid
either
as

[SEP]
[CLS]
Though
compliance
with
weekly
dos

may
be
better
than
daily
regime
##n
because
of
reduced
side

,
it
is
desirable
to
conduct
further
field
random
##ized
controlled
trials
in
order
to
[SEP]
[CLS]
establish
the
efficacy
of

[SEP]
[CLS]
Alternatively
,
an
equally
effective
,
safe
,
and

iron
compound
with
little
or
no

can
be
developed
for

[SEP]
[CLS]

[SEP]

To
this

we
recommend
a
cue
to
be
taken
from
new
approaches
to
iron
fortification
technology
development
whereby
iron

[SEP]

While
this
approach
is
being
pursued

we
recommend
that
appropriate
measures
be
taken
to

In
the
absence
of
survey
data
from
other
European
countries
,
we
suspect
that
the
prevalence
of
vitamin
D
deficiency
in
Belgium
likely
reflects
the
situation
in
other
Western
European
[SEP]
[CLS]
countries
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
assumption
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
main
risk
factors
associated
with
vitamin
D
deficiency
(
sun
exposure
and
/
or
ethnicity
)
are
common
to
many
European
[SEP]
[CLS]
countries
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
addition
to
the
uncertainty
concerning
the
optimal
vitamin
D
intake
##s
preventing
vitamin
D
deficiency
,
there
exists
also
a
lack
of
recommendations
to
treat
vitamin
D
def
##icient
pregnant
women
[SEP]
[CLS]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Even
in
the
last
published
guidelines
the
treatment
of
vitamin
D
def
##icient
women
is
not
specifically
discussed
[
24

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
un
##cover
##ing
of
the
magnitude
of
vitamin
D
deficiency
in
pregnant
women
in
Belgium
(
and
Western
Europe
)
should
be
translated
into
new
research
in
order
to
fill
the
[SEP]
[CLS]
huge
knowledge
gap
concerning
the
adequate
amount
of
vitamin
D
to
prevent
and
treat
vitamin
D
def
##icient
pregnant

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
addition
,
an
increasing
number
of
studies
suggest
that
g
##esta
##tional
vitamin
D
deficiency
is
associated
with
multiple
adverse
health
outcomes
in
mothers
and
children
[
16

–
[

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Therefore
,
there
is
an
urgent
need
of
random
##ised

of
vitamin

supplement
##ation
to
investigate
the
maternal

health
benefits
of

vitamin

during

[SEP]
[CLS]
Given
the
high
prevalence
of
vitamin
D
deficiency
in
pregnant
women
in
Belgium
and
probably
in
many
European
countries
,
a
vitamin
D
nutrition
policy
is
needed
at
the
country
[SEP]
[CLS]
and
European
level
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
current
vitamin
D
recommendations
for
pregnant
women
are
clearly
insufficient
to
prevent
and
even
more
to
treat
vitamin
D
def
##icient
pregnant
women
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Until
the
adequate
treatment
of
vitamin
D
def
##icient
pregnant
women
is
established
,
a
safe
approach
may
be
to
correct
vitamin
D
deficiency
by
targeting
pregnant
women
at
high
risk
[SEP]
[CLS]
of
severe
vitamin
D
deficiency
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
addition
the
current
vitamin
D
content
of
multi
##vi
##tam
##ins
for
pregnancy
,
400
I
##U
,
do
not
even
comply
with
the
current
Belgian
recommendations
of
800
I
##U
per

,
[SEP]
[CLS]
therefore
a
p
##rud
##ent
step
should
at
least
be
to
increase
the
vitamin
D
content
in
multi
##vi
##tam
##ins
for
pregnant
women
to
800
I
##U
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
conclusion
,
despite
that
more
than
60
%
of
the
pregnant
women
reported
taking
multi
##vi
##tam
##ins
containing
vitamin
D
,
vitamin
D
deficiency
is
highly
prevalent
among
pregnant
women
in
[SEP]
[CLS]
Belgium
and
up
to
12
%
of
pregnant

are
severely

[SEP]
[CLS]
A
targeted

strategy
to
detect

is
clearly
needed
in

[SEP]

A

over

suggested
that

suggest
potential

Our

lie

it

difficult

make
a

as
the

very
wide

we
recorded
the

[SEP]

without
focusing

[SEP]
[CLS]
It
could
be
argued
that
as
routine
pre
##nat
##al
care
in
Romania
does
not
usually
begin
until
after
the
first

almost

,
including
advice
about
f
##olic
acid
as
[SEP]
[CLS]
part
of
pre

##al
care
is
redundant
as
the
neural
tube
has
fully
developed
within
28
days
of
conception
[

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Nonetheless
,
f
##olic
acid
supplement
##ation
might
address
other
forms
of
an
##ae
##mia
,
and
the
advice
might
also
increase
the
likelihood
of
f
##olic
acid
use
before

Among
the

independently
[SEP]

could
be
a
consequence

social
in
##e
##qui

or
particular
health
beliefs

The

the

,
after
[SEP]

adjusting

[SEP]

The
observation
that
early
registration
with
a

in

was
associated
with
f

could
indicate
the
recognised
importance
of
early
pre

.
[SEP]

Furthermore
,
it
is
perhaps
un

##rising
that
women
with
higher
educational
achievement
and
also
those
with
greater
engagement
with

had
better

Important
##ly
,
we
also
found
that
less

were
more
likely
to
take

.
[SEP]

This
suggests
that
the
interventions
(
pre

)
are
productive
,
and
that
the
Romanian
government
should
seek
ways
of
encouraging

to
participate

stressed
that

This

a

when
there
is
no
strong

for
the

[SEP]

Some

describe
a
positive

between
the

but
others
have
reported
an
inverse

[

.
[SEP]

There
is
also
evidence
of
a

between
engagement

[SEP]

This

is
not

;
instead
,
we
evaluated

in

to
the

[SEP]
[CLS]
The
content
of
pre

,
including
nutrition
##al
education
,
is
an
important
factor
that
could
determine
the
use
of

during

,
but
women
may
also
receive
advice
[SEP]

from

[SEP]

In
our

,
women

were
more
likely
to

Thus
,
even
though
there
is
no
consensus
on
recommend

the

they

the

the

This

especially
f

[

[SEP]

We
mit

##d
against
this
possible
source
of

by
asking
additional
questions
about
the
type

its
commercial

[SEP]

This
was
the
first

not

[SEP]

Having
done
so
,
however
,
some
of
our

may
not
have
accurately

their
use
of
supplement
##s
early
in

or
before
conception

[SEP]

Even
though
our
results
highlight
the
importance
of
nutrition
##al
knowledge
in
the
decision
to
use
iron
or
f
##olic
acid
,
we
cannot
draw
conclusions
about
overall
compliance
with
supplement
regime
##s
[SEP]
[CLS]
,
because
we
did
not
record
the

of

f

or
multi

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Furthermore
,
we
did
not
record
when
during
the

the
supplement

were
taken
,
which
is
of
particular
importance
for
f
##olic
acid
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
sample
size
of
our
study
was
determined
based
on
an
unknown
prevalence
of
supplement
##s
intake
(
which
was
set
by
default
to
be
50
%
)
,
but
may
have
been
[SEP]
[CLS]
too
small
to
accommodate
some
subgroup

;
we
must
therefore
be
cautious
about
the
conclusions
that
can
be
drawn
from
subgroup
analysis

test
the
h

that
arise
from
[SEP]
[CLS]
these
findings
in

[SEP]

As
this
is
an
observation

,
we
cannot
conclude
that
the
information
about
the
roles
or
sources
of
nutrients
or
general
recommendations
about

during

directly
influence
the
[SEP]

The

to

While
historical
evidence
suggests
that

can
prevent

onset
and

,
much
of
this
research
has
been
overlooked
[
18
,
29
,
30
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
a
pilot
study
published
in
2012
,
we
were
the
first
to
specifically
report
differences
in
actual

between
children
with

without
[SEP]
[CLS]
severe

[

[SEP]

The
present
study
involved
a
substantially
larger
sample
,
and
reinforce
##s
the
observed
association
between
25
(
OH
)
D
levels
and
S
-
EC
##C
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Much
of
the
early
research
in
this
field
was
conducted
by
May
Mel
##lan
##by
,
who
identified
an
association
between
vitamin

supplement
##ation
and
reduced

[
18

[SEP]
[CLS]

]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Recently
,
a
meta
-
analysis
reported
that
vitamin
D
supplement
##ation
in
childhood
can
help
prevent
car
##ies
[
30
]
,
and
it
has
also
been
suggested
that
concentrations
of
25
[SEP]
[CLS]
(
OH
)
D
between
75
–
100
nm
##ol
/
L
may
reduce
the
risk
for
car
##ies
[
22
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Our
study
supports
these
findings
,
as
car
##ies
-
free
children
were
twice
as
likely
to
have
optimal
25
(
OH
)
D
concentrations
(
≥
75
nm
##ol
/
L
)
[SEP]
[CLS]
and
those
with
S
-
EC
##C
were
at
nearly
three
times
the
odds
of
having
def
##icient
levels
(
<
35
nm
##ol
/
L
)
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
mean
25
(
OH
)
D
level
in
our
sample
was
adequate
,
mirror
##ing
our
pilot
study
findings
[
14
]
and
those
of
the
Canadian
Health
Me
##asures
Survey
[SEP]
[CLS]
[
32
]
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
may
be
attributed
to
regular
milk
intake
,
which
was
common
in
both
groups
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Regular
milk
drink
##ers
had
better
vitamin
D
concentrations
,
a
finding
supported
by
a
large

scale
clinical
study
observing
an
association
between
frequent
milk
consumption
and
increased
25

[SEP]
[CLS]

[

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Reg
##ression
techniques
were
employed
to
determine
whether
the
association
between

and
vitamin

remained
after

Even
after

,
low

,
and
in
##f
##re

of

,
the
significant
association
remained
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Similarly
,
the
association
between
25
(
OH
)
D
concentrations
and
S
-
EC
##C
was
significant
after
log
##istic

while

for
factors
such
as
general

,
[SEP]
[CLS]
the
age
when
teeth

first
started
,
and
household

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
As
there
was
a
strong
relationship
between
education
and
income
,
education
was
not
included
in
the
model
to
avoid
multi

co
##linear
##ity
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Our
study
also
reports
that
those
with
S

had
significantly
lower
calcium
and
elevated
PT

,
as
observed
in
our

These

,
included
in
the
re

as
they
were
strongly
correlated
with
25

D
levels
.
[SEP]

This
multi

these

Our

The

[SEP]

Additionally
,

Natural

,
some

Fortunately
,
we

[SEP]

Additionally
,
the

involved

compared

This

be
associated
with
a
number
of
com

,
including
insulin

,
has
become
a
major

and
has
reached
epidemic
proportions

in
high

It
is
defined
as
an

Ex
##cess
weight
is
usually
defined
by
the

is
18

,
although
the

may
vary
for

.
[SEP]

##are
considered
to

[SEP]
[CLS]
In
general
,
the
term
o
##besity
applies
to
both
the
o

and
the

subjects
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
More
than
the
total
body
weight
,
the
distribution
of
the
stored

is
of
importance
for
the
development
of

its

(
in
the

,
is
associated
[SEP]
[CLS]
with
a
much
higher
risk
for
several
diseases
than
excess

.

is
present
even
in

indicating
a

Although
the

extremely
complex
and
is
far
from
being

In

Q

,
it
was
estimated
that

can
burn
as
much
as
20

(

As
an
example
,
in
a

with
63
g

,
it
was
calculated
that
if

,
it
would
burn
an
amount
[SEP]

It
can
therefore
be
concluded
that
,
even
though
the
BA

are
present
in
small
amounts
,
the

has
the
potential
to
substantially
contribute

(

BA

activity
is
well
known
to
mostly
rely

UC

being
directly

by

(

[SEP]

Along

it
was

coupled
to

could
be
another

Similarly
to
what
was
proposed
for
skeletal
muscle
(
Du

,
this
may

Introduction
Au
##tism
is
a
complex
condition
that
lacks
an
established
method
of
prevention
;
thus
there
is
a

research
to
identify
its
possible

Statistical
estimates
show
that
one
out
of
every
88
individuals
in
the
United
States
is
diagnosed
with
autism
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
condition
may
be
defined
as
a
chronic
ne
##uro
##de
##vel
##op
##mental
disorder
that
first
becomes
prevalent
in
an
individual
during
his
/
her
early
childhood
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Consequently
,
autism
results
in
a
patient
experiencing
a
life
that
is
marked
by
the
ongoing
challenge
of
its
negative
effects
on
communication
and
interaction
with
others
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
disorder
is
de
##bil
##itating
for
the
patient
and
immensely
challenging
for
his
/
her
family
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
An
initial
diagnosis
of
autism
occurs
as
an
individual
is
notice
##ably
unable
to
achieve
certain
early
childhood
milestone
##s
in
terms
of
communication
and
social
##ization
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Furthermore
,
while
the
incidence
and
the
prevalence
of
autism
also
tend
to
raise
on
an
ever
-
increasing
basis
,
public
health
concerns
over
the
disorder
have
also
been
[SEP]
[CLS]
coupled
with
concerns
over
its
et
##iology
,
which
is
still
in
the
investigative
stage
of
clinical
research
[

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Initial
research
efforts
,
which
were
embarked
upon
during
the
1950s
,
assert
that
complications
in
a
given
pregnancy
,
the
birth
##ing
process
,
and
the
incidence
of
autism
are
[SEP]
[CLS]
linked
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Over
the
past
several
decades
,
continuing
research
has
been
conducted
,
and
much
literature
has
been
published
that
has
supported
the
existence
of
the
links
between
autism
and
factors
[SEP]
[CLS]
that
relate
to
pre
-
,
per
##i

,
and
neon

##l
care
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Such
commonly
identified
,
pre

risk
factors
may

Another

may

that

engage

has
arguably

Accordingly
,
population

,
which
have

,
have
reported

[SEP]

It

however

that

each

the

Thus
,
significant
correlation

With
the

were
at
44

lower

risk
of

In

Although

Indeed

The

tested

consisted
of

“

There
was
no

and
thus
,
it
is
not
clear
whether
the

an

A
barrier

A
limitation
of
this

was
that
nearly
two

of
the

63

had
only
one
25

which
[SEP]
[CLS]
prohibited
assessment
by

a
more
thorough

of

among
those

low

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
This
is
due
to
follow

up

being
on
the

still

which
is
automated
as
part
[SEP]
[CLS]
of
the

pre
##nat
##al
screening
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Additionally
,
the
initial
test
was
not
automated
until
May
2016
so
many
women
who
delivered
during
the
early
study
time
period
did
not
have
a

and
therefore
could
not
be

in

[SEP]

Since
this

implemented

there
have
been
ongoing

There

a

[SEP]

First
,
due

[SEP]
[CLS]
As
such

confirmation

is
needed
as
it
is
possible
that

we

(

[SEP]
[CLS]
This
may

,
although
our

are
similar
to
other
small

(

Furthermore
,
in

we
performed

previously

[SEP]
[CLS]
In

,
common

is
associated
with

A
limitation
of
this

is
that
information

[SEP]

Survival

[SEP]
[CLS]
Since
there
were
few

the

used

Therefore
,
the

Another

is
that

which
provides
a

throughout

Low

are

[CLS]
on

[

[SEP]
[CLS]
There
is
increasing
evidence
that

some

[

play
an
important

in

[SEP]

Earlier
studies
have
also
shown
that
high

in
the

of

is
positively
associated
with
birth

including
birth
weight
and
birth

[

[SEP]
[CLS]

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
due
to
a
wide
range
of
nut
##rient
interactions
,
maternal
diet
##ary
patterns
should
be
explored
to
achieve
the
association
between
maternal

and
f

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
It
is
noteworthy
that
there
are
few
studies
assessing
the

along
the
maternal

[

[SEP]
[CLS]
Diet
##ary
patterns
are
different
based
on
cultural

geographical

influence
in

area
and
can
have
effects
on
health

[

Limited

So

the

This

be
a
reason
why

[SEP]

Iranian

means
that

Another
point
that
needs

be

the

[SEP]
[CLS]
Lac
##k
of

an
issue
in

[SEP]
[CLS]
In
this
regard
,
in

should
be
identified
on
the
basis
of
measures
of
f

,
rather
than

[

[SEP]

In

,
residual
con

due

not
be
excluded
,
although
we
controlled
some
important
potential
con

[SEP]

Therefore
,
these
potential
limitations
should
be
considered
in
the
interpretation

However
,
the
main
strengths

the
current

include

statistics

[SEP]

Another
positive
point
is
that
few
studies
have
collected
data

[SEP]
[CLS]
In
summary
,
evaluation
##s

indicate
that

,
in

With

reported
both
in
Australia

New

,
as
well

[

,
there
is
continuing
interest
[SEP]
[CLS]
in
determining
how
vitamin
D
deficiency
may
influence
health
in
pregnancy
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Evidence
suggests
that
vitamin

is
associated
with
a

of

on

[

.
[SEP]

This
may
be
explained

in

by

There

numerous

have

that

is
associated
with

(

Previous

are
known
to
affect

therefore
influence
study

.
[SEP]
[CLS]
Furthermore
,
the
g

at
which

is
also
important

[SEP]

However
,
measuring

is
common
and
